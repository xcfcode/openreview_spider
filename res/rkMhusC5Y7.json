We also found that tuning the hyperparameters need to be done carefully to avoid unstable training or very low-performing sub-agents. Randomly partitioning the training set is easy to be done and we found that training is stable for all sub-agents as well as they end up having similar individual performance but different policies.\n\n\nQuestion 3: The baseline is much lower than the current SOTA systems. Such as the best result on SearchQA in this paper is 50.5 in terms of F1 score. However, R3 and Re-Ranker obtain 55.3 and 60.6 respectively. Could the proposed approach be adapted to those models? Note that those SOTA systems are released.\n\nAnswer: We have new results using a SOTA system as an environment (Devlin et al., 2018, \u201cBERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\u201d), and will add them to the paper.\n\n\nQuestion 4: The proposed system is quite similar to Nogueira & Cho 2017 and Buck et al. 2018. I'm not very sure the contribution of this work and its novelty.  \n\nAnswer: Although in their papers they show improvements using a single agent, scaling up to multiple agents by simple averaging their final predictions does not work, as shown by the performance of RL-10-Ensemble (table 1, 4-5th rows). In this work, we provide a simple method to combine the multiple agents that led to much higher performance.\n\n\nQuestion 5: Why the authors didn't use beam search during the sub-agent training?\n\nAnswer: Using greedy and beam search decodings during training do not work because they do not allow for the exploration of new, unknown, rewrite strategies, which are fundamental to the agent to learn new, and possibly better, reformulation strategies. In other words, greedy and beam search decodings produce the best rewrite that has been successful so far, and they do not try new rewrites. Additionally, beam search is more expensive because for each original question there will be N calls to the environment (where N is the beam size). Since those calls are the slowest part of our pipeline, training time will be roughly N times slower. On the other hand, sampling from the decoder gives the agent the ability to explore with sometimes random rewrites while requiring only one environment call per original question.\n\nQuestion 6: It seems that the proposed framework is a pipeline model: firstly it trains a bunch of sub-agents; and then trains meta-agent. Is it possible to fine-tune the model jointly?\n\nAnswer: We tried to fine-tune the model jointly but did not notice any improvement in performance. One advantage of the 2-step training we used is that we can preprocess and store all the reformulations and answers obtained by reformulators so that the aggregator training becomes much faster because it does not require any environment call, which is the slowest part in our pipeline.\n\nQuestion 7: What is Extra Budget in Table 1?\n\nAnswer: It is the RL-10-Full trained for the same amount of time as an RL-10-Ensemble. This experiment was to show that our method keeps improving even when we use 10x more training time.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Coordinate Multiple Reinforcement Learning Agents for Diverse Query Reformulation", "abstract": "We propose a method to efficiently learn diverse strategies in reinforcement learning for query reformulation in the tasks of document retrieval and question answering.

Any form of training that biases the agents, including training on semantically-motivated query clusters, will lead to a poor test/generalization performance. We will include this comment in the paper.\n\nQuestion 2: It\u2019s also not clear why training the reformulating agents individually on these partitions would do better than an ensemble.\nAnswer: When trained on the full dataset, each agent in the ensemble needs to find a single policy that is good for the whole dataset. If we partition, then the policy of each agent needs to be good only for a fraction of the training examples. This increases the diversity of policies because the agents see different training examples. With higher diversity, we are able to achieve better ensemble performance. For a similar result, please see Parascandolo et al., 2018. \u201cLearning Independent Causal Mechanisms,\u201d section 5.3, paragraph \u201cA simple single-net baseline.\u201d\n\nQuestion 3: Why does the function for z_j in equation 2 need to be so complicated?\nAnswer:  Although equation 2 could be a simple concatenation of query and doc embeddings (table 8, 2nd row), we found that the more complicated version gave us a higher performance with minimal extra processing time. \n\nQuestion 4: Why are the CNN features of the query concatenated twice in the first part.\nAnswer: The query vector is concatenated with the element-wise multiplication of the query and document vectors, and the element-wise subtraction of the query and document vectors. We will change the notation to make this clear.\n\nQuestion 5: What does the dot operator in the second part of the equation correspond to?\nAnswer: It is the element-wise multiplication of two vectors. We will add this description to the text.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Coordinate Multiple Reinforcement Learning Agents for Diverse Query Reformulation", "abstract": "We propose a method to efficiently learn diverse strategies in reinforcement learning for query reformulation in the tasks of document retrieval and question answering.

This can speed up the training thanks to parallelization. They observed that this can improve the diversity of learnt reformulations and the overall performance in some cases. \n\n\nStrengths\n1. The paper is clear and easy to follow.\n2. Multiple evaluation metrics and baseline models are considered\n\nWeaknesses\n1. The proposed method is simple and lacks novelty.\n2. The performance improvement is marginal and some empirical results are not carefully analyzed. \n\n\nSignificance\nExploring a diverse set of strategies is beneficial in reinforcement learning. This paper focuses on two aspects of this problem. One is how to learn diverse agents and the other one is how to efficiently learn these agents efficiently, which are important concerns in practice. \n\n\nOriginality\nThe model learning approach they proposed is merely a simple variant of ensemble learning. The main difference is they train sub-agents on disjoint partitions of the training data, which seems a trivial modification although this shows to improve the overall model performance.\n\n\nTechnical Quality\nOverall, the experiments are well-thought, but the following questions need to be explained:\n1.\tIn the Introduction, the authors claim three contributions they made in this paper. My question is, if the third one is really an important contribution, why didn\u2019t the authors demonstrate it in detail in the main text? Attaching it to the appendix could make the reader confused about its significance.\n2.\tIn Table-1, the authors claim that their proposed architectures can outperform the baseline RL-10-Ensemble with only 1/10 time. The sub-agents are trained on a partition of the training set. My question is, are these sub-agents trained in parallel on different machine? If so, why cannot the RL-10-Ensemble be trained in parallel through some multithread or distributed computation? The implementation of the proposed model and the baseline seems not that fair.\n3.\tThe main architecture is described in section 3.3 and 3.4, including the Sub-agents and the Aggregator. However, in Appendix C.1, the authors claim that the gains the proposed method comes mostly from the pool of diverse reformulators, and not from the simple use of a re-ranking function (Aggregator). This is confusing because if it is true, the proposed method is really reduced to an ensemble of the baseline model.\n4.\tIn Table-2, some of the results are worse than the baseline methods like Re-Ranker. Although the authors claim the re-ranking is a post-processing, Re-Ranker performs significantly better than the proposed model. If the authors want to better demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model, a comparison between the proposed model with re-ranking and the Re-Ranker is required.\n5.\tIn Table 10, why the proposed method fails to produce the right answer whereas the other methods perform well?\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper391/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Coordinate Multiple Reinforcement Learning Agents for Diverse Query Reformulation", "abstract": "We propose a method to efficiently learn diverse strategies in reinforcement learning for query reformulation in the tasks of document retrieval and question answering.

A meta-agent, known as the aggregator, groups and scores answers from the sub-agents for any given input. \n\nEach agent produces a unique reformulation that is applied to the environment, producing an answer for the reformulated query. The aggregator receives the original query and the answers provided by the environment and produces a relevance score for each answer with respect to the original query that is a function of both components.\n\nThe final answer is select using this relevance score, as well as an aggregate ranking score for over the space of reformulations for each answer.\n\nThe aggregator is trained to minimize the cross-entropy of the relevance score. Each reformulation agent is trained using Recall@40 as a reward for retrieving the correct answer from the environment given their reformulation. \n\nThe authors argue that learning multiple specialized sub-agents is easier than learning a generalist agent responsible for being able to model the entire training data. Authors shows that this strategy is even more generalizable than training an ensemble for the same number of agents over the entire training set. Authors apply the approach to query reformulation for document retrieval and QA.\n\nReview:\n\nPros:\n-The paper provides convincing empirical evidence that training multiple distinct agents on different partitions of a dataset to learn to reformulate queries for environment feedback is a more efficient and accurate approach than training single or ensemble model on the whole dataset. Empirical result show that both the addition of the aggregator and the exclusivity of the agents contributes to this effect. Baselines are considerable and in-depth (though it seems like the Hui et al., 2017 model that is SOTA on TREC-CAR could be shown in Table 1 as well)\n-The paper is well written and easy to understand in the approach.\n\nCons:\n-The authors could do a better job explaining a couple of unclear points. First, how did the authors come up with equation 2 for computing the relevance score? While the empirical investigation in Table 8 indicates it does better than other simpler formulations, it\u2019s not clear why the authors were motivated to try this one.\n-I don\u2019t come away with an idea of WHY the author\u2019s proposed approach works better. While the empirical investigation is a contribution in it of itself, the results seem slightly counterintuitive. It\u2019s not clear why a random partition should be better than a semantically-motivated partition. It\u2019s also not clear why training the reformulating agents individually on these partitions would do better than an ensemble. I find the paper interesting, but the analysis of these results is missing.\n\nQuestions:\nWhy does the function for z_j in equation 2 need to be so complicated?

For example, the report paper from 2017's top submission system shows ~2.3 points lower MAP scores than the ones published in the overview paper (https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec26/papers/MPIID5-CAR.pdf, table 3).\n\nThe numbers we report in the paper are the non-inflated ones (i.e., computed with the \"-c\" option in the trec_eval tool) hence the lower numbers.\n\n2.

The UNH.bm25 achieves a MAP of 12.2, RPrecision of 9.7, MRR of 18.3, and NDCG of 19.6.  UNH.expan achieves a MAP of 14.4, RPrecision of 11.4, MRR of 21.2, and NDCG of 22.6.  These can be found here: https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec26/appendices/car.html\n\n2. Did you stop and stem for your baselines (Lucene, PRF, and RM3)?
