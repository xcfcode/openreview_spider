To clarify, our method regularises the topology of the latent space as an *additional* objective. The goal is to obtain a latent space whose topology is similar to that of the input space (as approximated on the level of mini-batches). Therefore, we consider the small increase in MSE to be the \u2018price to pay\u2019 for obtaining a better (in terms of its topology) latent representation. To illustrate this point, imposing structural restrictions at the minimal cost of increased reconstruction error is comparable to the relationship between SOM and the standard k-means approach.\n\n> The work is missing a mandatory comparison with Hofer et al. (2019b)\n\nThank you for pointing this out. While our work is related to Hofer et al. (2019b) the objective of this work is different. Hofer et al. propose regularizing the connectivity of the latent space by itself, whereas our goal is to align input and latent space in terms of connectivity. In particular Hofer et al. show that it could be beneficial for some downstream task (such as classification) to enforce certain topological properties in a representation and allow to tune these properties in the latent space. By contrast, we propose a method for dimensionality reduction which should *preserve* the topology of a data space in the latent space, to allow a better understanding and visualization of the high-dimensional data space. This is why (in contrast to Hofer et al.) we refrain from using the latent space as a basis for a classification task as it is not clear why the preserved data space topology would be beneficial for classification (as opposed to e.g. disentangled latent representations). We make this distinction now more clear in the paper to reduce confusion. \n\n> Computational issues of the $d$-dimensional Vietoris--Rips computation\n\nThank you for raising this important point. This is a general limitation of persistent homology computations at the moment; it is not a specific limitation of our approach. However, we expect that forthcoming improvements in implementations (for example, GPU implementations or optimised implementations such as U. Bauer\u2019s \u2018Ripser\u2019) or in approximation techniques will address this. As a side-note, we also want to mention that the question of the contribution of higher-dimensional features is not fully answered yet; some papers, such as Hofer et al. (2017) or \u2018Learning metrics for persistence-based summaries and applications for graph classification\u2019 by Zhao & Wang empirically found that higher-dimensional topological features are not required for tasks like graph classification.\n\nPlease let us know if there are any other questions that we can answer for you concerning this paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper901/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper901/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["michael.moor@bsse.ethz.ch", "max.horn@bsse.ethz.ch", "bastian.rieck@bsse.ethz.ch", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch"], "title": "Topological Autoencoders", "authors": ["Michael Moor", "Max Horn", "Bastian Rieck", "Karsten Borgwardt"], "pdf": "/pdf/2aace4cb0fa32bcbed6432ecfa5a1b8e2d13c44d.pdf", "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for preserving topological structures of the input space in latent representations of autoencoders.

Our loss can generally be computed for higher-dimensional topological features as well. This requires pairing a given edge of the Vietoris--Rips complex with the higher-order simplex it is creating or destroying during filtration. This works because the Vietoris--Rips complex is a clique complex, i.e. its structure is completely determined by its edges. For this paper, we implemented dimensions 0 and 1; for the data sets that we analysed, we saw no benefits in 1-dimensional features; only the runtime increased. This is not a universal claim, though, and we believe that there are other data sets that exist that require higher-dimensional topological features.\n\n>  [...] but the encoder introduces, e.g., cavities in the data\n\nAn autoencoder might possibly introduce higher-order topological structures to the latent space if not being \u201cpunished\u201d for doing so; however, AEs are also not incentivised to do so,\nwhich might be why we did not observe the value of adding 1-dimensional features. Interestingly, there are symmetry properties of PH that lead to some redundant information in  higher-dimensional features; this restricts the potential of AEs to introduce additional information without noticing it in lower-dimensional features. Please see https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10208-008-9027-z for more details.\n\n> L_t = 0 [...]\n\nThanks for pointing this out! If the persistence diagrams and pairings are the same, $L_t =0$, provided the distances are scaled properly. The converse does not necessarily hold. We now mention this in the paper. We do not merely try to arrive at identical entries in the persistence diagrams (irrespective of the underlying pairing), which could be achieved by minimising the distance $\\|A^X[\\pi^X] - A^Z[\\pi^Z]\\|$, for example. For such a loss term, which disregards the minibatch sample indices, zero loss would imply equal persistence diagrams; however, the loss would not punish \u201cmeaningless\u201d latent spaces that do not represent samples correctly. For example, imagine a minibatch of 3 non-collinear samples forming a triangle in data space (see A.10). If the latent space shows the exact same triangle shape but with permuted labels (sample indices), the alternative loss term (oblivious to the pairings) would not punish this.\n\n> Use of Euclidean distance\n\nFor reasons of clarity and to harmonise our setup, we used the Euclidean distance in the paper. The choice of distance influences to what extent PH is able to capture topological features\u2014it is therefore crucial, but typically, suitable results can be achieved with Euclidean distances. However, our method supports different distances, which we now discuss more prominently in the paper. For higher dimensions, it would be interesting to employ fractional metrics instead. Iit would also be possible to compute the distance using activations of intermediate layers of pretrained convolutional neural networks in order to derive a \u201cmore meaningful\u201d distance metric. We consider these promising directions for future work. In this paper, we focused on adjusting the topologies between input and latent space without introducing another layer of complexity.\n\n> Fuzzy visualization of CIFAR-10\n\nIn our experiments, CIFAR-10 proved to be challenging to directly compress to 2D as compared to weaker bottlenecks (e.g. 100 dimensions) followed by t-SNE. Since our aim was dimensionality reduction and visualization, we uniformly chose two latent dimensions for all data sets.\n\n> Thm. 1/2\n\nBoth theorems prove that subsampling of a point cloud is valid, insofar as it still captures similarity between persistence diagrams well. Our theoretical setup is simpler than that of Chazal et al., who discuss subsampling from a measure-theoretical point of view. Thm. 1 is a proof of the stability of the PH calculation at the minibatch level, while Thm. 2 bounds  the distances of persistence diagrams as the subsample size $m$ increases. Both theorems discuss the robustness of point cloud subsampling irrespective of belonging to the input space or the latent space. That is, even though the latent space changes during training, at each step during training, the PH of the latent minibatch $Z^{m}$ is a robust approximation of the PH of the full data set in latent space (at this moment in training). \n\n> KL divergence\n\nWe discuss the details of KL divergence calculations in Section A.6. The computation requires a base distance (where we use again the Euclidean distance; please also see the point above), which might be susceptible to noise. We follow the setup of Chazal et al. (2011, 2014b), but it will be interesting to consider the impact of other distances in future work.\n\n> Typos in Section 6\n\nWe also rewrote Section 6 and corrected typos.

This is realized via an additional (i.e., in addition to reconstruction) loss term (optimized over mini-batches) which requires differentiating through the PH computation. While this has been done before (e.g., Chen et al., Hofer et al.), the authors have certainly put an interesting spin on this. The theoretical part of the work deals with the issue of using mini-batches for PH computation and whether this computation is close to the computation on the full point cloud. Experiments and comparisons on multiple datasets are presented to demonstrate that the approach, e.g., preserves nesting relationships in the input. The paper is nicely written and the content is very well presented. There are questions here and there (see below), but I do think they can be answered.\n\nMajor comments/remarks:\n-------------------------------------\n\nMy first question relates to the issue that the loss only incorporates 0-dim. information. The authors do remark that higher-dim. features can be included, but the results were similar. However, after thinking about this issue quite some time, I am curious if it is possible to obtain \"zero\" of the topological loss (so this term is perfectly optimized), but the encoder introduces, e.g., cavities in the data which were not present in the input (e.g., 1-dim. holes).\n\nAlso, can you show formally (maybe this is trivial and I am not seeing it) that L_t = 0 would lead to 0 distance between the corresponding diagrams w.r.t. some common metric? A more formal treatment of the implications of the loss in Eq. (2) would certainly help.\n\nAnother question that immediately comes to mind is whether the computation of VR PH in the input space (e.g., CIFAR 10) makes sense, as the authors rely on ||.||_2 if I understood this correctly. I would argue that the topology of the input is basically unknown, especially for images and computing Euclidean distances among images, or vectorized images, does not make sense. For the nice results on the SPHERES data set it does, as the spheres are defined exactly using ||.||_2. If the VR PH in 0-dim. of the input is enforced upon the representations in the AE bottleneck, but the input topology is not captured well, then you might be enforcing something that you possibly do not want.\n\nApart from that, it is known that the Euclidean distance degenerates quickly in high dimensional spaces, e.g.,\n\nAggrawal et al.\nOn the Surprising Behavior of Distance Metrics in High Dimensional Space\n\nMaybe this is also contributing to the fuzzy visualization of CIFAR-10 in Fig. 3 (apart from the low-dim. of the bottleneck)?\n\nAlso, maybe the authors could work out (in greater detail) the differences between their results from Thm.1/2 and the results of Chazal et al., in \"Subsampling Methods for Persistent Homology\". In my point of view, the results in the paper only hold if you would consider just a single batch, right? I mean, if the loss is computed from the batch, and a gradient update is performend, Z^{m} will changes (as the encoder changes as a result of the update), while the input does not. \n\nFinally, how were the KL divergence measures in Table 1 computed, as you need a density estimate of the input as well, not just for the representation space, right? Is this not a very crucial issue in the input space? If so, how reliable are the numbers presented for KL_{0.01},etc., given that the differences are sometimes extremely small.\n\nMinor comments\n-----------------------\n\nSec. 6: We presented a topological autoencoders -> We presented a topological autoencoder\n\nOverall, I think this is a nicely done paper, but with quite some question marks at many places. I do think this is always the case for something new, though, and \nactually a good thing."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper901/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper901/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["michael.moor@bsse.ethz.ch", "max.horn@bsse.ethz.ch", "bastian.rieck@bsse.ethz.ch", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch"], "title": "Topological Autoencoders", "authors": ["Michael Moor", "Max Horn", "Bastian Rieck", "Karsten Borgwardt"], "pdf": "/pdf/2aace4cb0fa32bcbed6432ecfa5a1b8e2d13c44d.pdf", "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for preserving topological structures of the input space in latent representations of autoencoders.

The general aim is to preserve the topological properties of data while performing dimensionality reduction. \n \nThe proposed method computes the persistent homology of the 0-dimensional Vietoris\u2013Rips by means of persistence diagrams and persistence pairing. The additional step is to computes the regularization loss, by posing the constraint that the persistent homology be similar between data space and latent space. The empirical analysis investigates the stability property with respect to the mini-batch sampling. \n\nThe extended experiments don't provide an empirical evidence of the added value of a topological AE. The results are quite controversial if we focus our attention on MSE measures. AE and TopoAE behave in a similar way and it is not clear whether such a difference is statistically significant. \n\nThe work is missing a mandatory comparison with Hofer et al. (2019b) that proposes a loss very similar to the one presented in Section 3, even though the authors remark that their formulation is more general. For example an interesting comparison could have been with the real-case application of classification for the images datasets (e.g. CIFAR, MNIST, ImageNet) where Hofer et al. (2019b) proves their claims.\n\nThe computational issues of the d-dimensional Vietoris-Rips with d > 0, limits the preservation of only simple structures in the point-cloud.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper901/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper901/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["michael.moor@bsse.ethz.ch", "max.horn@bsse.ethz.ch", "bastian.rieck@bsse.ethz.ch", "karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch"], "title": "Topological Autoencoders", "authors": ["Michael Moor", "Max Horn", "Bastian Rieck", "Karsten Borgwardt"], "pdf": "/pdf/2aace4cb0fa32bcbed6432ecfa5a1b8e2d13c44d.pdf", "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for preserving topological structures of the input space in latent representations of autoencoders.
