Some complexity comes from the fact that the multi-sample-baseline is much easier derived when instead sampling with replacement as common in related work.\n\nThis paper relies heavily on previous work that established the \"Gumbel top-k trick\" which allows sampling without replacement, but self-sufficient given the references. Their new contribution is a gradient estimator based on sampling without replacement, including a variant with a baseline that is based on the other samples produced for the same example (e.g. different translations for the same source sentence).\n\nExperiments on a TSP solver show that sampling several times per input example performs better than doing a single sample and on-par with a computationally expensive version where roll-out is used to produce a baseline for the single sample case. Furthermore sampling without replacement seems to work slightly better than with replacement. That being said, the latter seems much easier to implement.\n\nThe proposed approach might be a good fit for the somewhat nice setting where one trains on few examples and samples from a peaked distribution where sampling the same sequence repeatedly would be an issue.\n\nOverall this paper is very pleasant to read and presents the flow of ideas well.\n\nThe work is accompanied by a detailed proof that the derived estimator is unbiased. Skimming the proof revealed no issues but I could have missed something here.\n", "rating": "4: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/drlStructPred/Paper4/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/drlStructPred/Paper4/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Buy 4 REINFORCE Samples, Get a Baseline for Free!", "authors": ["Wouter Kool", "Herke van Hoof", "Max Welling"], "authorids": ["w.w.m.kool@uva.nl", "h.c.vanhoof@uva.nl", "m.welling@uva.nl"], "keywords": ["reinforce", "multiple samples", "baseline", "sequence generation", "structured prediction", "travelling salesman problem"], "TL;DR": "We show that by drawing multiple samples (predictions) per input (datapoint), we can learn with less data as we freely obtain a REINFORCE baseline.", "abstract": "REINFORCE can be used to train models in structured prediction settings to directly optimize the test-time objective.
