It is true, in this paper, we have used identity mapping for the clean and low-resolution images as a preprocessing. This was the result from our experiments, not necessarily obvious one. There could be better preprocessing for low-resolution images that we haven\u2019t explored. \n\nQ3 - lightweight preprocessing\n(Ans) Please see the table 5. Also, it is obvious that average filter requires less computation than the denoise net since denoise net includes average filter as a part (Please see the section 3.2 Pre-processing for the noisy images). \n\nQ4 - Figure 5:\n(Ans) We have changed the figure.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Mixture of Pre-processing Experts Model for Noise Robust Deep Learning on Resource Constrained Platforms", "abstract": "Deep learning on an edge device requires energy efficient operation due to ever diminishing power budget.

Instead, we have shown sample images in figure 5 to show the effect of MoPE.\n\nQ2 - what happen if you use only one of the trained experts for all the clean/noisy  test data?\n(Ans) Please check the performance of the model 4 in table 2. Model 4 uses denoise network as a preprocessing for all the clean/noisy data without having gating network. The denoise net is trained on the noisy images with various noise levels including the clean images. When sigma is 0, the input image is actually the clean image (Please see the section 5 for implementation details). \n\nQ3 - It is not clear how you combined the results of the two experts.\n(Ans) Please see the figure 1. The shape of the preprocessing output is the same with that of the input image. Once we obtain the pre-processed images, the coefficient of the gating network is multiplied per each pre-processing and summed. The sum of the coefficients of the gating network is 1 as the output of the gating network is softmax function (See the section 4.2 for details).\n\nQ4 - Did you try to use a hard decision gating at test time?\n(Ans) No, we have used the same configuration as for the training time.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Mixture of Pre-processing Experts Model for Noise Robust Deep Learning on Resource Constrained Platforms", "abstract": "Deep learning on an edge device requires energy efficient operation due to ever diminishing power budget.

Existing denoising techniques like BM3D [1] require significant computation per image, thus, are not practical to be used in real time embedded system. And use of gating network for avoiding smoothing when not required is not necessarily obvious. Gaussian noise is random, thus, one might think it is hard to learn pattern of gaussian noise using neural network which is considered to be good for the data having pattern. And we have showed that we can distinguish the clean and noisy images with gating network.\nInstead, we have added comparison between data augmentation techniques, with/without gating network and with/without fine-tuning to show the effect of the proposed MoPE in table 2/3/4.\n[1] K.

The proposed method is composed of two components; a denoising network that suppresses the noise signals in an image, and gating network that predicts whether to use the original input image or the one produced by the denoising network. The proposed idea is evaluated on three tasks of object detection, tracking and action recognition. \n\nOriginality and significance:\nThe originality of the paper is very limited since the paper simply combines the existing image denoising technique with the idea of gating. The practical significance of the work is also limited since the model is trained and evaluated with only synthetically generated noise patterns; it is not surprising that the proposed method (both denoising and gating networks) works under this setting, as the noise is created synthetically under the same setting in both training and testing. To demonstrate the practical usefulness, it would be great if the model is evaluated with the actual source of noises (e.g. noises from input sensors, distortion by image compression, etc).  \n\nClarity:\nI think the title of the paper is misleading; the proposed model is actually not a mixture of preprocessing units, as it combines *a* denoising unit together with identity mapping. The gating network is also not designed to incorporate a mixture of more than two preprocessing units, as it outputs only \u201con/off switches\u201d instead of weights for K mixture components (K>2).\n\nMinor comments:\n1) the paper argued the importance of lightweight preprocessing but have not provided analysis on computation costs. From the current results, I don\u2019t see the clear benefit of the proposed method (denoising network) over the average filtering considering the tradeoff between computation vs. performance. \n2) In Figure 5, I suggest highlighting the differences among the examples for clarity.\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper878/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Mixture of Pre-processing Experts Model for Noise Robust Deep Learning on Resource Constrained Platforms", "abstract": "Deep learning on an edge device requires energy efficient operation due to ever diminishing power budget.
