With the proposed framework, authors are able to learn a representation which is comparable to traditional differential or integral invariants, as evaluated on few toy examples.\n\nThe paper is generally well written and shows an interesting application of the Siamese architecture. However, the experimental evaluation and the results show that these are rather preliminary results as not many of the choices are validated. My biggest concern is in the choice of the negative samples, as the network basically learns only to distinguish between shapes at different scales, instead of recognizing different shapes. It is well known fact that in order to achieve a good performance with the contrastive loss, one has to be careful about the hard negative sampling, as using too easy negatives may lead to inferior results. Thus, this may be the underlying reason for such choice of the negatives? Unfortunately, this is not discussed in the paper.\n\nFurthermore the paper misses a more thorough quantitative evaluation and concentrates more on showing particular examples, instead of measuring more robust statistics over multiple curves (invariance to noise and sampling artifacts).\n\nIn general, the paper shows interesting first steps in this direction, however it is not clear whether the experimental section is strong and thorough enough for the ICLR conference.

Our response is as follows: \n\nAbout the negative examples: We like to highlight that analogous to Euclidian curvature, our goal in this paper is to train for a local descriptor of the curve (a feature for every point of the contour) and NOT a global shape descriptor (a feature for the entire shape as a whole) usually used for classifying shapes. This implies that a negative example is something that has to be different locally, for all points on the curve. \n\nA negative example is obtained by pairing a curve with its much smoothed or evolved counterpart (after euclidian transformations of course), because, if we observe the curve locally at any point,  the analogous point in the smooth curve would have destroyed important features of the contour and this is NOT something we want our learned descriptor to have.   \n\nAs you have rightly pointed out: \u201c using too easy negatives leads to inferior results \u201c. What we wish to highlight is that the theorems by Hamilton and Grayson (Section 4, second paragraph) define a geometric notion of this \u201ceasiness\". It says that any closed curve can be abstracted to various levels using mean curvature smoothing. The highest level is a circle, which has a constant curvature for every point. This is exactly in sync with the contrastive loss function of the siamese network. If we do not provide any negative example (the easiest training possible), we expect a constant function as the network output, analogous to a constant curvature. As we begin to provide negative examples with increasing richness profiles as in Table 1, we make it less and less easier for training, thereby discovering a scale-space of signatures which is \u201clearned\" rather than axiomatically constructed as demonstrated in Figure 6.  \n\nThe novelty in our paper is first, to show this connection between classical theorems in differential geometry and modern deep-learning systems, and second, to highlight that these learned signatures have better numerical properties as compared to their axiomatic counterparts. Although we agree that a larger evaluation set would be useful, we do not believe it would change the core results presented here.

Our response is as follows: \n\nThe choice between a parametric 1D form or a 2D implicit representation of a shape fundamentally changes the approach of the underlying research.  For this work we made the specific choice of using a parametric curve representation since our main purpose was to connect the theory of differential geometry of curves with the computational engine of a convolutional neural network. This choice led us to relate powerful mathematical theorems of curves and curve evolution with the contrastive loss-function of metric learning, thereby providing a geometric insight into the action of a convolutional neural network in the learning process. Even though, the differential geometric analysis of curves is indeed an old topic, we feel that it's connection to modern deep learning systems is worthy of highlighting, thereby making a stronger case for using learning methods in different areas. The choice of using MPEG7 and extracting curves with bwboundaries() was as a result of the desire to quickly find a toy dataset enabling us to progress with our research. We trust the reviewer can appreciate that this choice was practically oriented and has little bearing on the content of our submission. We chose ICLR as the best option to submit this research based on the idea that the LR in the title of the conference (Learning Representations) would perfectly match the spirit of our work: investigating the properties of a 1D convolutional neural network to learn an invariant representation of intrinsic properties of a curve undergoing transformations.  \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning Invariant Representations Of Planar Curves ", "abstract": "We propose a metric learning framework for the construction of invariant geometric\nfunctions of planar curves for the Euclidean and Similarity group of transformations.\nWe leverage on the representational power of convolutional neural\nnetworks to compute these geometric quantities.

Below are the responses to the issues you raised.\n\n(1.) As you rightly pointed out, the number of points in the curve is not a limitation. In fact our goal was to ensure that we train for the invariant which is robust to sampling issues of the curve and the experiment in Figure 9 demonstrates this. The red points were chosen arbitrarily.  \n\n(2.) Our experience has shown that the method produces results which are stable to small deformations of the input curves but we do not provide a study of this direction yet as it requires a more comprehensive investigation which we are currently undertaking. In fact our current work can be seen as the foundation for providing a basis to exploring the method when applied to families of affine and other more complex deformations, both small and large. For these cases the inherent differential geometry is entirely different. The reason for this is that, for example, affine deformations are associated with \"affine curvatures\" which are different from euclidian curvature (both are local geometric functions of the same curve, but invariant to different types of transformations). \n\n(3.) We chose not to use circular convolution so that the network would compute the invariant specifically for open curves therefore not be constrained to input closed contours. This makes sense when one considers that we are more interested in the local structure of a curve than its global structure. This locality is an advantage  as we can then use the invariants to process even partial shapes (effects of occlusion and partiality). Unfortunately enforcing locality also means that the signature does depend on the first point. However, as demonstrated in the shape retrieval experiment in Figure 8, Section 5, this is mitigated by using shape distances like the symmetric Hausdorff distance which are independent of the starting point of the curve. \n\n(4.) Thank you for bringing our attention to this. This is in fact an error in the code we used to generate the graph and we have submitted an updated version.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Learning Invariant Representations Of Planar Curves ", "abstract": "We propose a metric learning framework for the construction of invariant geometric\nfunctions of planar curves for the Euclidean and Similarity group of transformations.\nWe leverage on the representational power of convolutional neural\nnetworks to compute these geometric quantities.
