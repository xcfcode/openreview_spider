This method is a combination of the online variational inference for streaming environment with Monte Carlo method. The authors further propose to maintain a coreset which consists of representative data points from the past tasks. Such a coreset is used for the main aim of avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning. Extensive experiments shows that VCL performs very well, compared with some state-of-the-art methods. \n\nThe authors present two ideas for continual learning in this paper: (1) Combination of online variational inference and sampling method, (2) Use of coreset to deal with the catastrophic forgetting problem. Both ideas have been investigated in Bayesian literature, while (2) has been recently investigated in continual learning. Therefore, the authors seems to be the first to investigate the effectiveness of (1) for continual learning. From extensive experiments, the authors find that the first idea results in VCL which can outperform other state-of-the-art approaches, while the second idea plays little role. \n\nThe finding of the effectiveness of idea (1) seems to be significant. The authors did a good job when providing a clear presentation, a detailed analysis about related work, an employment to deep discriminative models and deep generative models, and a thorough investigation of empirical performance.\n\nThere are some concerns the authors should consider:\n- Since the coreset plays little role in the superior performance of VCL, it might be better if the authors rephrase the title of the paper. When the coreset is empty, VCL turns out to be online variational inference [Broderich et al., 2013; Ghahramani & Attias, 2000]. Their finding of the effectiveness of online variational inference for continual learning should be reflected in the writing of the paper as well.\n- It is unclear about the sensitivity of VCL with respect to the size of the coreset. The authors should investigate this aspect.\n- What is the trade-off when the size of the coreset increases?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Continual Learning", "abstract": "This paper develops variational continual learning (VCL), a simple but general framework for continual learning that fuses online variational inference (VI) and recent advances in Monte Carlo VI for neural networks.

In the updated version of the paper, we have added an additional Split notMNIST experiment (see page 7 of the new version and Figure 5). The notMNIST dataset is much larger and more noisy than the MNIST dataset. It contains 400,000 images of 10 characters written in different font styles, where each character has 40,000 images. This dataset is considered more difficult than the MNIST dataset. In this new experiment, we investigate a deeper network with 4 hidden layers and our method also performs well compared to EWC and SI.\n\nExtension to computer vision applications:\n\nThe paper shows that VCL performs very well for MLPs in a variety of settings which we believe is an important contribution. To apply our method to many large-scale computer vision applications, the method needs to be extended to handle CNNs. In general, accurate approximate variational inference methods have not been developed for CNNs and this is an outstanding goal of the area of Bayesian Deep Learning. We therefore leave this development for future research. However, once a good general variational inference method has been developed for CNNs, it will be straightforward to apply the VCL framework.\n\nAlthough MC dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) is one candidate for Bayesian inference in CNNs, the nature of this approximation makes vanilla application of the VCL framework difficult. MC dropout uses a Gaussian prior over the weights and (the limit of) a mixture of Gaussians with shared parameters for the variational distribution. These two distributions are not of the same form and therefore a second approximation step would be required to apply VCL. Moreover, the impoverished representation of posterior uncertainty retained by MC dropout is likely to result in poor continual learning performance since nuanced and parameter specific information about parameter uncertainty is required in this setting. Approximations that employ a single global variance parameter in the q distribution, such as those employed by Kingma et al., 2015, will suffer similar problems.\n\nReferences:\n\nY. Gal and Z.

We have added a more comprehensive comparison to the updated version of the paper to make this completely clear (see Figure 3 and the last paragraph on page 6). For example, on the permuted MNIST task when the coreset size is 200 examples per task, the final accuracy of VCL improves from 90% to 93% and when the coreset size is increased to 5,000 examples per task, the performance further improves to 95.5%. These are significant improvements for this dataset. Crucially, using just the coreset alone (and no online inference) still performs significantly worse. Thus, although we agree that VCL alone is effective for continual learning the combination with a coreset can be critical. \n\nMoreover, as now noted in the paper, from a more general perspective, coreset VCL is equivalent to a message-passing implementation of variational inference in which the coreset data point message updates are scheduled last, only after the contributions from other data have been incorporated. This opens the door to versions of VCL which revisit the coreset points several times through learning (rather than just at the end).\n\nNovelty of VCL and contributions of the paper:\n\nThe novelty of our VCL method compared to online variational inference (Broderich et al., 2013; Ghahramani & Attias, 2000) is two-fold. \n\nFirst, online VI has only previously been applied to simple conjugate models. Here instead we consider deep neural networks and variational auto-encoders. Indeed, a Bayesian treatment of the parameters of variational auto-encoders, in addition to the latent variables, is challenging in and of itself. These more complex models require a fusion of online VI and Monte Carlo VI which is technically challenging. \n\nSecond, previous work on online VI considers very simple tasks, most typically where the data arrive in iid fashion. Here instead, we consider much more general continual learning tasks that were not previously considered for online VI. The increased inhomogeneity in the data necessitated the development of coreset VI which is more natural and simpler than previous work on coresets for continual learning such as Lopez-Paz and Ranzato (2017) which requires an additional constraint on the optimization objective for every new task.\n\nAt a more general level, we also feel that it is important to point out to the continual learning community that standard methods of (approximate) Bayesian inference provide a rich mathematical and algorithmic framework for attacking continual learning that has hitherto been largely overlooked.\n\nAppropriateness of the Title:\n\nGiven the two points addressed in the above responses, we believe that the title is appropriate. We have endeavoured to explain the relationship to prior work in the first line of the abstract, \u201ca simple but general framework for continual learning that fuses online variational inference (VI) and recent advances in Monte Carlo VI for neural networks\u201d, which we hope clearly explains the positioning of the paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational Continual Learning", "abstract": "This paper develops variational continual learning (VCL), a simple but general framework for continual learning that fuses online variational inference (VI) and recent advances in Monte Carlo VI for neural networks.

In this new experiment, we investigate a deeper network and show that VCL still performs well compared to EWC and SI.\n\nDeployment on tasks requiring CNNs:\n\nThe application of VCL to the Atari or Split CIFAR tasks is also a sensible suggestion. However, this requires the development of reliable variational inference methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is still an outstanding research goal of Bayesian Deep Learning and so we leave this for future research.
