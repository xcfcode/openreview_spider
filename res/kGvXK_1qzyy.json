However, we disagree with almost all of the reasons that accompanied the decision, and given the open review nature of ICLR, we felt we need to respond to the decision which we further do not feel is supported by the reviews.\n\n1. A technical note first - \"two of the reviewers increased their scores by a point\" - in fact 3 reviewers increased their scores, one of them by 2 points.\n\n2. \"is not novel\" - while the novelty and relation to the literature were not clearly explained in the original submission, this issue was thoroughly addressed during the rebuttal phase.\nAfter the revision, the relevant references to this issue were \"The proofs seem to be based on standard techniques\" (Reviewer1); \"significantly improved... including discussing some relevant work\" (R3); and \"Thanks to the authors for the detailed response and extended discussion on theoretical results\" (R4).\nFurthermore, we did demonstrate that the naive mean test is the one that is actually used in practice (see for example the sequential tests paragraph in related work section), and not any multivariate-based test.\n\n3. \"assumption of normality\" - we actually do prove that our test is more powerful WITHOUT normality assumption (Theorem 4.2). None of the reviewers raised this issue. In fact, Reviewer4 positively pointed out the very general settings, \"such as considering non-Gaussian distributions\".\n\n4. \"results... not indicate an advantage\" - honestly, we find it difficult to look at the results and think that the different methods are comparable. MDT (which we point out is the most robust version of our test) is considerably better than Mean in 10(!) out of 11 scenarios (where Mean either entirely fails to detect OR has very major detection delay), and both yield similar results in the 11'th scenario. Hotelling also loses to MDT significantly in 8 out of 11 scenarios, and yields similar results in the other 3 scenarios (note that H0 scenario is not to be counted).\n\nThis is all shown clearly in Figure 4. The display might be somewhat compressed and we would consider changing it to something cleaner, but the issue of \"non-convincing results\" has never been raised during the whole reviewing process.\n\n5. \"mean change problem... seems to be too stylized to be effective\" - the focus of the test is a fair point for debating (though we wouldn't call a mean-test for degradation \"stylized\"). However, considering the empirical results, we find it hard to refer to the suggested test as \"ineffective\u201d.\n\nSincerely,\nThe authors"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1161/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1161/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Drift Detection in Episodic Data: Detect When Your Agent Starts Faltering", "authorids": ["~Ido_Greenberg1", "~Shie_Mannor2"], "authors": ["Ido Greenberg", "Shie Mannor"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning reliability", "Reinforcement learning stability", "Drift detection", "Degradation test", "Bootstrapping"], "abstract": "Detection of deterioration of agent performance in dynamic environments is challenging due to the non-i.i.d nature of the observed performance.

However, in my opinion, from the reviewers' and authors' remarks and from my own reading of the paper, there are concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be publication worthy. Primary among these is the quantum of novelty -- as many reviews point out, the key idea of viewing an episodic trajectory as a multivariate (vector) sample for running hypothesis tests is not novel in itself, as is the claim that new tests have been devised. Another crucial issue is the (parametric) assumption of normality for the episodic reward sequence which is not adequately justified in the paper -- even a two time-step trajectory with normal rewards per state transition can exhibit a mixture-of-Gaussians type reward distribution for the second state, breaking the assumption. As it transpired from the reviews of Reviewer4, reducing environment shift/degradation to just a mean change problem, without even considering a change in the variances (2nd order statistics), seems to be too stylized to be effective. There are other, nonparametric approaches in statistics based on testing for changes in the distribution function (kernel density estimation approaches, for instance), which could perhaps be applied without normality assumptions and yield favourable results. The experimental results for detection delay often show significant overlaps of the delay distributions for different procedures (e.g., Hotelling vs. Mean vs. UDT etc.), which does not indicate an advantage of the proposed method. \n\nI would urge the author(s) to assimilate the feedback and delve deeper as to why and how parametric procedures based on normality assumptions may or may not succeed, so as to significantly strengthen the theoretical and practical message of this work.

It seems that the paper mainly deal with per-step reward without considering state and action information when detecting changes. \nSome related work that also applies hypothesis testing procedure for non-stationary MDPs might worth mentioning.

It is assumed that the pre-change (nominal) mean and covariance of each episodic is perfectly known or can be accurately estimated from reference data. The Uniform Degradation Test (UDT) and Partial Degradation Test (PDT) are proposed to detect the mean shift. Moreover, this paper uses bootstrap to control the false alarm rate by setting the threshold as empirical quantiles of the detection statistic computed from reference data. \n\nOverall, this paper is well written and well-structured. The most impressive part is that they include comprehensive details, covering almost every related aspect. And this paper has tried to make the problem as general as possible, such as considering non-Gaussian distributions, etc.\n\nHowever, the technical contribution is very incremental. And the problem itself, although is proposed in the reinforcement learning setting, is of no fundamental difference with the classical mean shift in change-point detection literature, for example, change-point detection for a mean shift in multivariate Gaussian distributions. And I didn't see the classical Hotelling T^2 test mentioned in this paper, which is a classical and also widely-used method to detect the change in mean/covariance, and it also utilizes the pre-change covariance matrix in the detection statistic. Moreover, the proposed Uniform Degradation Test methods are a direct consequence of the likelihood ratio test; the false alarm control by bootstrap is also widely used in change-point detection literature for problems where the theoretical characterization of false alarm rate (or average run length) is difficult to obtain. \n\nLooking forward, I think this paper may be improved by expanding the horizon of the problem set-up and possibly leading to new theoretical findings. \n\n================ After the author response, I raise my score by 1 ================\nThanks to the authors for the detailed response and extended discussion on theoretical results and experiments, and I have raised my score by 1.

Not even the main theorem proof are included (the sketches are not useful in understanding the proof line) and the experimental setting is described in details only in the additional material.

The authors state in some places of the text that their method can be applied in statistic domain other than RL. However, for me, the entire proposed methodology does not relate to RL and is more general: it can be applied to any sequential statistics (series of random variables) that have a proper [auto]correlation structure (just see how the main statements). Due to this, I have concerns in the way how these proposed approaches are presented: I believe that a paper requires a notable refactoring to improve the presentation.\n\n\n2. Seem that the contribution is not enough for the current venue.  All the proposed statements (Theorem 4.1, Theorem 4.2) looks very straightforward. Possibly, there untrivial tricks in their proofs, but the current proofs (proof sketch) does not reflect them at all (see). I expect a clearer presentation in the main text why these results are non-trivial and non-incremental. As for now, the provided theoretical grounds looks as non-enough for publication @ ICLR.\n\n\n\nOther issues:\nPaper cites the paper\n [Vineet Abhishek and Shie Mannor.

While being important and useful, this test differs from ours and is *not optimal* for the problem as defined in the paper. Indeed, as shown in the updated results (on the same scenarios as before), our statistic seems to do better than Hotelling.\n\nRegarding our contribution wrt change-point detection in general, we believe that we introduce several important contributions as described below, and we added several corresponding clarifications in sections 1,4,5,7, including additional results (that were previously mentioned only by title) in Section 4. Also see the description below for more details.\n\nWe would like to know the reviewer's opinion regarding the modifications.\n\n________________________  \nChangepoint detection is a broad domain with many approaches relevant for different frameworks, some of them we referred to, and certain others we intend to add (e.g. Kuncheva, Ludmila I., 2011). Many methods are not derived as optimal wrt concrete hypotheses. We suggest a specific model that in part looks at a univariate temporal signal as multivariate. We form two different hypotheses that we believe that reflect the nature of the relevant practical problem in RL. We use LR on two different hypotheses to derive a specific test which is very simple to use and yet optimal. Each of the two hypotheses is complex wrt a different parameter space, which complicates the proof as now explained in Section 4. We also prove under minimal assumptions (no normality) our advantage over the common approach of taking data blocks as single points (see for example (Colas et al., 2019), (Ditzler et al., 2015)), and quantify this advantage in terms of Sigma's spectrum. We made efforts to clarify all these points in the updated revision.\nWe could not find a straightforward optimal statistical test that handles these issues, and we would be grateful if the reviewer could refer us to relevant works.\n\nThe suggested bootstrap mechanism is unique in that it can handle non-iid samples. One may say that the innovation is in representing the univariate temporal episodic signal as multivariate, rather than in the algorithm itself. However, (1) the temporal dimension does have meaning when testing in the middle of an episode; (2) in either case we are not aware to such application of bootstrap to non-iid univariate signals in general and rewards in particular. These two points are now discussed in sections 5,7.\n\nOur work combines several contributions regarding how we look at the problem (focus on rewards that require minimal knowledge & modeling, converting temporal univariate into multivariate, defining two alternative hypotheses); theoretical results (as mentioned above); and practical results (major improvement over common practices, robust way to incorporate with existing methods, bootstrap of non-iid temporal signal). While part of these contributions are arguably \"incremental\", we believe that as a whole we introduce a novel, important and nontrivial approach to the problem of performance degradation in episodic framework."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1161/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1161/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Drift Detection in Episodic Data: Detect When Your Agent Starts Faltering", "authorids": ["~Ido_Greenberg1", "~Shie_Mannor2"], "authors": ["Ido Greenberg", "Shie Mannor"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement learning reliability", "Reinforcement learning stability", "Drift detection", "Degradation test", "Bootstrapping"], "abstract": "Detection of deterioration of agent performance in dynamic environments is challenging due to the non-i.i.d nature of the observed performance.

Indeed, certain clarifications were missing in the text.\n\nBy calling our approach \"model-free\", we mean that we refer to the world as an episodic process that generates rewards with certain joint-distribution - with no further assumptions (certain part of the analysis also assumes normality of that distribution).\nIn particular, we avoid 3 assumptions that are highly problematic in real-world applications: (1) fully-observable states; (2) Markov (memoryless transitions); (3) known transitions mechanism.

Many real-world applications require monitoring without intervention. If an FDA-approved insulin-injecting device fails to balance glucose levels, you don't explore alternative policies - you find out as soon as possible and hurries to the doctor(/engineer). Furthermore, it is a common practice to have a separation between control & safety modules, so you may not even have access to the acting policy. In addition, most ways of intervention in the policy would require further assumptions regarding the process and the policy, which would reduce the scope of validity of the method.

Our detection method is entirely external to the agent, and in particular does not require model-based learning. Furthermore, it can be applied to detect changes or drifts in any episodic signal.", "one-sentence_summary": "Optimal test for change detection in non-i.i.d settings, with applications to identifying deterioration in agent performance in episodic RL.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "greenberg|drift_detection_in_episodic_data_detect_when_your_agent_starts_faltering", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7523d8eb17e6c41c73c77640cf4c13171a8658c3.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/15fba0768a2d3cad608e40bfafc17e383b6c5b54.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=InNnaBJ3OZ", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ngreenberg2021drift,\ntitle={Drift Detection in Episodic Data: Detect When Your Agent Starts Faltering},\nauthor={Ido Greenberg and Shie Mannor},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=kGvXK_1qzyy}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
