Results are presented on a few ATARI games. Reviewers unanimously vote for rejecting the papers. R1, R3 give a score of 5, whereas R4, R5 give a score of 4. Their concerns are best explained in their own words: \n\nR1 says, \"The use of attention maps to analyze and explain deep neural networks is not new in itself, and learning attention maps to improve vision tasks is not new either.\"\n\nR3 says, \"the analysis of the learned attention masks seems selective. Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property.\"\n\nR5 says, \"I am still not convinced by the quality of the provided visual explanations nor am I convinced that the attention is well correlated with the current frame (the additional experiments provided do help somewhat in this regard, but are not extensive and reasonably inconclusive\"\n\nIn their rebuttal, to address R1's concern authors suggested that the use of attention on both value and policy networks is novel. This is not sufficient, because it does not show why such attention maps are more useful than ones proposed by prior work. As suggested by reviewers, a systematic study or a human study clearly showing that the proposed method adds more interpretability is critical. However, this is missing.  In response to R3, the authors provided experiments on more games. But this is not the point -- because it's not about the number of environments in which experiments are provided, but rather the nature of the analysis that is performed. Finally, R5 comments that it's unclear whether attention actually provided interpretability or not. \n\nDue to the lack of convincing analysis that demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of decisions made by RL agents, I recommend that the paper be rejected.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Explanation using Attention Mechanism in Actor-Critic-based Deep Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Hidenori_Itaya1", "~Tsubasa_Hirakawa1", "~Takayoshi_Yamashita1", "~Hironobu_Fujiyoshi2", "~Komei_Sugiura1"], "authors": ["Hidenori Itaya", "Tsubasa Hirakawa", "Takayoshi Yamashita", "Hironobu Fujiyoshi", "Komei Sugiura"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has great potential for acquiring the optimal action in complex environments such as games and robot control.

Human studies to verify that the explains actually help the humans understand (or predict) the agent's decision would be very helpful in this regard.\n    - I am uncertain that the contribution is enough to warrant publication at ICLR.  While this is the first work I am aware of to apply this type of visual explanation to RL, using attention masks is well known in the literature (Mascharka et al, 2018; Fukui et al, 2019) and it doesn't appear like any considerable modification necessary to apply it to this domain.\n    - Using the attention masks to to interpret the decision of the agent based on just the current frame is misleading.  This is because the attention is conditioned on s_t, not o_t, where s_t the output of ConvLSTM(o_t, s_{t-1}).  The consequence is that we do not know whether attention is high for a given location because of the visual information in o_t or the visual information in any other observation. While it is entirely plausible that the most influential location in the ConvLSTM output is most correlated with the current frame, this hasn't been shown.\n- Suggestions\n    - Show both the frame and the frame with attention in Figure 2.  Currently it can be hard see the content of the frame.\n- Overall\n    - Overall, I am not convinced the contribution is enough for publication at ICRL.  More importantly, without additional verification the attention masks cannot be used to explain the decision based on the current frame as they are conditioned on the current frame __and__ all previous frames.  \n- References\n    - Mascharka et al, 2018: Transparency by Design: Closing the Gap Between Performance and Interpretability in Visual Reasoning\n    - Fukui et al, 2019: Attention Branch Network: Learning of Attention Mechanism for Visual Explanation\n\n\n## Post Rebuttal\n\nI have increased my rating slightly but still don't think the paper is ready for publication.

We confirmed the influence of RNN on the attention map by visualizing the attention map for new states that do not exist during training.\n\nFigures 19 and 20 show the changes in the attention map (policy and state value) produced by the environment with an additional object (e.g. fish, oxygen gauge) injected into the image. Figure 19 shows the transition of the attention map before and after adding fish artificially. From Figure 19, we can see from attention maps of policy that attention occurs the added fish in all frames. The agent attacks the fish and then faces the opposite direction to the fish. Then, the agent attacks the fish again by observing that the fish was not defeated. This is similar to the results of Mott et al. and shows that the agent responds to the current state and behaves appropriately.\n\nOn the other hand,  from Figure 18, we see that attention maps of value in Seaquest differs from attention maps of policy, and the attention maps of value focus on the oxygen gauge in addition to the fish and the agent. Figure 20 shows the transition of the attention map in a frame with low oxygen content, where the agent is artificially replaced by an oxygen gauge with full oxygen content before replenishing it. From Figure 20, we can see that the attention on the oxygen gauge is gradually observed from frame 3, where an oxygen gauge is added. We also see that the agent\u2019s behavior rises in frames 1 to 4 and falls in frames 5 and 6. Unlike attention maps of policy,  attention map of value reflected not immediately after the addition of the oxygen gauge, but a few frames later.

It is not a new concept that implementing an attention mechanism in a deep neural network to make it explainable. Applying attention mechanisms to augment the RL agent is also studied in previous work.\n\nFirst, we appreciate to advise the related paper. We have added the description about [A, B] in Section 2.2.\n\nIn deep RL, a strategy is an important clue to solve given task and environment. From the viewpoint of the strategy, the state value of actor-critic based model plays a crucial role because the state value is the expected value from current to future states and affects for the future action selections. However, the existing methods outputs attention maps with respect to the instantaneous action selection. Our method based on an actor-critic outputs two attention maps from both policy and value branches. Considering both attention maps, we can understand the basis of an agent's decision-making in more detail.\n\n> The method is only evaluated in three environments. It is necessary to validate it in various environments, especially showing the results in 3D environments (visual navigation, robot arm manipulation). It would be nice to report and discuss the failure cases in the experiments, instead of only the success cases.\n\nWe have added additional experiments on another environments (BeamRider, Fishing Derby, Seaquest).

The responses to these comments are provided below and we will update our manuscript that reflects these comments.\n\n\n> How were the points/frames in figure 2 chosen?\n\nWe selected frames from the scene that an agent\u2019s action highly affects with the environment, e.g., the scene where the agent sends a ball back in Breakout. And the neighboring frames are selected as frames 1 and 3. For points, we selected points considering state values from the opening and ending of each game stage. The reason is that the state value is the expected value from current to future states, which contributes the task scene. (Note that the mask-attention in state value is moved to Figure 3 in the revised manuscript.)\n\n> I am uncertain that the contribution is enough to warrant publication at ICLR. While this is the first work I am aware of to apply this type of visual explanation to RL, using attention masks is well known in the literature and it doesn't appear like any considerable modification necessary to apply it to this domain. \n\nIn deep RL, a strategy is an important clue to solve given task and environment.

For example, deep Q-network-based approaches input several frames into a network and deep RL methods introducing recurrent layer have been proposed including our method.

The responses to these comments are provided below and we will update our manuscript that reflects these comments.\n\n> The issue of including attention in RL is not completely unresearched. In particular, it would be valuable to discuss [A] as the claims and purported aims are similar. The discussion of the type of attention that could be applied (eg, map vs spotlight, soft vs hard) is missing in the article as only one model of attention is evaluated.\n\nWe appreciate to advise the related paper. Mott et al. [A] also focused on the attention of an actor-critic model. However, their method compute attention maps before policy and value branches. In contrast, our method provides on visual explanations related to policy and attention values as attention maps, respectively. We have added the description about [A] in Section 2.2.\n\n> More importantly, the novelty of the article is not clearly argued: The use of attention maps to analyse and explain deep neural networks is not new in itself, and learning attention maps to improve vision tasks is not new either.\n\nOur contribution relies on that we focused on the policy and value output in a actor-critic method. Analysis and training of DNNs with an attention map have been studied and deep RL models introducing attention have also been proposed. These attention-based deep RL models outputs an attention map from a network model. As we mentioned above, in fact, [A] also output a single attention even though they used actor-critic-based model. Meanwhile, our method provides attention maps with respect to both policy and state values. Therefore, the proposed improve the explainability of deep RL model.\n\n> I think the use of the term \"explanation\" is a bit misleading in this article: the proposed approach provides activation maps, which offer some hints at the system's process, but still require a large amount of human interpretation for an actual explanation.\n\nIn this paper, we use the term \u201cvisual explanation\u201d as with some existing works (e.g., [B]). \u201cVisual explanation\u201d visualize where a deep RL model focuses on as attention maps and use them for analyzing the decision-making of the agent.\n\n> I did not understand the author's argument of why using bottom-up saliency requires back-propagation.\n\nWe are sorry for the insufficient description. Obviously, not every bottom-up saliencies require back-propagation. The studies [B, C] generate bottom-up saliencies using gradient information computed from network output and target value to train a network. Therefore, those approaches requires back-propagation computation. Meanwhile, [D] is the bottom-up saliency without backprop. that computes the saliency from feature maps obtained from convolutional layer. We will update the part of bottom-up saliency clearly. We have corrected the desceriptions about bottom-up and top-down approaches in Section 1.  \n\nReferences  \n[A] A.

Specifically, they applied a mask-attention mechanism for the policy and value prediction neural network columns of the A3C model based on the convolutional LSTM (Xingjian et al., 2015). They evaluated the proposed attention mechanism on three selected ATARI games (namely, Breakout, SpaceInvader, and Ms.Pacman) and show that the attention mechanism generates intuitive visual attention in decision-making. They also compared the attention's impact on game scores against some ablative attention mechanism variants.  \n\n\nPros and Cons:\n\n++ The paper contributes to transparent decision making of reinforcement learning methods by figuring out attended regions in the observational space (pixels). The identified attention regions are intuitive and action-conditional. The cases discussed in the three selected ATARI games are informative.\n\n-- The analysis of the learned attention masks seems selective. Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property. Current analyses on very sparse time indexes of three selected ATARI games may not provide sufficient evidence or insights to support claims.  Some additional experimental studies on other games or similar domains with high-dimension perceptions would strengthen the paper's contributions. \n\n-- The paper briefly mentions other attention mechanisms for reinforcement learning methods. It seems that some in-depth discussions on the relationship between the proposed approach and the prior art are needed. How is the proposed attention mechanism different from previous ones? Does it address some limitations of previous methods, such as capturing more action-conditional information or more robust to initialization conditions? An additional empirical comparison would also be informative. \n\n-- The motivation and goal on the inverting gaze area are less clear.

The empirical results in Atari 2600 show that the performance of A3C is further improved by implementing mask attention on the actor and critic network separately.\n\nStrength: \n- The paper is well-written and easy-to-follow.\n- The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in three Atari environments.\n- The comparison of the score by the inverting gaze area is interesting.\n\nWeakness:\n- The contribution is marginal. The idea is straightforward. It is not a new concept that implementing an attention mechanism in a deep neural network to make it explainable. Applying attention mechanisms to augment the RL agent is also studied in previous work[1, 2, 3]. This key idea of this paper is similar to them, inserting the attention mechanism into the network to explain the RL policy in a top-down fashion. The difference is in the implementation details of the mask-A3C, e.g. using ConvLSTM in the state encoder to keep the spatial information and applying different attention mechanisms for the actor and critic. It is necessary to further discuss and compare these works in the paper. \n- The method is only evaluated in three environments. It is necessary to validate it in various environments, especially showing the results in 3D environments (visual navigation, robot arm manipulation). It would be nice to report and discuss the failure cases in the experiments, instead of only the success cases.\n\nRef:\n\n[1] Mott, Alexander, et al. \"Towards interpretable reinforcement learning using attention augmented agents.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2019.\n\n[2] Manchin, Anthony, Ehsan Abbasnejad, and Anton van den Hengel. \"Reinforcement learning with attention that works: A self-supervised approach.\" International Conference on Neural Information Processing.
