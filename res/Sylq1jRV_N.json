The authors formulate local temporal constraints using entropy with a sliding window over a policy. Global, state-based constraints are determined using expert policy features from imitation learning and a visual autoencoder representation. The authors validate their approach on two VizDoom tasks, Pickup and Maze, treating specific actions as different sub-tasks.\n\n+ Shows clear comparison with ablations of different constraints. \n- The problem could be better motivated. There seems to be a gap between the initial problem, sequential decision making, and the approach of constrained clustering. It is not obvious what the \u201clabeling and sample generation requirements\u201d are. \n- How will sub-tasks be used in the downstream decision-making? Along those lines, is there an empirical way to measure the downstream efficacy of this approach?\n- The formulation of the problem was hard to follow. How can the constraints be used to make decisions? Can you clarify the difference between ground truth labels of sub-tasks and different ground truth constraints?\n- \u201c... learns from limited (or no) labeled data by generating weak constraints that do not require sub-task labels or access to a simulator for evaluation.\u201d Is there a trade-off study for none to some limited labels?\n\nWhile the paper\u2019s motivation appears suggests a no/limited-label approach, it is not evident how the clustering approach is effective for the downstream task.", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper36/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper36/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sub-Task Discovery with Limited Supervision: A Constrained Clustering Approach", "authors": ["Phillip Odom", "Aaron Keech", "Zsolt Kira"], "authorids": ["phodom@gatech.edu", "aaron.keech@gtri.gatech.edu", "zkira@gatech.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning captures sub-task information to learn modular policies that can be quickly adapted to new tasks.
