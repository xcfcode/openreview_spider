We respond to the questions and issues raised in the review below.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Section 3.3 clearly defines the explicit form of the algorithm (where data and labels are essentially pre-processed via a copula transform), details regarding the \u201cimplicit form\u201d are very scarce. From Section 3.4, it seems as though the authors are optimizing the form of the gaussian information bottleneck I(x,t), in the hopes of recovering an encoder $f_\\beta(x)$ which gaussianizes the input (thus emulating the explicit transform) ? Could the authors clarify whether this interpretation is correct, or alternatively provide additional clarifying details?\n\nThis seems to be a misunderstanding. The $f_\\beta$ transformation stands for an abstract, general transformation of the input data. In our model, it is implemented by the copula transformation (explicit or implicit) and the encoder network. $f_\\beta$ thus does not emulate the explicit transformation, and is not confined to representing the (implicit or explicit) copula transformation. The copula transformation, not necessarily implemented as a neural network, is a part of $f_\\beta$.\nThe purpose of introducing $f_\\beta$ is to explain the difference of the model with and without the extra copula transformation and why applying the transformation translates to sparsity not observed in the \u201cregular\u201d sparse Gaussian information bottleneck.\nWe elaborate on the difference between the implicit and explicit copula in the answer to the last question.\n\n\n\n\nThere are also many missing details in the experimental section: how were the number of \u201cactive\u201d components selected ?\n\nThe only parameter of our model is $\\lambda$. As described in Section 3.4, by continuously increasing $\\lambda$, one decreases sparsity defined by the number of active neurons. Thus, one can adjust the number of active components by continuously varying $\\lambda$ (curves in Figures 2, 4, 6 with increasing numbers of active components correspond to increasing $\\lambda$).\nThe number of active components is chosen differently in different experiments. In Experiments 1, 6, 7 $\\lambda$, and thus the number of active components, is varied over a large interval. In Experiment 3, $\\lambda$ is also varied, and subsequently chosen so that the dimensionality of latent spaces in the two compared models is the same.\n\n\n\n\nWhich versions of the algorithm (explicit/implicit) were used for which experiments ? I believe explicit was used for Section 4.1, and implicit for 4.2 but again this needs to be spelled out more clearly\n\nAs we mentioned in the rebuttal, throughout the paper as well as for the experiments, the explicit copula transformation defined in Eq. (6) is used. The explicit transformation is also the default choice of the form of the copula transformation.\n\n\n\n\nI would also like to see a discussion (and perhaps experimental comparison) to standard preprocessing techniques, such as PCA-whitening.\n\nPCA whitening, in contrast to the copula transformation, does not disentangle marginal distributions from the dependence structure captured by the copula. It also does not restore the invariance properties of the model we identified as motivation. It does not lead to a boost in information curves such as in Figure 2; we can add the appropriate experiment to our manuscript.\n\n\n\n\nI do not think their [experiments\u2019] scope (single synthetic, plus a single UCI dataset) is sufficient. While the gap in performance is significant on the synthetic task, this gap appears to shrink significantly when moving to the UCI dataset. How does this method perform for more realistic data, even e.g. MNIST ? I think it is crucial to highlight that the deficiencies of DIB matter in practice, and are not simply a theoretical consideration.\n[\u2026]\nthe representation analyzed in Figure 7 is promising, but again the authors could have targeted other common datasets for disentangling, e.g. the simple sprites dataset used in the beta-VAE paper.\n\nWe would like to stress that imposing sparsity on the latent representation is an important aspect of our model. It is in general difficult to quantify latent representations. Our model yields significantly sparser representations even when the information curves are closer.\nOur model shows its full strength when a multiview analysis is involved, especially with data where multiple variables have different and rescaled distributions. Datasets constructed such that marginals (or simply labels, such as in the MNIST dataset) are uniform distributed do not pose enough challenge, since the output space is too easy to reconstruct even without the copula transformation.\nAs for dataset size, we would like to point out that finding meaningful sparse representations is more challenging for smaller datasets with higher dimensionality, therefore we think that the datasets we used do show the most relevant properties of the copula DIB.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Sparse Latent Representations with the Deep Copula Information Bottleneck", "abstract": "Deep latent variable models are powerful tools for representation learning.

The authors address this shortcoming by applying the DIB to a transformation of the data, obtained by a copula transform. This explicit approach is shown on synthetic experiments to preserve more information about the target, yield better reconstruction and converge faster than the baseline. The authors further develop a sparse extension to this Deep Copula Information Bottleneck (DCIB), which yields improved representations (in terms of disentangling and sparsity) on a UCI dataset.\n\n(significance) This is a promising idea. This paper builds on the information theoretic perspective of representation learning, and makes progress towards characterizing what makes for a good representation. Invariance to transforms of the marginal distributions is clearly a useful property, and the proposed method seems effective in this regard.\nUnfortunately, I do not believe the paper is ready for publication as it stands, as it suffers from lack of clarity and the experimentation is limited in scope.\n\n(clarity) While Section 3.3 clearly defines the explicit form of the algorithm (where data and labels are essentially pre-processed via a copula transform), details regarding the \u201cimplicit form\u201d are very scarce.

The authors suggest Gaussianify the data using copula transformation and  further adopt a diagonal determinant approximation with justification of minimizing an upper bound of mutual information.  Experiments include both artificial data and real data. \n\nThe paper is unclear at some places and writing gets confusing. For example, it is unclear whether and when explicit or implicit transforms are used for x and y in the experiments, and the discussion at the end of Section 3.3 also sounds confusing. It would be more helpful if the author can make those points more clear and offer some guidance about the choices between explicit and implicit transform in practice. Moreover, what is the form of f_beta and how beta is optimized?  In the first equation on page 5, is tilde y involved? How to choose lambda?\n\nIf MI is invariant to monotone transformations and information curves are determined by MIs, why \u201ctransformations basically makes information curve arbitrary\u201d? Can you elaborate?  \n\nAlthough the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach with copula transformation yields higher information curves, more compact representation and better reconstruction quality, it would be more significant if the author can show whether these would necessarily lead to any improvements on other goals such as classification accuracy or robustness under adversarial attacks. \n\nMinor comments: \n\n- What is the meaning of the dashed lines and the solid lines respectively in Figure 1? \n- Section 3.3 at the bottom of page 4: what is tilde t_j? and x in the second term? Is there a typo? \n- typo, find the \u201cmost orthogonal\u201d representation if the inputs -> of the inputs \n\nOverall, the main idea of this paper is interesting and well motivated and but the technical contribution seems incremental. The paper suffers from lack of clarity at several places and the experimental results are convincing but not strong enough. \n\n***************\nUpdates: \n***************\nThe authors have clarified some questions that I had and further demonstrated the benefits of copula transform with new experiments in the revised paper. The new results are quite informative and addressed some of the concerns raised by me and other reviewers. I have updated my score to 6 accordingly. \n\n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Sparse Latent Representations with the Deep Copula Information Bottleneck", "abstract": "Deep latent variable models are powerful tools for representation learning.
