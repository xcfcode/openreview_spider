During training they compute two forms of attention: (1) the standard soft-attention from a decoder fed with teacher forced output, and (2) the inference-time attention from a decoder fed with predicted outputs.  Their training objective consists of two terms: The first is the token-wise cross entropy loss but by conditioning on the predicted output  but with teacher-forced attention.  The second is a KL distance between the above two types of attention distributions.   Experiments with mechanical  turks indicate that their attention forcing mechanism is strongly preferred over the existing teacher forced output and attention model.  On translation their method provides little or no improvement.\n\nI am inclined towards rejecting the paper because the experiment and related work section still requires a lot of work before 1. The claimed utility of the idea is established, and 2. The novelty over the many existing attention architectures is established.   I elaborate on each of these next.\n\nRelated work: Recently, many papers have directly or indirectly handled the problem of exposure bias that this paper attempts to address.

[1,2] introduce alternative approaches based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). These RL-based approaches can be considered a type of minimum Bayes risk training, which is briefly discussed in section 2.2 of our paper. Compared with these approaches, attention forcing is expected to be more stable as the training reward is less sparse, and the model is trained in a mode between teacher forcing and free running. In addition,  attention forcing is more suitable for tasks where it is important for the predicted sequence to be well aligned with the reference sequence, such as TTS. [3,4,5] introduce methods to improve the attention mechanism by changing the model architecture. In contrast, attention forcing is a training method, and can be used in combination with the models introduced in [3,4,5].\n\nIn our preliminary experiments, we tried to use scheduled sampling with a linear decay schedule for both TTS and NMT, which did not result in noticeable performance gain. It is however not fair to compare scheduled sampling and attention forcing based on these results, as the former requires more hyper parameter tuning. The main reason why we did not compare with scheduled sampling or professor forcing in TTS is that most, if not all, state-of-the art TTS models are trained with teacher forcing. The seq2seq model used in our work is largely based on Tacotron1&2, which are to our knowledge among the best-performing models in TTS.\n\n[1] Sequence level training with recurrent neural networks; MA Ranzato, S Chopra, M Auli, W Zaremba, 2015\n[2] An actor-critic algorithm for sequence prediction; D Bahdanau, P Brakel, K Xu, A Goyal, R Lowe\n[3] Posterior Attention Models for Sequence to Sequence Learning; S Shankar, S Sarawagi - 2019\n[4] Latent Alignment and Variational Attention; Yuntian Deng, Yoon Kim, Justin Chiu, Demi Guo, Alexander M.

The basic idea is to approximate beam search during training and penalize the reference output falling off the beam. A major difference between this approach and our work is that this approach is designed for tasks where the output space is discrete, so that beam search can be used. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to whether the output space is continuous or discrete. In terms of regularizing the attention mechanism, [2,3,4] are similar to our work. Regularizing the attention mechanism can be considered a special case of hidden layer regularization, which is involved in professor forcing. In the context of attention forcing, these approaches can be considered alternative ways of obtaining reference attention. We propose to generate reference attention with a teacher forcing model, which can be trained simultaneously with the attention forcing model. [2,4] requires collecting reference attention maps, and [3] uses an SMT model to estimate them.\n\nFor attention forcing, there is still discrepancy between training and inference, because the reference attention is not available at inference stage. It would be desirable to eliminate this discrepancy (e.g. by training the model in free running mode), but this is likely to make training less stable.\n\nFor the TTS experiment, the test set contains 50 sentences. Although there were only 36 human evaluators, each of them listened to 5 of the test sentences. So in total 150 sentences are randomly drawn from the test set and evaluated. On average, each test sentence is evaluated 3 times.\n\n[1] Wiseman & Rush. Sequence-to-Sequence Learning as Beam-Search Optimization\n[2] Bao et al.

However, it should be noted that the time required remains the same, as the two models can be trained in parallel. In addition, if memory is an issue, the two models can be trained in a sequential fashion.\n\nThere are multiple ways of combining scheduled sampling with attention forcing. As attention forcing is in the middle of teacher forcing and free running, a schedule can be used to shift the training scheme gradually from teacher forcing to attention forcing, and then from attention forcing to free running. We hypothesize that using a schedule to gradually shift the training scheme would make the training more stable. In particular, for tasks (e.g. NMT) where the output space is discrete and the predicted output can be categorically wrong, the gradual shift can be essential. In contrast, it is expected to be less important for tasks (e.g. TTS) where the output space is continuous and errors in the predicted output are less serious.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1222/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1222/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Attention Forcing for Sequence-to-sequence Model Training", "authors": ["Qingyun Dou", "Yiting Lu", "Joshua Efiong", "Mark J.F.
