In particular, we delineate how this notion of encoding is different than other encoding algorithms commonly used in other disciplines such as computer vision and computer graphics. We also present a model comprised of multiple neural networks including a processor, a compressor and an evaluator. These parts each satisfy a particular requirement of our encoding. We compare our encoding model with the analogous models in the literature.", "pdf": "/pdf/541a533abae7268049e7ddcf00cc0e5fcae6714e.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|geometry_encoding_for_numerical_simulations", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021geometry,\ntitle={Geometry encoding for numerical simulations},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ONnNXBPg41h},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
