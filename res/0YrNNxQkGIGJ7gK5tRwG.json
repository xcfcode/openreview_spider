Entity representations derived in this way are then used as initialization vectors in the TransE model, that generalizes relationships between entities in a knowledge base. The resulting approach obtains competitive results, in particular on a WordNet-based benchmark.\n\nThe paper is generally clear, the approach is simple and elegant, and potentially very useful, since it might address the important issue of how to assign distributional representations to out-of-vocabulary words. At the same time, as the authors recognize, the approach is not novel. Indeed, they should cite references going much further back than Chen et al 2014--at the very least, Hinrich Schuetze's seminal 90s work.\n\nGiven that the crucial advantage of the proposed approach is to extend coverage of distributional models, I found it disappointing that the authors did not frame the evaluation in terms of coverage. They mention in the introduction that 50-80% of the entities in the benchmark are not in the word2vec and GloVe spaces. How does the proposed model perform on tuples involving these entities? How do they compare, with respect to these entities, to models that are initialized with plain word2vec/GloVe vectors, restricted to the in-vocabulary entities only? (with random initializations for the oov entities).\n\nMore generally, given that models directly initialized with corpus-trained w2v/GloVe vectors for the entities are the most obvious comparison points, results should have been reported for the latter also with GloVe, and also for WordNet. The latter comparison seems crucial, since WordNet is where the proposed model shines.\n\nMinor points:\n\nI would have liked a short description of TransD, to get a sense of how much simpler the proposed approach really is.\n\nAlso, the difference between the filtered and raw setups should be explained.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Initializing Entity Representations in Relational Models", "abstract": "Recent work in learning vector-space embeddings for multi-relational data has focused on combining relational information derived from knowledge bases with distributional information derived from large text corpora.
