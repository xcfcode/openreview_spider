They seemed quite alien to us until they emerged from the construction in Theorem 1.\n \nRegarding the performance of TCN on word- and char-level PTB, we have included these in the tables. They are much worse (by about 30 ppl on word-PTB and 0.14 bpc on char-PTB) than the prior SOTA results, despite the strong regularizations added to the original TCN. The significant improvement of TrellisNet over TCN is due to the ideas presented in our submission.\n \nConcerning the increase in computation time, the construction in Theorem 1 does produce deep networks with M + L \u2212 1 layers. However, in practice we do not have to use this precise number. As highlighted in Section 4.3 and Appendix B, existing techniques can help us quickly expand the horizon (i.e. context size) of a TrellisNet, for example by larger kernel sizes, dilations, or history repackaging. We investigate the problem of long-range modeling in Section 5.2 (Table 4) as well, where the temporal dependency in sequential MNIST, permuted MNIST and sequential CIFAR-10 is typically over 700 or 1000. In that case, it would be impossible to fit a TrellisNet with (M+L-1) layers on a GPU. Our experiments have shown that with the help of dilations and other techniques, TrellisNets can achieve very strong performance with a smaller number of layers than a strict interpretation of Theorem 1 would suggest.\n \nConcerning the dotted link in Figure 1a, we would like to offer two kinds of perspectives, one from the RNN side and one from the TCN side. In the context of an RNN, this is quite similar to what an LSTM or a GRU cell would do, where the gating mechanism would involve the hidden state or cell state (e.g., c_{t-1} in LSTM) propagated from the previous time step (see Figure 3(a) and 4). From a TCN perspective, this resembles a residual connection, except that we shift the connection by one time step in the temporal dimension of the input tensor. An interesting connection is that the introduction of cell state propagation in LSTMs was used to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, while residual connections have a similar effect and motivation in deep CNNs. The dotted connection in TrellisNet reflects both ideas.\n \nConcerning giving the full name of TCN and a brief introduction, we agree and have addressed this in the revision.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Trellis Networks for Sequence Modeling", "abstract": "We present trellis networks, a new architecture for sequence modeling.

The construction presented in our work has not been presented before and the details are quite interesting. For example, weight-tying across depth and input injection have not been used in TCNs for sequence modeling, and seemed quite strange to us until they emerged from the construction. These make sense in retrospect, but were not obvious a priori. Now that we have a better understanding of these architectural elements, they may see broader use in the community.\n \nSecond, about the techniques from both kinds of networks, we included a list of examples that TrellisNet can absorb from TCNs/RNNs in section B.1. While methods such as dilations and deep supervision are more common in ConvNets, we found the RNN-inspired techniques are equally important for a well-performing TrellisNet. For instance, the variational dropout that was specifically designed for RNN sequence models, gated activations motivated by LSTM/GRU, and history repackaging are all rarely seen in ConvNets. Besides the ablation study, we have now included more results from the generic TCN in section 5 in our latest revision. In all cases, the TrellisNet (which benefits from the above modifications) vastly outperform the generic TCN, even though the TCN is equipped with standard ConvNet ideas (e.g., dilation). We do believe that the inspiration from RNNs contributes a lot to improving TrellisNet beyond the TCN boundary.\n \nThird, regarding the modeling power of the full weight matrices. We introduced mixed group convolutions (Figure 2) to model the \u201clayers\u201d in RNNs. Once we generalize to a full weight matrix, there is no longer an interpretation in terms of \u201clayers\u201d. This can be seen in Eq. (6) and Figure 2(b): using a full convolutional kernel essentially mixes hidden units with different starting histories at each layer of the TrellisNet; this is impossible in RNNs. Theoretically, the full weight matrices can learn the blocked diagonal structure of Eq. (5) by gradient updates, if such diagonal structure is truly the optimal arrangement for sequence task parameters. In other words, optimal RNNs can be recovered by TrellisNet through training. However, as we showed in large-scale tasks such as WT103, TrellisNet gains quite a bit by using the full convolutional kernel (which mixes feature maps across all channels).\n \nRegarding the ablation study, we think the idea of input injection is very interesting indeed, and can now see broader use in light of our results. However, concerning the use of dense weight matrices, we believe this is quite significant as well. Note that we controlled for model capacity in the ablative analysis: when we replace full weight matrices with sparse ones we are actually using LSTMs with the same number of parameters, which were the SOTA on PTB. A >2 perplexity improvement is a large improvement at this level of performance: e.g., the ICLR 2018 oral paper [1] improved upon [2] by 2.8 units of perplexity via MoS, and [3] improved upon [2] by 0.5 perplexity via extensive hyperparameter search. As another datapoint, on WikiText-103, generalizing from sparse weight (LSTM) to full weight (TrellisNet) leads to a significant improvement by about 6 units of perplexity (we use the best LSTM results reported, which is [4]); i.e. by 16%.\n \n \n[1] Yang, Zhilin, et al. \"Breaking the softmax bottleneck: A high-rank RNN language model.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03953(2017).\n[2] Merity, Stephen, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. \"Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02182 (2017).\n[3] Melis, G\u00e1bor, Chris Dyer, and Phil Blunsom. \"On the state of the art of evaluation in neural language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.05589 (2017).\n[4] Rae, Jack W., et al. \"Fast Parametric Learning with Activation Memorization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.10049 (2018).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Trellis Networks for Sequence Modeling", "abstract": "We present trellis networks, a new architecture for sequence modeling.

The trellis network is in a sense a combination of RNNs and CNNs. The authors give a constructive proof that the trellis network is a special case of a truncated RNN. It also resembles CNNs since the neurons at higher levels have bigger receptive fields. As a result, techniques from RNN and CNN literature can be conveniently brought in and adapted to trellis network. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark tasks and shows performance gain over existing methods.\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. The experimental study is extensive. The reviewer believes that this paper will potentially inspire future research along this direction. However, the novelty of the proposed method compared to the TCN seems limited: only weight sharing and input injection. It would be great to include the performance of the TCN on the PTB dataset, on both word and character levels in Table 1 and 2.\n\nAccording to Theorem 1, to model an M-truncated L-layer RNN, a trellis network needs M + L \u2212 1 layers. When M is large, it seems that a trellis network needs to be deep. Although this does not increase to model size due to weight sharing, does it significantly increase computation time, both during training and inference?\n\nThe review might have missed it, but what is the rationale behind the dotted link in Figure 1a, or the dependence of the activation function $f$ on $z_t^{(i)}$? It seems that it is neither motivated by RNNs nor CNNs. From RNN's point of view, as shown in the proof of Theorem 1, $f$ only depends on its first argument. From CNN's point of view, the model still gets the same reception field without using $z_t^{(i)}$.\n\nMinor comments:\nThe authors might want to give the full name of TCN (temporal convolutional networks) and a short introduction in Section 2 or at the beginning of Section 4.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper438/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Trellis Networks for Sequence Modeling", "abstract": "We present trellis networks, a new architecture for sequence modeling. On the one hand, a trellis network is a temporal convolutional network with special structure, characterized by weight tying across depth and direct injection of the input into deep layers. On the other hand, we show that truncated recurrent networks are equivalent to trellis networks with special sparsity structure in their weight matrices. Thus trellis networks with general weight matrices generalize truncated recurrent networks. We leverage these connections to design high-performing trellis networks that absorb structural and algorithmic elements from both recurrent and convolutional models. Experiments demonstrate that trellis networks outperform the current state of the art methods on a variety of challenging benchmarks, including word-level language modeling and character-level language modeling tasks, and stress tests designed to evaluate long-term memory retention.
