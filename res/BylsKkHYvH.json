For instance, on Movielens 100K (AutoRec, item vector encoding), RMSE of vanilla zero imputation, LN, BN as follows: 0.8835 \u00b1 0.0003 (zero imputation w/o SN) vs. 0.9396 \u00b1 0.0141 (LN) vs. 0.9205 \u00b1 0.0081 (BN).

Without this assumption, we can't get such neat statements since we have to worry about some worst cases in our analysis, but this does not mean SN is ineffective even in theory; we can still see that SN can reduce the dependency on sparsity level to some extent, although in a much more complex form.

Comparison with other missing handling techniques]\n- First of all, the main contribution of our paper is to provide a deeper understanding and the corresponding solution about the issue that the zero imputation, the simplest and most intuitive way of handling missing data, degrades the performance in training neural networks. Hence, we only considered the vanilla zero imputation as our baseline in the submission since we do not claim that our corrected zero imputation (with SN) is the best for all tasks. \n\nHowever, some reviewers wanted to see direct comparisons against other state-of-the-art imputation techniques such as GAIN [1] and GMMC [2]. Hence, we performed additional comparisons against them on tasks considered in our paper as well as available tasks in [1] and [2].  Interestingly (and thanks to the reviewers who raised this issue), our corrected zero imputation (with SN), even with its simplicity, shows at least comparable or significantly better performances over all baselines, on all considered tasks.

Please refer to the answer to R1 or R3. \n\nThere is a minor note about the dropout method in the GMMC [2] paper you mentioned. The dropout method uses a single drop (missing) probability uniformly across all instances of the dataset. On the other hand, our algorithm normalizes each data instance with its own missing rate. The global drop probability does not solve the variable sparsity problem, so it shows poor performance as seen in Appendix H. For example, on Movielens 100K dataset (AutoRec with item vector encoding), the RMSE of dropout and SN is as follows: 0.9268 \u00b1 0.0261 (dropout) vs 0.8809 \u00b1 0.0011 (zero imputation w/ SN). For other various datasets and models, SN also shows similar or better performance compared to the dropout.\n\n[2] Marek \u0301Smieja, \u0141ukasz Struski, Jacek Tabor, Bartosz Zieli \u0301nski, and Przemys\u0142aw Spurek.

The authors proposed a sparsity normalization algorithm to process the input vectors to encounter the bias. In experiments, the authors evaluated the proposed sparsity normalization model on multiple datasets: collaborative filtering datasets, electric medical records datasets, single-cell RNA sequence datasets and UCI datasets. Results show that the proposed normalization method improves the prediction performance and the predicted values of the neural network is more uniformly distributed according to the number of missing entries.\n\nThe paper describes a clear and specific machine learning problem. Then the authors demonstrate a simple normalization strategy is capable of fixing the issue of biased prediction. The paper has a well-organized structure to convey the motivation. Therefore, my opinion on this paper leans to an acceptation. My questions are mainly on the experiment section:\n\n1) As shown in Table 2, there are various new collaborative filtering methods proposed after 2015, why the authors chose to extend AutoRec (Sedhain et al., 2015) but not other new methods?\n\n2) In the experiments, you compare your model with zero imputation (Please correct me if w/o SN is not zero imputation). However, I think it is a common practice in machine learning that we perform imputation with mean or median values. I'm interested in knowing whether filling with mean/median values work with these datasets.\n\n3) In section 4.5, you mentioned that \"SN is effective\neven when MCAR assumption is not established\". However, I'm still not clear about the reason. I believe many machine learning datasets have NMAR (not missing at random) type of missing data, but not MCAR. So this is an important issue for me.\n\n4) Does your model assume all input values are numerical but not categorical?

The authors demonstrate the existence of such phenomena empirically, analyze the root cause for it theoretically, and propose a simple yet effective normalization method to tackle the problem. Several experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.\n\nIn general I think the paper is descent and elegant. It is motivated from real-world pain-point, gives a rigorous study towards the root cause, and the proposed method is very effective. To the best of my knowledge there is no prior work looking deep into this area and this paper does bring new insights to the community. As a result I would vote for its acceptance.\n\nOne issue is that I find the backbone methods in experiments are somehow out-of-date. For example, AutoRec (2015) and CF-NADE (2016). I admit that I\u2019m not an expert in the field of recommendation but still think that more recent, and powerful baseline algorithms should be applied on to further demonstrate the true effectiveness of Sparsity Normalization.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1853/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1853/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["joonyoung.yi@kaist.ac.kr", "sehkmg@kaist.ac.kr", "preppie@yuhs.ac", "sjhwang82@kaist.ac.kr", "eunhoy@kaist.ac.kr"], "title": "Why Not to Use Zero Imputation?
