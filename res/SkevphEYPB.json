The authors provide an analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) showing that the convergence can be accelerated by lowering the gradient Lipschitz constant and gradient variances. Based on this observation, the authors show that by applying POP-norm which is quite similar to the Batch-norm applied before the activation functions, the gradient Lipschitz constants and the gradient variances can be lowered. \n\nI must first confess that I\u2019m not an expert in the relevant area. I\u2019m don\u2019t know why the reviewing system assigned this paper to me, but I will try my best to judge the value of the paper. \n\n Having said that, I don\u2019t have enough background knowledge to evaluate the novelty of the paper. For instance, the Theorem 1 is stated as if it was originally introduced in this paper, without any citation. But I doubt that because I could easily find several results relating the convergence rate of SGD to the gradient Lipschitz constant. Are there any papers or standard textbooks to be noted? If so, please cite them properly.\n\nThe theorem 2 and 3 are based on the full-dataset statistics, but because they are infeasible in practice, the authors propose to use the batch statistics. How may this affect the theory? Intuitively, one could easily imagine that the smaller batch-size would lead to higher variances for batch statistics estimators, and thus impeding the regularization effect of the normalization. Also, the theory just states that the upper bound of (Lipschitz constant, gradient variance) after normalization will be lower than the lower bound without normalization, so it is not clear how much the normalization would reduce them. If possible please state the detailed results in the main text. \n\nThe differences between POP-norm and Batch-norm are, 1) whether the normalization is applied before or after the operations, and 2) minor difference in the normalization procedure, such as the additional scaling parameter kappa. The experiments provide results to demonstrate the effectiveness of 1), but not clear about 2). It would be interesting to compare POP-norm to the Batch-norm applied before the operations to see the net effect of 2). The very idea of applying Batch-norm before the convolution operation has already been demonstrated and widely used in the case of ResNet with ReLU activation functions, so if the contribution from 2) is insignificant, I think one may ask the novelty of the proposed normalization scheme.\n\nOverall, despite the lack of background knowledge, I find this paper to be borderline, but more close to the reject, because of some unclear points. I would like to hear back from the authors and other reviewers.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why the matrix B in eq.8 gathering the biases has additional indices 1_k, \u2026, m_k.

The authors motivate their approach theoretically and suggest that this also helps explain BatchNorm\u2019s success due to the similarity between the two approaches. They then empirically examine their method on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet classification.\n\nComments: I find the paper hard to read and and plagued with major technical flaws. The paper also shows unfamiliarity with standard literature on optimization. Some of my major concerns are discussed below:\n\nA. Theoretical Results (Section 2):\n\nThese results (the connections between convergence and gradient Lipshictzness (beta-smoothness) and gradient variance) are extremely well-known (an example reference is Section 3 in arXiv:1909.03550). In fact, the effects of gradient variance on convergence in optimization have prompted a whole sub-field on variance reduced gradient descent methods such as SVRG. Moreover, prior work by Santurkar et al. identifies precisely the same effect (better beta-smoothness) with BatchNorm as one of the factors responsible for its success. \n\nB. Proposed approach:\n\nThe authors claim that one of the key differences between their approach and BatchNorm is dividing by the l2 norm instead of the gradient variance. However, it seems that they take the l2 norm of the random variable after mean subtraction not before (Equations 10 and 12). This is actually the same as the variance of the variable before mean subtraction, which makes this part of their approach identical to BatchNorm. Then the only difference in this aspect of their approach is the way the learned scale and shift is introduced, which seems somewhat arbitrary. \n\nEven more concerning are the claims in Theorems 2 and 3 which justify why mean subtraction and dividing by the l2 norm (variance) help reduce gradient Lipschitz constant/variance. The authors are comparing two upper (or two lower) bounds which is insufficient to draw any meaningful conclusions. In particular, given two random variables X1 and X2, one cannot claim that X1 < X2 based on (arbitrary) upper bounds; especially since there is no evidence that these bounds are tight. \n\nMoreover, all the theoretical analysis in this Section is performed for a single layer of the network assuming other layers are fixed. Specifically, as per their proofs, the gradient of the weights at a particular layer is not dependent by any of the previous/layer layers, thus completely ignoring the effects that come from simultaneously updating all the layers. Thus, the theoretical analysis in this Section does not really tell us about the effects of BatchNorm in a deep network. Their setting is actually identical to studying the effects of input normalization on a single network layer. In this setting, it is well-known that input normalization improves the conditioning of the problem and thus helps optimization ([LeCun et al., 1998 and Wiesler et al., 2011])---in fact, this was actually one of the motivations of the original BatchNorm paper. \n\nC. Experimental Results:\n\nBased on this, it seems to me that the proposed approach is essentially the same as BatchNormalization except for (1) the positioning of the layer (before the weights instead of after), (2) the exact way the learned scale and shift is done and (3) a hyperparameter kappa that is used to scale down the variance of all the layers and hence essentially scales down the learning rate by a constant. \n\nFrom an experimental point of view, I find (3) particularly concerning because it just means that in their learning rate for the POP-Norm experiments are 1/kappa times those for the BatchNorm baseline. Since the authors do not really tune over hyperparameters (they use a fixed learning rate in all their experiments) when comparing the different approaches, it is not clear whether the chosen learning rate is optimal for BatchNorm. To perform a fair comparison of their approach to BatchNorm, the authors should:\n1. Introduce the kappa scaling into BatchNorm layers and see the effect on performance.\n2. Perform a grid search for both methods and report the best performance over hyperparameters.\n3. Also include comparison to other SOTA normalization alternatives (including those that the authors mention in the introduction)\n\nD. Other comments:\ni. The discussion in Section 4 is hard to parse and I am not convinced of its correctness (I am not sure how the authors arrived at (16)).\nii. The paper writing is poor with several typos and spelling mistakes. In addition, the inline math makes the paper very hard to read at times.\n\nOverall, I think there are significant concerns with the paper, both in terms of writing and the soundness/novelty of the technical results and experiments. Thus, I recommend rejection.\n\n------------------------------------------\nReferences:\n\nLeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Orr, G., and Muller, K. Efficient backprop.

It is widely accepted that the great success of BatchNorm is owing to reduction of internal covariate shift (ICS), but recently it is demonstrated that the link between them is fairly weak. The intrinsic reason behind effectiveness of BatchNorm is still unrevealed that limits it to be made better use. In light of this,  we propose a new normalization approach,  referred to as Pre-Operation Normalization (POP-Norm), which is theoretically ensured to speed up the training convergence. Not surprisingly, POP-Norm and BatchNorm are largely the same. Hence the similarities  can help us to theoretically interpret the root of BatchNorm's effectiveness. There are still some significant distinctions between the two approaches. Just the distinctions make POP-Norm achieve faster convergence rate and better performance than BatchNorm, which are validated in extensive experiments on benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012.", "keywords": ["Batch Normalization", "Optimization", "Accelerate Training"], "paperhash": "peng|popnorm_a_theoretically_justified_and_more_accelerated_normalization_approach", "original_pdf": "/attachment/ae33d8d2bf082decc89ab4539c0c5de02c312c8c.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\npeng2020popnorm,\ntitle={{\\{}POP{\\}}-Norm: A Theoretically Justified and More Accelerated Normalization Approach},\nauthor={Hanyang Peng and Shiqi Yu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkevphEYPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
