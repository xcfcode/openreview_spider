The key idea is to model the fertility of each word so that copies for source words are fed as input to the encoder part, not the generated target words as inputs. To achieve the goal, authors investigated various techniques: For inference, sample fertility space for generating multiple possible translations. For training, apply knowledge distilation for better training followed by fine tuning by reinforce. Experiments for English/German and English/Romanian show comparable translation qualities with speedup by non-autoregressive decoding.\n\nThe motivation is clear and proposed methods are very sound. Experiments are carried out very carefully.\n\nI have only minor concerns to this paper:\n\n- The experiments are designed to achieve comparable BLEU with improved latency. I'd like to know whether any BLUE improvement might be possible under similar latency, for instance, by increasing the model size given that inference is already  fast enough.\n\n- It'd also like to see other language pairs with distorted word alignment, e.g., Chinese/English, to further strengthen this work, though  it might have little impact given that attention already capture sort of alignment.\n\n- What is the impact of the external word aligner quality? For instance, it would be possible to introduce a noise in the word alignment results or use smaller data to train a model for word aligner. \n\n- The positional attention is rather unclear and it would be better to revise it.

The advantage is the possibility of more parallel decoding which can result in a significant speed-up (up to a factor of 16 in the experiments described). The disadvantage is that it is more complicated than a standard beam search as auto-regressive teacher models are needed for training and the results do not reach (yet) the same BLEU scores as standard beam search. \n\nOverall, this is an interesting paper. It would have been good to see a speed-accuracy curve which plots decoding speed for different sized models versus the achieved BLUE score on one of the standard benchmarks (like WMT14 en-fr or en-de) to understand better the pros and cons of the proposed approach and to be able to compare models at the same speed or the same BLEU scores. Table 1 gives a hint of that but it is not clear whether much smaller models with standard beam search are possibly as good and fast as NAT -- losing 2-5 BLEU points on WMT14 is significant.  While the Ro->En results are good, this particular language pair has not been used much by others; it would have been more interesting to stay with a single well-used language pair and benchmark and analyze why WMT14 en->de and de->en are not improving more. Finally it would have been good to address total computation in the comparison as well -- it seems while total decoding time is smaller total computation for NAT + NPD is actually higher depending on the choice of s.\n ", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Existing approaches to neural machine translation condition each output word on previously generated outputs.

But no amount of kernel optimization or model size reduction can change the sequential nature of autoregressive translation; the autoregressive latency will always be proportional to the sentence length and the NAT will be faster when sequences are sufficiently long. The non-autoregressive Transformer can also benefit from low-level optimizations like quantization; we believe we compared the two on an even footing by using similar implementations for both.\n\nAlso, while the original Transformer paper provided a strong set of baseline hyperparameters for the autoregressive architecture given a particular model size, we would need to conduct a significant amount of additional search to identify the right parameter settings for other model sizes. Instead we chose to focus our computational resources on the ablation study and more language pairs.\n\nWe think the difference between the EN<\u2013>DE and EN<\u2013>RO results may be the result of a greater need for long-distance (clause-level) reordering between English and German (which are closely related languages with significant differences in sentence structure) than between English and Romanian (which, while less closely related, have more similarities in word order); this is an interesting direction for future research.\n\nAs for computation time, we are making the assumption that a significant amount of parallelism is available and the primary metric is the latency on the critical path. This is not necessarily the case for every deployment of machine translation in practice, but it is a metric on which existing neural MT systems perform particularly poorly. Given that assumption, the additional computation needed for NPD, while potentially significant in terms of throughput, would not result in more than a doubling of latency."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Existing approaches to neural machine translation condition each output word on previously generated outputs.

While we did not conduct an exhaustive search over e.g. a range of possible values for the weights on each fine-tuning loss, we tried to present a reasonably comprehensive set of ablations to identify the effect of each part of our methodology. \n\nWe also agree that IBM 2 might not be the best possible choice of fertility inference model, since the model itself only considers fertility implicitly (as part of the alignment process) and not explicitly like IBM 3+. Our decision to use IBM 2 was based on the availability, performance, and ease of integration of a popular existing implementation (fast_align) of that particular alignment model. Meanwhile, the use of fertility supervision in the first place can be justified from two perspectives: from the variational inference perspective, an external alignment model provides a very simple and tractable proposal distribution; at a higher level, fertility supervision simply turns a difficult, unsupervised learning problem into an easier, supervised one."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Existing approaches to neural machine translation condition each output word on previously generated outputs.

We introduce a model that avoids this autoregressive property and produces its outputs in parallel, allowing an order of magnitude lower latency during inference. Through knowledge distillation, the use of input token fertilities as a latent variable, and policy gradient fine-tuning, we achieve this at a cost of as little as 2.0 BLEU points relative to the autoregressive Transformer network used as a teacher. We demonstrate substantial cumulative improvements associated with each of the three aspects of our training strategy, and validate our approach on IWSLT 2016 English\u2013German and two WMT language pairs. By sampling fertilities in parallel at inference time, our non-autoregressive model achieves near-state-of-the-art performance of 29.8 BLEU on WMT 2016 English\u2013Romanian.", "pdf": "/pdf/a5d2f63fd149ecdf6ced09eede7f7556b67bd662.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce the first NMT model with fully parallel decoding, reducing inference latency by 10x.", "paperhash": "gu|nonautoregressive_neural_machine_translation", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ngu2018nonautoregressive,\ntitle={Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation},\nauthor={Jiatao Gu and James Bradbury and Caiming Xiong and Victor O.K.
