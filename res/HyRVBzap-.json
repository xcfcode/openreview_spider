The authors demonstrate on MNIST and CIFAR that the added regularization leads to more robustness to various kinds of attacks. The authors further propose to enhance the network with cascaded adversarial training, that is, learning against iteratively generated adversarial inputs, and showed improved performance against harder attacks. \n\nThe idea proposed is fairly straight-forward. Despite being a simple approach, the experimental results are quite promising.  The analysis on the gradient correlation coefficient and label leaking phenomenon provide some interesting insights.  \n\nAs pointed out in section 4.2, increasing the regularization coefficient leads to degenerated embeddings. Have the authors consider distance metrics that are less sensitive to the magnitude of the embeddings, for example, normalizing the inputs before sending it to the bidirectional or pivot loss, or use cosine distance etc.?\n\nTable 4 and 5 seem to suggest that cascaded adversarial learning have more negative impact on test set with one-step attacks than clean test set, which is a bit counter-intuitive. Do the authors have any insight on this? \n\nComments:\n1. The writing of the paper could be improved. For example, \"Transferability analysis\" in section 1 is barely understandable;\n2.

This is an interesting idea which, from a robustness point of view (Xu et al, 2013) makes sense. Note that a similar strategy has been used in the recent past under the name of stability training. The proposed method works well on CIFAR and MNIST datasets. My main concerns are:\n\n\t- The adversarial objective and the stability objective are potentially conflicting. Indeed when the network misclassifies an example, its adversarial version is forced to be close to it in embedding space while the adversarial term promotes a different prediction from the clean version (that of the ground truth label). Have the authors considered this issue? Can they elaborate more on how they with this?\n\n\t- It may be significantly more difficult to make this work in such setting due to the dimensionality of the data. Did the authors try such experiment? It would be interesting to see these results. \n\nLastly, The insights regarding label leaking are not compelling.  Label leaking is not a mysterious phenomenon. An adversarially trained model learns on two different distributions. Given the fixed size of the hypothesis space explored (i.e., same architecture used for vanilla and adversarial training), It is natural that the statistics of the simpler distribution are captured better by the model. Overall, the paper contains valuable information and a method that can contribute to the quest of more robust models. I lean on accept side.  \n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cascade Adversarial Machine Learning Regularized with a Unified Embedding", "abstract": "Injecting adversarial examples during training, known as adversarial training, can improve robustness against one-step attacks, but not for unknown iterative attacks.

It seems to perform well in practice as shown in the experimental section.\nThe experimental section is extensive, and offers new insights into both the presented algorithm and baselines.

I'd highly recommend the authors to cut a third of their text, it would help focus the paper on the actual message: pushing their new algorithm. Try to remove any sentence or word that doesn't serve a purpose (help sell the algorithm).\nThe structure of the paper could also be improved. For example the cascade adversarial training is buried deep inside the experimental section. Considering that it is part of the title, I would have expected a proper exposition of the idea in the technical section (before any results are presented). While condensing the paper, consider presenting all technical material before evaluation.\nFinally, the pivot \"loss\" seems a bit hacky. First, the pivot objective and bidirectional loss are exactly the same thing. While the bidirectional loss is a proper loss and optimized as such (by optimizing both E^adv and E), the pivot objective is no loss function, as it does not correspond to any function any optimization algorithm could minimize. I'd recommend the just remove the pivot objective, or at least not call it a loss.\n\nIn summary, the results and presented method are good, and eventually deserve publication.

Have the authors consider distance metrics that are less sensitive to the magnitude of the embeddings, for example, normalizing the inputs before sending it to the bidirectional or pivot loss, or use cosine distance etc.?\n(Ans) We would like to mention that every regularization technique including weight decay (L1/L2 regularization) has the problem of degenerated embeddings if we weigh more on the regularized term. We have applied regularization after normalizing embeddings (divided by the standard deviation of the embeddings). As we increase lambda_2, the mean of the embeddings remains the same, but, the standard deviation of the embeddings becomes large. That means intra class variation becomes large. We eventually observed degenerated embeddings (lower accuracy on the clean example) for large lambda_2 which is the same phenomenon with our original version of implementation.\n\nQ2- Table 4 and 5 seem to suggest that cascaded adversarial learning have more negative impact on test set with one-step attacks than clean test set, which is a bit counter-intuitive. Do the authors have any insight on this? \n(Ans) The purpose of cascade adversarial training is to improve the robustness against \u201citerative\u201d attack. And we showed the effectiveness of the method showing increased accuracy against iterative attack, but, at the expense of decreased accuracy against one-step attack.\nWe have observed this phenomenon (the networks shown to be robust against iterative attacks tends to less robust against one-step attacks) in various conditions including ensemble adversarial training. We feel that in somehow, there is trade-off between them. Based on our extensive empirical experiments, it was very hard to increase robustness against both one-step attack and iterative attack. It is a still open question why this is so difficult, but, we assume that high dimensionality of the input is one reason for this. That means once we find good defense for some adversarial direction, there exists another adversarial direction which breaks the defense.\nFinally, we would like to mention that even though we have observed decreased accuracy for the one-step attack from cascade adversarial training, accuracy gain on the iterative attacks in white box setting helps increase in robustness against black box attack (for both one-step and iterative attacks.)\n\nQ3 - The writing of the paper could be improved. For example, \"Transferability analysis\" in section 1 is barely understandable;\n(Ans) We\u2019ve updated the manuscript. Essentially, the detailed analysis can be found in new section 3.1.\n\nQ4 - Arrow in Figure 3 are not quite readable;\n(Ans) We\u2019ve re-drawn the arrow from e to e+8 instead of e+4 to increase readability in revised version.\n\nQ5 - The paper is over 11 pages. The authors might want to consider shrink it down the recommended length. \n(Ans) We\u2019ve updated the manuscript.

Indeed when the network misclassifies an example, its adversarial version is forced to be close to it in embedding space while the adversarial term promotes a different prediction from the clean version (that of the ground truth label). Have the authors considered this issue? Can they elaborate more on how they with this?\n(Ans) Yes, we totally agree with that the objective of the image classification and similarity objective can be potentially conflicting each other. We would like to address that our distance based loss can be considered as a way of regularization. Like every regularization, for example, weight L1/L2 regularization which penalizes the large value of the weights, too much regularization can always damage the training process.\nIf the classifier misclassifies the clean version, that means the example is hard example. Adversarial version of the hard example will also be misclassified. Instead of trying to always encourage to produce ground truth, the similarity loss will encourage adversarial version to mimic the clean version. We can think this is somewhat analogous to student-teacher learning where student network is trained with the soft target from the teacher network instead of conventional hard target.\n\nQ2- It may be significantly more difficult to make this work in such setting due to the dimensionality of the data. Did the authors try such experiment? It would be interesting to see these results.\n(Ans) We have applied low level similarity learning for ImageNet dataset. We observed similar results (A network trained with pivot loss showed improved accuracy for white box iterative attacks compared to the network trained with adversarial training only.) We will augment those results in the final version. Due to the lack of computing resources, however, we haven\u2019t tried training several similar networks with different initialization and testing those networks under white box and black box scenario. \nIf you are talking about the dimensionality of the embedding, we actually have applied similarity loss on un-normalized logits (the layer right before the softmax layer) where the dimension of the embedding is exact the same with the number of labels which we don\u2019t think a problem. We have tried applying similarity loss on intermediate neurons (that means different size of the embeddings), and found that applying similarity loss is efficient when we apply this at the very end of the network.\n\nQ3- Lastly, The insights regarding label leaking are not compelling\n(Ans) There is no clear evidence that the distribution of the one-step adversarial images is simpler than the distribution of the clean images. Adversarial images have meant to be created to fool the network. If we think the images with random noise, and train a network with clean and noisy images, we observe the decreased accuracy for noisy images since we lost the information due to the noise. Considering the fact that the adversarial images can be viewed as images with additive noise, label leaking phenomenon is not well understood since we actually added some noise which is intentional. Correlation analysis reveals the reason behind this effect.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cascade Adversarial Machine Learning Regularized with a Unified Embedding", "abstract": "Injecting adversarial examples during training, known as adversarial training, can improve robustness against one-step attacks, but not for unknown iterative attacks.

We have changed the structure/length of the paper in revised version. In revised version, the contents are essentially the same with those in the previous version. We only changed structure/length of the paper. As the reviewer suggested, we have included exposition of the idea in the technical section before the experimental results.\nOnly the transferability analysis has been included before the experimental results since we found it is necessary to show \u2018higher transferability of the iterative adversarial examples between defended networks\u2019 to introduce our proposed cascade adversarial training.\nThank you very much for your valuable feedback which greatly improved the quality of the revised manuscript.\n\nQ2 - pivot loss seems hacky\n(Ans) Initially, we didn\u2019t want to hurt the accuracy for the clean data, and that motivated us to invent pivot loss. In pivot loss, we assume clean embeddings as ground truth embeddings that adversarial embeddings have to mimic. \nBidirectional loss and pivot loss have the same mathematical form, however, in pivot loss, embeddings from the clean examples are treated as constants (non-trainable). For pivot loss, it actually computes gradients with back-propagation, but only through embeddings computed from adversarial images.\nWe can also think this is somewhat analogous to student-teacher learning where student network (adversarial embedding) is trained with the soft target from the teacher network (clean embedding) instead of conventional hard target.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cascade Adversarial Machine Learning Regularized with a Unified Embedding", "abstract": "Injecting adversarial examples during training, known as adversarial training, can improve robustness against one-step attacks, but not for unknown iterative attacks. To address this challenge, we first show iteratively generated adversarial images easily transfer between networks trained with the same strategy. Inspired by this observation, we propose cascade adversarial training, which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training. We train a network from scratch by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks in addition to one-step adversarial images from the network being trained. We also propose to utilize embedding space for both classification and low-level (pixel-level) similarity learning to ignore unknown pixel level perturbation. During training, we inject adversarial images without replacing their corresponding clean images and penalize the distance between the two embeddings (clean and adversarial).
