As such, I recommend that the paper be rejected in its current form. I would encourage the authors to apply their analysis and method to more recent contrastive instance discrimination approaches such as SimCLR and SWaV as well as non-explicitly contrastive, but high performing methods like BYOL. I would also encourage the authors to provide quantitative empirical analyses demonstrating the impact of the consistency term on large models rather than just toy models to demonstrate the impact of the consistency term in representational space.

Here by positive, I mean samples that are different views of the same instance. Likewise, by negative I mean samples that are from different instances. That being said, explicitly adding L_c term with hyperparameter \\alpha provided more fixability in balancing the push/repel phenomenon by tuning the hyper-parameter \\alpha.\n\n*__A1__: This raised a good point.*\n\n*We agree that in some problems, L_C and L_S might be redundant. But, in our problem: instance classification with 1M categories, merely optimizing L_S is hard, and adding the consistency loss, L_C aims to help optimize the classification loss. It is not redundant in our application.* \n\n*We assume that by balancing the push/repel phenomenon (mentioned by you), it means to adjust the degrees of push and/repel provided in the classification loss L_S, i.e., the optimal parameters that minimizes  the classification loss is not good. In fact, we DO NOT aim to have a better balance, and instead, we still want to optimize the classification loss better and we pick the model parameters with smaller classification loss. In Figure 3, we show that when alpha < 2.5, the classification loss is optimized better than without using the consistency loss L_C. Experiment results also show that the model parameters with smaller L_S has better downstream performance.*\n\n**Q2**: Compared to the state-of-the-art methods reported in Table 2, the improvements are really really minor. In fact, in most columns, there is no meaningful improvement.\n\n*__A2__: Thanks for raising the issue. Our approach is more advantageous in the downstream task semantic segmentation with an absolute 0.9 IoU improvement on Cityscapes, and in other tasks, the improvements are relatively minor. We note that in Table 2, our improvements are consistent for most downstream tasks.*\n\n*More significantly, we demonstrate that one difficulty of the instance classification framework with 1M categories for unsupervised representation learning lies in the optimization side. We discussed this in Section 3.1 and the third paragraph in Section 1. MoCo uses the moving average scheme to compute the classifier weight estimate, easing the optimization.  And SimCLR, whose objective function might be better than instance classification, however, needs large batch size, which is discussed in the last part about \u201cBatch size\u201d in Section 3. With the consistency term, the instance classification loss is better optimized, and the learned representation achieves superior/comparable performance for downstream tasks compared to MoCo/SimCLR.*\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2240/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2240/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Consistent Instance Classification for Unsupervised Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Depu_Meng1", "~Zigang_Geng1", "~Zhirong_Wu1", "~Bin_Xiao2", "~Houqiang_Li1", "~Jingdong_Wang1"], "authors": ["Depu Meng", "Zigang Geng", "Zhirong Wu", "Bin Xiao", "Houqiang Li", "Jingdong Wang"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of learning the representations from images without human annotations.

Specifically, in addition to the standard classification loss term that views each image (and its augmentation) as a separate category, a second loss term is added, which is 1 minus the inner product of the representations for two augmentation views of the same image.  In a sense, this is incorporating an aspect of the contrasting learning approach, as two views of the same image are being explicitly pulled toward one another due to the consistency loss.  \n\nPositives:\n+ sensitivity analysis with respect to the balancing coefficient $\\alpha$ between the classification loss and consistency loss demonstrates that there is an optimal $\\alpha$ such that the consistency loss leads to a minimum of the classification loss, even compared with setting $\\alpha=0$.  In other words, the consistency loss is helping to optimize the classification loss.\n+ related to above, empirical results and ablation study demonstrates the benefit of adding in consistency loss for subsequent downstream tasks\n+ qualitatively, adding the consistency loss seems to help the network focus on relevant/textured regions of the images\n\nNegatives:\n- Novelty is arguably somewhat limited, as the proposed method boils down to adding a term that encourages similarity between two views of the same image, very similar to contrastive learning.\n- Empirical results are mixed - in general on-par with existing methods.  Performance is generally consistent across the explored tasks, but does not appear to be significant better than existing approaches.  One data point that would be of interest is whether the proposed approach does better when training for more epochs, similar to methods such as SwAV or MoCo v2 on ImageNet linear evaluation.\n\nOverall summary: \n\nGiven the negatives mentioned above, I currently see the paper as being borderline/marginally below threshold.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2240/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2240/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Consistent Instance Classification for Unsupervised Representation Learning", "authorids": ["~Depu_Meng1", "~Zigang_Geng1", "~Zhirong_Wu1", "~Bin_Xiao2", "~Houqiang_Li1", "~Jingdong_Wang1"], "authors": ["Depu Meng", "Zigang Geng", "Zhirong Wu", "Bin Xiao", "Houqiang Li", "Jingdong Wang"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of learning the representations from images without human annotations.
