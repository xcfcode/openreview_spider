", "abstract": "Current model-based reinforcement learning methods struggle when operating from complex visual scenes due to their inability to prioritize task-relevant features. To mitigate this problem, we propose learning Task Informed Abstractions (TIA) that separates reward-correlated visual features from background distractions. For learning TIA, we introduce the formalism of Task Informed MDP (TiMDP), which is realized by training two models that learn visual features via cooperative reconstruction, but one model is adversarially dissociated from the reward signal. Empirical evaluation shows that TIA leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on many visual control tasks where natural and unconstrained visual distractions pose a formidable challenge.", "pdf": "/pdf/41151ef29208f1615cd21f3779a1fe93eafc81ff.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|learning_task_informed_abstractions", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021learning,\ntitle={Learning Task Informed Abstractions},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning Workshop - ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=39br-2YuZCt},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615310247528, "tmdate": 1615313016556, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
