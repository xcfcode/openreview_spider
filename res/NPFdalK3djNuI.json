We will try to address some of these below: (There is a revised version on arXiv now.)\r\n\r\n***Bandwidth expansion experiment***\r\n\r\nWe respectfully disagree with the comment that 'The gains using the proposed model are however not very significant.' Compared with the best competing approach our PoF-based approach achieves a gain of more than half a point on Hu and Loizou's OVRL composite objective measure, going from a predicted subjective evaluation of 'poor-to-fair' to 'fair-to-good'. Admittedly the results on the STOI intelligibility metric are less impressive, but given that telephone-quality speech is already quite intelligible we feel that this metric is less meaningful than the OVRL metric.\r\n\r\n***Speaker identification experiment***\r\n\r\nIn our most recent submission we have expanded this experiment from the original 10-speaker task to a much more difficult 200-speaker task, and explored how PoFCs and MFCCs perform as more data becomes available from each speaker. In all cases PoFCs dramatically outperformed MFCCs.\r\n\r\n***Applicability to speech/phoneme recognition***\r\n\r\nThe reviewer asks 'Can phoneme recognition experiments be performed using TIMIT using the derived features?' This is indeed a natural question, and we ran a phoneme recognition experiment to answer it. We trained a deep neural network (using dropout and rectified linear nonlinearities) using PoFCs and another using the log-output of a melfilterbank. The network using PoFCs achieved a phone error rate (PER) of ~24%, and the network using the raw filterbank achieved a PER of ~21%, which is near the current state of the art on TIMIT.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that, although PoFCs do capture much of the information in the spectrum, the deep network works best with lower-level data. This is perhaps not surprising; the deep network learns features that are tuned specifically for this phoneme recognition problem, whereas PoFCs are trained without supervision. We think that PoFCs are more likely to be useful in settings where less data per class is available, such as in the speaker recognition problem described in section 5.2."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Generative Product-of-Filters Model of Audio", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "We propose the product-of-filters (PoF) model, a generative model that decomposes audio spectra as sparse linear combinations of 'filters' in the log-spectral domain.

It explains them as products of spectral bases, i.e., sums of log-spectral bases.  The paper describes a mean field variational approximation for the posterior of the activations of each basis given an observed spectrum, and a variational EM algorithm for learning the model parameters.  It applies the model to performing bandwidth extension for unknown talkers and frame-based speaker identification, outperforming reasonable baseline approaches in both.\r\n\r\nNovelty and quality: As far as I know, this method is novel.  The background literature review correctly points to the connections with traditional methods of homomorphic filtering and non-negative matrix factorization.  While it is not entirely clear how widely this method can be applied, especially with the high current computational cost of learning the model parameters compared to a traditional fixed basis like mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), it does significantly outperform baseline systems on the two experimental tasks described.  Specifically, real sounds only rarely involve a single source, but, as mentioned in the paper, this model could provide a prior on each source in a multi-source mixture.\r\n\r\nPros: \r\n* Interesting model \r\n* Shows good experimental results \r\n* Well written\r\n\r\nCons: \r\n* Some mathematical details could be spelled out more explicitly \r\n* Possibly limited applicability\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor comments:\r\n\r\nPage 2: 'Another attractive feature is the symmetry between the excitation signal e[n] and the impulse response h[n] of the vocal-tract filter\u2014convolution commutes.'\r\n\r\nPlease explain why this is an attractive feature of the model.
