Current approaches may suffer from an instability in training by using GANs (which are sensitive to hyper-parameters and model collapse).

The main idea is to plug in a generative function learned from the source domain as a way to change the latent variables in the target domain, so that a mapping function T() is further used align them together. \n\nThe idea appears useful, however, it would be interesting if the authors could discuss in more detail how the mapping T() tends to align the distribution of the two domains. In case z (X domain hidden variable) and sy (Y domain hidden variable) have different concentrations (ie distribution), the mapping can be unstable compared with considering aligning the two distributions directly. Besides, the experimental results are very limited and only shown in terms of visual comparisons. which is difficult to fully demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.\n", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "NAM - Unsupervised Cross-Domain Image Mapping without Cycles or GANs", "abstract": "Several methods were recently proposed for Unsupervised Domain Mapping, which is the task of translating images between domains without prior knowledge of correspondences.
