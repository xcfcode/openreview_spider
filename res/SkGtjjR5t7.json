Motion planning is really useful in cases where the cost function, constraints, and dynamics are clear; none of that is true for driving -- writing down the true cost we want optimized is hard and contextual, and the dynamics are hard especially because they involve other people in the environment and what they will do; we thus think it's useful to see how far imitation learning can be pushed as an alternative. We would also like to emphasize that this is not only useful for driving the car, but also can be integrated within a motion planner as a model of how other people will act.\n\n\u201cData collection details\u201d: Data about the prior map of the environment (roadmap) and the speed-limits along the lanes is collected apriori. For the dynamic scene entities like objects and traffic-lights, we employ a separate perception system based on laser and camera data similar to existing works in the literature [1,2].

These drives are shown in the supplemental website [ https://sites.google.com/view/learn-to-drive#h.p_cxFQRIZYOQ7o ].\n\nLogged Ablation Data: This is the same as above, except that we modify some of the rendered inputs like removing the stop-signs or other dynamic objects to generate the input ablation results in section 6.3.2 and the videos on the supplemental site [ https://sites.google.com/view/learn-to-drive#h.p_WjtxfxJsNmJT ].\n\nReal Drive: This is where we let the network drive a real car [ https://sites.google.com/view/learn-to-drive#h.p_zId3Ux6DONGv ].\n\n\u201cContribution Summary\u201d: We have updated the introduction to clarify the contributions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Drive by Observing the Best and Synthesizing the Worst", "abstract": "Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle.

Specifically for the nudging experiment, we generate several variations by changing the starting speed of the agent relative to the parked car. This creates situations of increasing difficulty, where the agent approaches the parked car at very high relative speed and thus does not have enough time to nudge around the car given the dynamic constraints. A 10% collision rate in this case is thus not a measure of the absolute performance of the model since we don\u2019t have a perfect driver which could have performed well at all the scenarios here. The focus of our experiments is on the relative improvement in performance across models. M3 and M4 only differ in the use of either a weighted or a dropout strategy for combining imitation vs environment losses. In the case of the slowing down experiment, M4 collides with the curb (not the vehicle) in one scenario in trying to pass the slow vehicle (again for the variation at the extreme initialization of approaching at the highest relative speed) but we find that it does much better in all other scenarios and is thus our proposed model. The fact that M3 collides 45% of the time in the nudging experiments points to its inability to deal with real collisions.\n\n\u201cReal driving experiments\u201d: Being able to drive a real vehicle with this approach is the most exciting aspect of this work -- no other imitation learning system has ever accomplished this. Most recent works demonstrate the performance of their setup either in an open-loop setting or in a closed-loop simulation setup like CARLA which does not suffer from challenges like controller errors, actuator delays and perception errors. Our video results from the real-drive illustrate not only the smoothness of the network\u2019s driving ability, but also its ability to deal with stop-signs and turns and to drive for long durations in full closed-loop control without deviating from the trajectory (as would be the case if one were to use pure behavior cloning). Performing quantitative evaluations in the real world safely, and developing the right metrics to compare against other planners including classical planners remains future work.\n\n\u201cEquation 3\u201d: The ground truth distribution P_k^{gt} is simply a dirac delta function with a value of 1 at the spatial coordinate of the target waypoint and zero everywhere else. The loss L_p = H(P_k, P_k^{gt}) thus measures the cross-entropy between the two probability distributions where P_k is the predicted distribution. We have clarified this in the revised version.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Drive by Observing the Best and Synthesizing the Worst", "abstract": "Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle.

In fact, most teams on the DARPA Urban Challenge employed the Velodyne HDL-64E as their primary sensor which had an effective vehicle detection range of only 60 meters [3].

We have uploaded a revised version which clarifies several technical details. Responses to your concerns follow:\n\n\u201cNo-regret formulation\u201d: As suggested, this would require interaction with an expert. In a real world setting, the car would have to start driving, perform out-of-distribution maneuvers, and have the human driver correct it at every step. This is not a safe setup and instead, one would need to rely on offline data or accurate simulation. The novelty of our approach is to demonstrate that we can learn to drive well in complex scenarios beyond simple lane following from offline expert data without requiring a simulator and without doing RL.\n\n\u201cPath feasibility\u201d: We train this network on time sampled expert driving trajectories and hence the network has seen only valid trajectories that satisfy the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the non-holonomic agent. In addition, to generate synthesized trajectories from the perturbed waypoints, we also employ a non-linear optimizer that obeys the same constraints to ensure that the generated synthesized trajectories are feasible to drive as well.

Specifically, we have shown that these help in (a) handling the covariate shift during closed loop control by teaching the network the idea of course correction, and (b) teaching the network the idea of collision avoidance without having expert demonstrations of the same in the training data. Furthermore, we introduce the general idea of synthesizing perturbations and if required, more complex kinds of perturbations can be introduced to the network in a similar fashion. We show that perturbations help, but expecting them to handle the long tail is too high of a bar that no imitation learning based system would meet.\n\n\u201cEnvironment extent\u201d: We run the network at 5Hz and since the coordinate system of the top-down view moves with the agent, we found it to be sufficient for control on surface streets. Our predicted trajectory goes to 2s into the future and is sampled every 0.2s. We see 64m ahead of the agent and at 25 mph this gives us a time horizon of 5.72s. We do not see any fundamental flaw in this approach since it is akin to having a self-driving car with sensors that see only up to 64 meters. In fact, most teams on the DARPA Urban Challenge employed the Velodyne HDL-64E as their primary sensor which had an effective vehicle detection range of only 60m [3]. The only practical limits we have found from this range are in cases like T-junctions where we have limited visibility on the sides. However, this is not a limitation of the core concepts presented in the paper -- we can easily increase the extent of the input image at the cost of additional computation.\n\n[3] Montemerlo, Michael, et al. \"Junior: The stanford entry in the urban challenge.\" Journal of field Robotics 25.9 (2008): 569-597.\n\n\u201cSelf-driving\u201d: Our work is about getting imitation learning to the level where it has a shot at driving a real vehicle; although the same insights may apply to other domains, these domains might have different constraints and opportunities, so we do not want to claim contributions there. We have revised the paper to reflect this. Furthermore, we believe that the self-driving domain is an area of broad interest for the machine learning research community as is evident from the surge in papers on using machine learning techniques for planning and prediction in this domain. \n\n<response continued below>"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Drive by Observing the Best and Synthesizing the Worst", "abstract": "Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle.

We have uploaded a revised version that clarifies the technical details but to answer your questions more directly:\n\n\u201cPixel sizes, time resolution, vehicle position etc.\u201d: As suggested in the author guidelines, we listed these details in Table 3 in the Appendix as we considered them important for reproducibility but not for the core understanding of the paper. We have moved this table into the main text in the revised version. We will appreciate your feedback on any other key details that we might have missed.\n\n\u201cTraffic lights\u201d: The sequence dimension represents past timesteps like the other channels. Each frame in the sequence is a gray-scale image with a specific intensity representing a specific traffic light state for each lane. For example, we use an intensity of 96 to represent a green signal and 224 to represent a red signal. We have revised the description in the new paper version.\n\n\u201cVideos\u201d: Each frame of the video represents the current state of the environment as follows: video_t = max(roadmap_t, route_t, current_agent_box_t, past_agent_poses_t, predicted_future_poses_{1,10}, traffic_lights_t, dynamic_boxes_past), with specific mapping of specific channels to individual colors in the output for ease of viewing. To aid visualization of the movement of dynamic objects, we combine the sequence of dynamic_boxes_{t-1,...,t} using a weighted sum to generate the dynamic_boxes_past channel above.\n\n\u201cDashed arrows\u201d: The dashed arrows represent the recurrent feedback of predictions from iteration k as inputs into iteration k+1. We have clarified this in the paper now.\n\n\u201cRegression tower\u201d: We use a shallow convolutional network with a fully-connected layer at the end for this. We use \u201ctowers\u201d to imply any building block consisting of a sequence of basic convolutional, space-to-depth, depth-to-space, fully-connected and activation layers. We have clarified this in the paper.\n\n\u201cEqn 3\u201d: The logits P_k represent a probability distribution and the cross-entropy function H thus computes a single cross-entropy value for the input P_k and P_k^gt without the need for a summation over pixels.\n\n\u201cSection 4.1.2\u201d: We have added further details to the revised version. The prediction P_k is a probability distribution over the next predicted waypoint and we pick and arg-max over this distribution to sample an integer coordinate. To refine this to sub-pixel resolution, the agent-meta prediction network produces subpixel values \\delta{p_k} = (\\delta_x, \\delta_y) which are then compared with the ground-truth values using L1 norm as in equation 6. Similarly, it produces a speed value s_k which is compared with the target value using L1 norm as well. Theses losses are included as part of the imitation losses during the training loop similar to the other losses as described in section 5.3.\n\n\u201cPast motion dropout\u201d: We keep only the current position of the agent in the past_agent_poses channel. This is a fixed point (u_0, v_0) in the top-down view. The other remaining input channels remain unchanged.\n\n\u201cFigure 6\u201d: Thanks for pointing this out! We have removed this reference from the main text.\n\n\u201cPerturbation about vertical axis\u201d: This is only done during training as a data augmentation mechanism. Clarified in section 6.2.\n\n\u201cOpen- and closed-loop\u201d: Consider a sequence of logged data obtained from an expert driving the car. At each timestep in this sequence, we have information about the agent\u2019s past trajectory and we can use this (along with the other features) to create an input for the network. The network then predicts a set of waypoint coordinates which can then be compared to the actual future trajectory of the agent from the log. The L2 distance between the predicted and ground-truth waypoints is plotted in Fig. 5 as the open loop evaluation. Note that at each time step in this evaluation, the agent follows the logged pose exactly and we are just evaluating the network predictions against the ground-truth. In a closed-loop setting, we would like to actually drive the agent using the predicted trajectory and for this, we first convert the predicted trajectory to a set of controls and then use a vehicle simulator to drive the agent forward. This will drive the agent independent of the log from this point forward ultimately generating poses which were never seen in the log. This can thus put the input to the network outside the training distribution thus leading to poor predictions and hence poor driving behavior. However, this is what we care about and hence the evaluations in closed-loop settings are crucial. We have also clarified this in the revised paper.\n\n<response continued below>\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Drive by Observing the Best and Synthesizing the Worst", "abstract": "Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle.

The policy takes as input a parsed representation of the scene (rather than raw images) and outputs pose trajectories for a down-stream controller. The method is trained on simulated data that includes perturbations to improve generalizability. The framework is evaluated in simulation through a series of ablations to better understand the contribution of the different loss terms.\n\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\n+ Paper acknowledges the difficulty of end-to-end (pixels-to-torque) learning for autonomous driving and instead reasons over pre-processed inputs in the form of lower-dimensional images (and image sequences) that capture obstacles as bounding boxes and simple lines for routes, grayscale intensities, etc. Similarly, the output is a trajectory that is then fed to a controller responsible for tracking this trajectory.\n\n\nWEAKNESSES\n\n- The insufficiency of behavioral cloning is not surprising, as noted, given the covariate shift. It would be interesting to consider a  no-regret formulation analogous to Ross et al., 2011, even though it would require interaction with a human.\n\n- The limitation of producing paths in this way is that the network does not explicitly reason over the feasibility of the path, which is important for non-holonomic vehicles. Instead, the network must learn the kinematic and dynamic constraints.\n\n- Perturbations of the simulated trajectories are used to expose the model to collisions and other rare events, but is not clear that simple trajectory perturbations such as those used here provide a sufficient exposure to these rare events.\n\n- The fact that the 2D image that expresses the vehicle's position is absolute limits the environment in which the network is valid. The experiments are conducted on images corresponding to an 80m x 80m environment, which is trivially small.\n\n- The proposed framework is highly specific to self-driving and the extent to which it provides insights for other domains is not clear.\n\n- The ablation experiments are not very compelling. In the case of the nudging experiment, all models result in collisions with M4 being the best model with a 10% collision rate. The trajectory perturbation results are better. In the case of the slowing experiment, M3 is the only version to not result in collision, whereas M4 collides 5% of the time. It isn't clear than which model is preferable since, while M3 never collides in the case of the slowing down experiment, it collides 45% of the time in the nudging experiment, almost as frequently as the M0 baseline.\n\n- The paper claims that the model was run on a real robot, but there is no experimental evaluation of the results, only a reference to videos. The results of these experiments should be quantified and discussed or the reference to running on a real vehicle should be toned down, if not removed.\n\n- Equation 3 requires knowledge of the ground-truth distribution.

Instead of using a raw image, a set of handcrafted features (i.e., the status of traffic lights, route, roadmap, etc) are mapped onto a fixed-size of bird-eye view map, which is then fed into the recurrent neural network. Additional regularizing loss terms are explored for the robustness of the model. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in simulation and real-world experiment.\n\nStrengths.\n- Impressive demonstrations in simulation and real-world experiments.\n- The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.\n\nvs. Existing motion planning approaches.\nThere exists a large volume of papers on vehicle motion planning, which has largely been explored for controlling self-driving vehicles. Some of them successfully demonstrated their effectiveness for navigating a vehicle in typical driving scenarios, including \u201cslowing down for a slow car\u201d.\nA notable survey may include:\n\n[1] Paden et al., \u201cA survey of motion planning and control techniques for self-driving urban vehicles,\u201d IEEE Transactions on intelligent vehicles, 2016. \n\nHowever, the paper provides neither any works of literature on existing motion planners nor any types of comparison with them. This makes hard to judge the proposed learning-based motion planner outperforms others including conventional optimization-based methods. \n\nMissing data collection details.\nThis work depends hugely on its own human-designated oracle-like map, which provides driving-related features, such as lane, the status of traffic lights, speed limits, desired route, dynamic objects, etc. Generating this map would not be a trivial task, but details are missing on (1) how this data collected and (2) how this data can be collected during the testing time (especially for dynamic objects/traffic light status). Section 6.2 should be explained more in detail.\n\nA weak novelty of using intermediate-level input/output representation.\nThere exist similar approaches that utilized similar representations to determine a vehicle\u2019s behaviour, examples may include:\n\n[1] Lee et al., \u201cConvolution Neural Network-based Lane Change Intention Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles for ACC,\u201d IEEE ITSC 2017.\n[2] We et al., \u201cModeling trajectories with recurrent neural networks,\u201d IJCAI, 2017.\n\nMissing evaluation details.\nIn Section 6.2, (though not mentioned) it seems that a training dataset is collected from 60-days of real-world driving (given the context). But, in the testing phase, it seems that the authors used a simulator to evaluate different driving scenarios with various initial condition (i.e., speed, heading angle, position, etc). Can authors clarify details of the evaluation environment?\n\nMinor concerns.\nA paragraph of contribution summary (in Introduction section) will help. \nTypos (e.g., Section 2 line 17: \u2018off of\u2019)", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper641/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Drive by Observing the Best and Synthesizing the Worst", "abstract": "Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle.
