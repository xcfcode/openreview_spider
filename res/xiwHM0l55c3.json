Confidence: 4", "review": "Summary:\n\nThis paper tackles the energy optimization problem of chiller plants, which are the main equipment of a cooling system. This paper aims to learn the non-linear mapping between the control parameters (of a cooling system) and energy consumption. The key idea of this paper is to incorporate domain knowledge into the training of neural networks. Specifically, monotonic constraints are proposed to constrain the learning of the non-linear mapping so that physical laws are satisfied. The authors propose two methods to implement monotonicity: hard-MNN and soft-MNN.\n\nHard-MNN treats monotonicity as hard constraints and uses a Monotonic Neural Network to learn the non-linear mapping. Soft-MNN treats monotonicity as soft constraints and adds a monotonic loss into the training objective to encourage the learned mapping to be monotonic.  Experiments show that (1) both the hard-MNN and soft-MM outperforms multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (2) hard-MNN yields lower energy consumption than MLP.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The idea of incorporating domain knowledge into training neural nets is reasonable.  (But this is not a new idea.   E.g.,  \nKG-GAN: Knowledge-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks.)\n\n+ Appendix A.1 does a great job of giving an introduction about cooling systems and chiller plants.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some claims are unjustified.\n\nSection 2 states that \u201cwe make a theoretical analysis and \u2026\u201d However, I cannot find such analysis. Does the theoretical analysis mean Equation 3, 4, and Table 1?\n\nSection 2 states that \u201cCompared with the above state of art method, MNN reduces the dependence on the amount of data, provides a more accurate function space, facilitates subsequent optimization steps and improves optimization performance.\u201d However, the current experimental results are not strong enough to support these four claims.\n\nSpecifically, no experiments empirically compare performance in terms of different amounts of training data. There is no attempt to quantify the so-called \u201ca more accurate function space.\u201d No results show information about the optimization applied to the learned mapping function.\n\n- The technical method is not clearly described.\n\nAppendix A.3 gives an overview of how the energy optimization problem is decoupled into two sub-problems: identification and optimization.\n\nI appreciate the overview but also think there is room for improvement.\n\nThis part could be important since it gives a concrete high-level view of the problem formulation. In particular, this paper concentrates on the first sub-problem. However, it is not evident to see this point neither from the introduction nor from the beginning of the method section, making it hard for me to understand the problem formulation clearly in my first-pass reading.\n\nIn Section 4, three type models are introduced. However, their names and notations are not linked together, which makes the reading very difficult. It would be better if the notations are shown together with their corresponding names like cooling/chilled water pump power model (P_{COWP} and P_{CHWP}), cooling tower power model(P_{CT}), and chiller power model (P_{CH}).\n\nThe connections between math equations are loose, which makes the technical method hard to understand. For example,\n\n(1) the connection between y in Equation 2 and y_{CH} in Equation 4 is not clear.\n(2) The connection between y_{CH} in Equation 4 and x_{CH} in Equation 5 is also not clear enough.\n(3) (c,f_{chiller}(x)) mentioned in Section 4.3 is somewhat isolated, its relationship with the other equations are not evident.\n\nThe last five lines of Section 4.3 (below Figure 4.4) are hard to understand. Overall, the technical writing of Section 4 could be further improved.\n\nFigure 4.1 and 4.4 lack a detailed explanation and thus are hard to understand. What do f_fan, cow_pump, P3, P1+P2+P3 in the figure mean, respectively? What is the difference between (a) and (b)? Why (a) is called identification hyperplane, while (b) is called optimization hyperplane?\n\nMost of the math notations are not explicitly explained in the paragraph. I had difficulty reading the mathematical equations until I found the table of notations in the Appendix (Table 2). However, Table 2 is not referenced throughout the paper.\n\n- Insufficient experiments in terms of setting, details, and comparisons.\n\nThe Experiments section lacks a detailed description of dataset information, training settings, implementation details. The current experiments look impossible to reproduce the results. What is the general introduction of the dataset used in the experiments? Do you split the data into training, validation, and testing set? What is the number of data examples of each subset? How to train the proposed model? What is the detailed network architecture of the MLP and the proposed MNN?\n\nIn the first experiment (Figure 5.1), what is MAPE, and how to calculate it? What is DC mentioned in Figure 5.1?\nThe second experiment (Figure 5.2) is unclear in its purpose, comparison method, metric, and effectiveness.\nIt is hard to judge the effectiveness of the proposed method based on the experiments.\nWhy do we need to consider experimenting with different wet-bulb temperatures?\n\nWhat is the key difference in terms of the experiment setting compared with the previous experiment? The 1st experiment focuses on internal control, while the 2nd experiment focuses on external control?\nCan the authors elaborate more on these two experiments (Figure 5.1 and 5.2)?\nWhat is PUE, and how to calculate it?\nWhat do the dots and lines in Figure 5.2 mean, respectively?\nWhat is MLP with local PID? PID is not explained throughout the paper.\nIs improving the average PUE by 1.5% significant?\nWhy no results of soft-MNN in this experiment?\n\nAs the related work mentioned, \u201clinear regression is the mostly used modeling method in real-world \u2026,\u201d a baseline comparison with linear regression looks essential to let readers know the baseline performance. However, the current manuscript compares with MLP only. Is there any reason that prevents from comparing with linear regression?\n\nThis paper proposes a new activation function (Equation 11) and two extensions of the proposed monotonic neural networks (MNN): partial-MNN and recurrent-MNN.

This can be used to save energy by using the neural network in Model-Based Optimization.\n\nOn the positive side, the paper actually tests a monotonic neural network in MBO on a real chilling plant, dropping the PUE from 2% (from 1.54 to 1.52, e.g.). \n\nOn the negative side, all of the fundamental ideas in the submission are quite old:\n*  The idea of penalizing non-monotonic behavior in neural networks was first published in [1].\n*  The idea of forcing a monotonic structure on a neural network was first published in [2]. The submission references [3], which enforces convexity (not monotonicity).\n*  The idea of using a neural network to predict the energy consumption of a chilling plant was published in [4], although may predate that.\n\nNow the submission does not exactly reproduce these older ideas: e.g., the monotonicity penalty in [1] is quadratic, while in the submission it's either linear, or a log loss mapped through a sigmoid. However, no comparison between these ideas was tested, so it is unclear whether the difference from the old work is significant.\n\nThis paper would be of interest to a small segment of engineers who are interested in optimizing chilling plants. It could be made of wider interest if either (a) some stronger mathematical statements could be made, or (b) if more than one empirical experiment were carried out, perhaps across different types of systems. Perhaps the authors could try a system identification benchmark, e.g., [5]?\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Sill, Joseph, and Yaser S.
