What I can say about it is that it is considerable amount of work, not only implementing the simulator but also looking at what RL methods need, and how to optimize the allocation and exchange of the data so that everything would work on GPU more efficiently.\n\nFrom the practical perspective, I am somewhat confused. The speed-up factors in the experiments are rather modest: about 4x for simulating and rendering frames, 2.5x for full RL, on a single GPU. Better with scaling to multi-GPU systems. In Table 1 the total training time per resources used differs dramatically. However if I look at the lines with A2C it is about the same time with 100-200 CPU cores + 1 GPU versus 12 cores + 1 GPU. So this is about factor 10 in the resources, versus CPU parallelization probably suffering overheads.\n\nIt appears that the maximum steed-ups are achieved for a particular type of the reinforcement learning algorithms, and using it in a general case would give a modest improvement.\n\nThe paper itself consists of introduction, related work, 1 page overview of what it means to simulate the Atari games, and experiments. So it is mostly about measuring the speedups, with several implementations / platforms.\n\nI tend to think that this work will not very much boost the research for new RL methods. It is limited to Atari games, mostly helps to sample-inefficient RL methods and if it helps, the speed-up factors are not of the order that would make experiments by the researchers otherwise impossible. \n\nI would also give priority to theoretical contributions at ICLR. In the end, we all are using CUDA and cnDNN, but presentations about how they implement things are rather given at GPU computing conferences. \n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper448/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper448/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Through GPU Atari Emulation", "authors": ["Steven Dalton", "Michael Garland", "Iuri Frosio"], "authorids": ["sdalton@nvidia.com", "mgarland@nvidia.com", "ifrosio@nvidia.com"], "keywords": ["GPU", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "This paper introduces a new library to emulate Atari games on a GPU and shows its benefits in terms of acceleration and scaling to multiple GPU system, while also providing an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of GPU emulation for RL.", "abstract": "We introduce CuLE (CUDA Learning Environment), a CUDA port of the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for the development of deep reinforcement algorithms.

Therefore we modify the Introduction to better highlight that we introduce CuLE as a tool to \u201cboth investigate and mitigate\u201d the limitations of the existing DRL approaches, including the bottleneck analysis (contribution (1), mentioned as significant by R1), the batching strategy (contribution (2), mentioned as significant by R3), as well as the analysis of the advantages and limitations of GPU-emulation (contribution (3), mentioned as significant by R1) that eventually lead to open research questions (see the Conclusion, mentioned as significant by R3). Our paper follows the track of other works on efficient RL with additional attention to system details (e.g. Babaeizadeh et al. (2016; 2017); Stooke & Abbeel (2018a); Espeholt et al. (2018)) and, more broadly speaking, of many works aimed at making ML computationally efficient, considering not only the algorithmic aspects, but also communication issues and system level optimizations (e.g., Seunghak Lee et al.,  On Model Parallelization and Scheduling Strategies for Distributed Machine Learning, NIPS 14; Peng Jiang et al., A Linear Speedup Analysis of Distributed Deep Learning with Sparse and Quantized Communication, NeurIPS 18; Michael Teng et al., Bayesian Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent, NeurIPS 18; Jianqiao Wangni et al., Gradient Sparsification for Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization, NeurIPS 18; ...).\n\nAs for R2\u2019s point on giving priority to theoretical contributions, we believe that a combination of algorithmic innovations and system research (as in Babaeizadeh et al. (2016; 2017); Stooke & Abbeel (2018a); Espeholt et al. (2018)) is necessary to advance the state of the art in DRL. Coherently with this, we mention in the first paragraph of Related Work the two factors affecting the wall clock convergence time of a DRL algorithm: sample and computational efficiency. R2 notices that \u201cthe maximum speed-ups are achieved for a particular type of reinforcement learning algorithms, and using it (CuLE) in a general case would give a modest improvement,\u201d which is indeed highlighting once more the strong interaction between a DRL algorithm and its implementation, and the need to study these two aspects together. Partially coherently with R2\u2019s claim that CuLE \u201cin a general case would give a modest improvement\u201d, we do show that vanilla A2C does not benefit from CuLE\u2019s high data throughput (see Table 3 and Figure 7), but through an ad hoc batching strategy (Fig. 6) we achieve a 2-4x speed up in terms of convergence time. On the other hand, we believe that CuLE (and GPU emulation/simulation in general) can be beneficial for a wider class of algorithms. We demonstrate (Table 5) that DQN and PPO achieve a significant speed up (in terms of raw frames per second) using CuLE, and almost linear scaling on multiple GPUs (Table 4). Further speed up can be obtained by optimizing the GPU mapping of the TIA kernel (end of the second paragraph, Section 3), or by memory compression (second paragraph, Discussion and Conclusion). Thus we demonstrate that at least the computational efficiency aspect can be improved for different classes of algorithms. The problem of leveraging the high data throughput generated by the GPU using these (and potentially others) algorithms, to achieve high sample efficiency and fast convergence at the same time, remains open, and we believe that CuLE represents a valid tool for future investigations in this direction. To this aim, the Atari suite contains a set of tasks that are sufficiently hard to be non-trivial (as discussed in the Reinforcement Learning Workshop, ICML 2017), and, at the same time, sufficiently simple to be solved in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe magnitude of the speed-up for A2C+V-trace is comparable with results reported in DRL literature - the fact that it is not as impressive as the ones achieved in supervised learning in the last few years, further demonstrates the high complexity of the problem of accelerating DRL, which cannot be regarded as a pure algorithmic problem, but requires the parallel investigation of both the algorithmic and system implementation details.\n\nTo better justify the description of the CuLE\u2019s implementation in Section 3, we add a paragraph at the end of the manuscript to highlight that \u201cCuLE\u2019s implementation is informed by ease of debugging, need for flexibility, and compatibility with standard DRL benchmarks. These choices put a limit on the achievable speed up factor (for instance by using emulation of the Atari 2600 console instead of direct CUDA implementations of Atari games), but the analysis and insights provided in our paper furnish indications for the design of efficient simulators for DRL\u201d.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper448/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper448/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Through GPU Atari Emulation", "authors": ["Steven Dalton", "Michael Garland", "Iuri Frosio"], "authorids": ["sdalton@nvidia.com", "mgarland@nvidia.com", "ifrosio@nvidia.com"], "keywords": ["GPU", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "This paper introduces a new library to emulate Atari games on a GPU and shows its benefits in terms of acceleration and scaling to multiple GPU system, while also providing an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of GPU emulation for RL.", "abstract": "We introduce CuLE (CUDA Learning Environment), a CUDA port of the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for the development of deep reinforcement algorithms.

We thank the reviewer for having raised this point. We modified the caption of Fig. 7 and appended a paragraph to Section 4 to describe how we checked the correctness of our implementation: \u201cTo guarantee that CuLE is compliant with OpenAI Gym, we seed OpenAI Gym and CuLE environments with the same game state and successfully verified that the sequence of game states and frames returned by each environment are equivalent. A more subtle question to answer is if the CuLE reset procedure, based on a set of random initial states, can reduce the variability in the environments and consequently be detrimental for the learning and generalization capability of the trained agents. Our code released in [CULE URL] allows the user to test the training agent on CuLE, CuLE-CPU, and OpenAI Gym environments: in our tests the results are comparable for the three backends. Results reported in Fig. 7} further suggest that CuLE trained agents do not suffer any performance loss when tested on OpenAI Gym environments.\u201d"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper448/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper448/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accelerating Reinforcement Learning Through GPU Atari Emulation", "authors": ["Steven Dalton", "Michael Garland", "Iuri Frosio"], "authorids": ["sdalton@nvidia.com", "mgarland@nvidia.com", "ifrosio@nvidia.com"], "keywords": ["GPU", "reinforcement learning"], "TL;DR": "This paper introduces a new library to emulate Atari games on a GPU and shows its benefits in terms of acceleration and scaling to multiple GPU system, while also providing an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of GPU emulation for RL.", "abstract": "We introduce CuLE (CUDA Learning Environment), a CUDA port of the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for the development of deep reinforcement algorithms.
