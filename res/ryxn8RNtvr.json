We haven\u2019t experimented, but it is similar to a weighted version of SmoothGrad except the local models are not localized to the same point. Hence the resulting interpretation is no longer local. Regarding the choice of LIME, LIME has a few specific benefits many other methods lack: (1) LIME explanations are already somewhat less local than a simple gradient, and (2) LIME doesn't require differentiable input features. Of the two, (1) motivated considering LIME interpretations as candidate local models in the more general aggregation approach.\n\n- Regarding the empirical evaluation, Ibrahim et. al.'s approach is not readily adapted for the task of class-level interpretation and we don't want to attribute our own modification, which may or may not work well, to these researchers. \n\n- For the user experiment, it is necessary to provide a limited number of options for the human user to choose from. Too much information will likely cause information overload and increase the likelihood the workers will stop paying attention after a while. Considering the general unfamiliarity with the notion of feature importance on Mechanical Turk, we choose to remove the negative features in order to avoid information overload and make it a more tractable problem for the participants.\n\nWe believe our selections (NormLIME and LIME, SmoothGrad, VarGrad) for the user experiments are specifically motivated to capture important comparisons with a minimum number of interpretation techniques: by comparing the effect of the aggregation scheme (LIME vs NormLIME), and comparing against SmoothGrad, a standard gradient method that's simple yet highly effective at generating qualitatively \"good\" interpretations. The inclusion of VarGrad is motivated by the finding in \"Evaluating Feature Importance Estimates\" Hooker et. al. 2018 that VarGrad empirically outperforms random importance assignment (whereas many popular interpretability methods fail this benchmark). \n\n- Regarding the novelty of class-level interpretations: Although we are not aware of other works that consider this problem, we don't claim class-level interpretations to be a novel innovation, but merely one approach for recovering some semantic information from the global importance score. As NormLIME does not generate local interpretations, it is more difficult to generate comparison visualizations. We settled on stratifying the dataset by label in order to create a global interpretation problem where we can compare the semantic information captured by different techniques. We motivate label explanations as visualizing the model's approximate representation of each label.\n\n- Contrastive explanations would be appropriate to add to the discussion of similar work in this paper. Thank you for pointing out the relevant literature on contrastive explanations and we will cite it in the next draft. \n\n- Regarding the number of samples of LIME/NormLIME vs SG and VG, this is a mistaken omission. For all explainers in the human user experiments, we generated each class explanation from aggregating n=10 individual interpretations respectively. Even using only 10 local interpretation for each global interpretation we were still able to find that NormLIME aggregation was able to better capture the overall semantic information in the label visualization compared to the other methods based on human evaluation.\n\n- For the evaluation in sec 5, the bottom k% of features are removed (based on the different global explanations), and the resulting drops in performance on retrained models (with the various feature removals) are compared. The global explanations for all baselines (and LIME/NormLIME) are computed with the same number of local explanations.\n\n- Regarding the results indicated in Fig 4(b), it\u2019s not exactly clear what the cause of the difference in results is and is somewhat of an open problem. Our analysis indicates results that seem consistent with previous findings in \"Evaluating Feature Importance Estimates\", Hooker et. al.. Furthermore, we note that SHAP, LIME, and NormLIME outperform the gradient based methods generally. Our general belief is that this has to do with the fact that the non-gradient methods we examined, including NormLIME, operate less locally than the gradient, and so the methods give better global importance estimates. Specifically regarding the difference between (a) and (b), we have an intuitive hypothesis that the redundancy is more clear or less variable in the input than in the convolutional features. Certainly, it\u2019s not exactly clear and is an open problem. We tried to give some insight for our thoughts on why the discrepancy exists, without erring into conjecture."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1152/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1152/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "NormLime: A New Feature Importance Metric for Explaining Deep Neural Networks", "authors": ["Isaac Ahern", "Adam Noack", "Luis Guzman-Nateras", "Dejing Dou", "Boyang Li", "Jun Huan"], "authorids": ["isaac@biofidelic.com", "anoack2@uoregon.edu", "lguzmann@uoregon.edu", "dou@cs.uoregon.edu", "boyangli@baidu.com", "huanjun@baidu.com"], "keywords": ["Machine Learning", "Deep Learning", "Interpretability", "Feature Importance", "Salience"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a new salience map (feature importance function) to generate global interpretations, and evaluate the method both quantitatively using a standard ablation technique, as well as qualitatively through a human user study.", "abstract": "The problem of explaining deep learning models, and model predictions generally, has attracted intensive interest recently.

Once we generate the image we can\u2019t go back through and tune them post hoc. It seems the issue is then deficiencies in tuning the hyperparameters for each interpretation generator for the labels. For this kind of problem though, as the same hyperparameters generate interpretations across all classes, it is difficult for all images to be tuned jointly and visualize well.

Existing interpretable models such as linear regression or decision\ntree-based models lack the power of current neural networks. While investigat-\ning how to train deep learning models with embedded interpretable structure is\nan interesting research avenue, it\u2019s a different and more complex problem than\nwhat we\u2019ve pursued here.\nWe carried out a few experiments that give us intuition this technique will\nwork beyond MNIST. In order to generalize the concept of a global interpre-\ntation to be more meaningful, we explore generating salience map at internal\nlayers. This reduces the impact of requiring translation invariance amongst fea-\ntures. Instead of highlighting the most globally meaningful pixels, it picks out\nthe most useful convolutional feature maps. In fact, our results in Fig 4(b) show\nthat the technique works very well on the convolutional outputs.\nWe believe the difference is due to the normalization of the LIME weights.\nThe normalization we introduce effectively looks at a series of candidate im-\nportance distributions (local models), and averages them after applying locality\nfactors. This turns out to be equivalent roughly to looking at squared impor-\ntance factors modulo some normalization.  We believe this tends to discount\nimportance of features more steeply, which makes it more difficult for a feature\nto be considered \u201cimportant\u201d. I think we observe a strong effect in the human\nevaluation because we look at class interpretations, and other methods are ori-\nented around generating a single local explanation, so they are not as equipped\nfor dealing with aggregating multiple interpretations.\nThank you for your additional comments, however I am not quite sure I\nunderstand. From my understanding it is not quite clear how to apply KAR\nto test the source of the difference in methods. KAR simply proposes that you\nmeasure the performance loss in a model induced by discarding certain features.\nWe applied it to the quantitative evaluation to show that the features retained\nby NormLIME tended to lead to better performance (accuracy) over those from\nother methods. We don\u2019t apply KAR in the human evaluation because it is\ninherently a qualitative evaluation of human perception.\nRegarding the number of samples of LIME / NormLIME vs SG and VG,\nthis is a mistaken omission.

The technical novelty lies in the\nnormalization of the feature weights across local explanations where\nthe proposed scheme utilizes a well-motivated L0 normalization in\nplace of the existing L2 normalization in Ribeiro et al., 2016. The\nsparsity induced by the L0 normalization leads to more \"easy-to-read\"\nglobal (or class level) \"explanations\" since the number of features\nwith non-zero importances is reduced.\n\n\nThe simple idea of generating sparse aggregations of local\nexplanations to obtain global (or class-level) interpretations is well\nmotivated and seems fairly intuitive (and I consider simplicity a\nstrength) and the extremely favourable empirical results, I am leaning\ntowards a reject for the current version of the paper. The main\nreasons for this decision are as follows: \n\n- The proposed scheme is presented as closely tied to LIME, which\n  severely limits the scope of the proposed solution. However, I can\n  imagine that the high level idea of sparse aggregation of local\n  explanations can easily generalize to many local explanation\n  schemes. \n- The empirical evaluation needs to be improved (or better clarified)\n  in my opinion. There are many potential baselines that are also not\n  considered (see details below). Moreover, the evaluation is\n  completely limited to a single data set (which is good as a strawman\n  but not sufficient to make significant claims).\n\n\nClarifications re: baselines and empirical evaluations:\n\n- No comparison to Ibrahim, et al., 2019 -- you can cluster in\n  unsupervised setting but you can also aggregate within class in\n  supervised setting. Generating class-level interpretations is an\n  interesting idea but its novelty is somewhat unclear.\n- In terms of explanations, there are contrastive explanations [1]\n  which are not really discussed in this paper. This scheme could be\n  more useful for generating class level interpretations.\n- It is not clear why the negative correlations were removed in the\n  user study. In certain situations, such as when distinguishing\n  between digits 3 & 8, the absence of weights (potentially\n  corresponding to negative weights) can be crucial explanations.\n- It is not clear why in the SmoothGrad and VarGrad baselines, the\n  class level interpretations are generated with just 10 images per\n  class. Are the class level interpretations of LIME and NormLIME also\n  generated from just 10 images per class. If that is the case, 10\n  seems like a very small number and can potentially create noisy\n  explanations. If LIME and NormLIME used more than 10 images to\n  generate class level interpretations, the comparison does not seem\n  fair. Please explain this discrepancy.\n- For the evaluation in Sec. 5, it is not clear how the features are\n  removed. Are they removed based on the global explanations (feature\n  importances) of each baseline? If this is the case, are the global\n  explanations of each baseline generated using the same amount of\n  local explanations? Please clarify.\n- The KAR analysis results in Fig. 4(b) need to be further\n  investigated. First, it is not clear if this difference between the\n  different baselines something that happens in multiple datasets or\n  just this one. Moreover, it seems natural that something like\n  SmoothGrad and VarGrad would be able to capture the feature\n  redundancies if the redundancies were the actual cause for this\n  marked difference between the relative performances in Fig. 4(a) and\n  4(b). This could definitely use a better discussion.\n\n\n[1] Dhurandhar, Amit, et al. \"Explanations based on the missing:\nTowards contrastive explanations with pertinent negatives.\" Advances\nin Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018.

Will it work on large images where translational invariance is a vital aspect? Will it work on non-image data?\n- Why does this relatively subtle change from LIME create such a dramatic visual difference?

One key aspect that is missing, but hinted at, is where this difference comes from. It could be from the proposed change or from the class-specific information.
