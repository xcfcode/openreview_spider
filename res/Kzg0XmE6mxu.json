Although the general idea is interesting, my main concern is that the approach aims at performing defense against a specific attack. The robustness of the approach w.r.t. other attacks (such as L_2 and L_0) needs to be evaluated.\n\n====\n\nThe paper proposes a robust deep metric learning approach to adversarial attacks. Unlike previous Deep Metric Learning (DML) approaches, the approach focuses on robust optimization-based training that uses a saddle-point formulation. The approach considers the dependence of two classic metric losses (constrastive and triplet-loss) on the samples of a mini-batch to produce adversarial attacks. \nGiven a pair of samples in a mini-batch i and j, a perturbed variant of i wrt j is created as formulated in the first equation of Section 3.4. Depending on whether i and j are similar or not, a perturbation delta in some epsilon-ball increases or decreases the squared Euclidean distance between the representations of i and j. \n\nThe paper then evaluates how classic deep metric learning approaches are robust to Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. The results on some standard datasets show that classic metric learning approaches are very weak to PGD attacks (see Table 1), and the proposed approach is more robust as illustrated in Table 2.\n\nThe paper is well written in general although the experimental section is sometimes hard to follow. It took me some time to understand what the difference between the tables was. \nMy main concern is that only one kind of adversarial attack is considered in the paper. In the second contribution, the authors state that classic DML approaches \"do not have any robustness \u2014 their accuracy drops to close to zero when subjected to PGD attacks that we formulate.\" Classic DML approach are weak to the evaluated adversarial attack, but what about other kinds of adversarial attacks? \nIt is not surprising that a specific method optimized for this attack is more robust. Is the proposed approach robust to other kinds of adversarial attacks?\n\nIf I understand correctly, according to the definition of the distance in Section 3.1, the perturbation delta is performed in the input space of the neural network. How is the argmax/argmin problem solved in Section 3.4? I tried to check the code but only saw inputs perturbed by -epsilon or +epsilon and then clipped. I do not see where the argmax/argmin problem is solved, if the neural network is highly nonconvex, the problem might be hard to solve. This needs a discussion, or at least a reference.\nFor instance, if (x_j, x_i) are dissimilar and x_j is in the epsilon-ball centered at x_i, then rho(x_i, x_j) should be equal to x_j. How can the proposed approach be robust to such a case?\n\nHow does the proposed approach have an impact on the norm of the learned representations?\nCan the authors perform an analysis on the difference of representations between classic DML and the proposed approach?\nWhat about the robustness for a different value of epsilon or type of norm used during training?\n\n\n\n\nMinor comment: The equation in Formulation 1 is confusing because i is used as index twice (once in the sum, and once in the max). Also please keep equation indices for most equations, it makes reviewing easier.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Deep Metric Learning", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Kobber_Panum1", "~Zi_Wang3", "pkan2@cs.wisc.edu", "earlence@cs.wisc.edu", "~Somesh_Jha1"], "authors": ["Thomas Kobber Panum", "Zi Wang", "Pengyu Kan", "Earlence Fernandes", "Somesh Jha"], "keywords": ["Deep metric learning", "adversarial robustness", "adversarial examples", "adversarial perturbations", "adversarial training"], "abstract": "Learning a distance metric between pairs of examples is widely important for various tasks.

The proposed approach is evaluated on several popular metric learning datasets, demonstrating that the method works as intended, and achieves a certain level of robustness, unlike the baseline non-robust model which achieves a very poor performance when exposed to an adversarial attack.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the opening paragraphs of the paper, the authors state \u2018Our key insight is that during an inference-time attack, the positive point in the triplet will be modified by the attacker, and thus, during training, we must perturb positive points in the triplets, instead of anchors or negative points.\u2019, yet towards the end (and despite having motivated it in between), they show that the results on this are inconclusive and that it is not clear that perturbing only the positive points in the triplets is the right / best thing to do. Unless I am misunderstanding something, this feels out of sync - either it is a key insight, or inconclusive? It can\u2019t be both.\n\nOpening paragraphs / under Q1 and Q2 in Section 4 (Experiments) - this feels both redundant (both were mentioned before under Contributions) and also out of place, as it mentions results before even introducing the experimental setup.\n\nThe authors evaluate their proposed robustness approach under a projected gradient descent (PGD) attack. While this is certainly sufficient to establish that the method works and that it provides some level of robustness to adversarial attacks, it feels really limiting to only assess a single attack type, of various options that are available - as it would have been potentially valuable to establish the degree of provided robustness under these different cases. As is, it is unclear whether the proposed approach will be universally helpful, or merely helpful with a particular attack type. While there is no reason to believe in the latter, the former hasn\u2019t been substantiated nor argumented.\n\nApart from the general metrics shown in the tables, there isn\u2019t much additional analysis that would aim to reveal whether there were any patterns in these datasets on where the method worked vs didn\u2019t. For example, was the performance uniform across (pairs of) classes? If not, why? What about contrasting class pairs that are more/less similar? Or are there issues with rare classes?\n\nTables 1, 2 and 3 should include confidence intervals.\n\nThe authors use the phrase significant to qualify differences in several parts of the paper, yet there is no mention of which statistical test has been used to claim statistical significance of the differences? The authors should conduct proper statistical testing and highlight the exact test in the text.\n\nThere is no discussion of the limitations of the current approach / areas for potential improvement and future work in the main paper - instead, some open questions are mentioned in the Appendix. It would be good to include key discussion points in the main body of the paper.\n\nNit: Page 3, when giving lb(A,z) = c_k(A,z) - what if there is more than a single index returned by the argmin - what if there is a tie? The authors should specify if they are doing random tie breaking or taking the majority label (if a multi-way tie)\n\nNit: Figure 4, please update with the finalized results.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Deep Metric Learning", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Kobber_Panum1", "~Zi_Wang3", "pkan2@cs.wisc.edu", "earlence@cs.wisc.edu", "~Somesh_Jha1"], "authors": ["Thomas Kobber Panum", "Zi Wang", "Pengyu Kan", "Earlence Fernandes", "Somesh Jha"], "keywords": ["Deep metric learning", "adversarial robustness", "adversarial examples", "adversarial perturbations", "adversarial training"], "abstract": "Learning a distance metric between pairs of examples is widely important for various tasks.

This methodology is common practice within the field [Goodfellow et al., Biggio et al.]. We have now emphasized more strongly in the paper the found adversarial perturbations are approximation to the argmax.\n\n($P_3$) We have only examined $\\ell_{\\infty}$, however the method is applicable to other common norms used within robust optimization ($\\ell_0$, $\\ell_1$, and $\\ell_2$). We chose $\\ell_\\infty$ as it is widely used within the literature (see [robust-ml.org](https://www.robust-ml.org/defenses/)).  However, as the attack algorithm (now more explicitly covered in the Section 3.4), can be used with common attack methods within adversarial machine learning (PGD, C&W, FGSM, and others), it is not limited to the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm. We include performance measures  for C&W and FGSM (both across naturally-trained DML models and our robustly trained models) in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 7 under $\\ell_\\infty$. Besides, training a robust model resistant to multiple attacks (even only different $\\ell_p$ attacks) is known hard and remains an active research area [Tram\u00e8r and Boneh].

We appreciate you find the paper well-written.\n\n*Using the $P_n$ notation for referencing paragraphs, where $n$ is the paragraph being referenced.*\n\n($P_3$)  We choose to use PGD for its empirically-known ability to create effective adversarial perturbations, and is often seen as *the attack method to beat* [Wong & Rice et al.]. We have experimented with other (often considered weaker) attacks, such as FGSM and C&W. For FGSM we see comparable effects to robustness $\\text{R@1} \\leq 1.0$ and $\\text{mAP@R} \\leq 2.6$ for naturally-trained DML models. We have experienced problems finding suitable hyper-parameters to yield C&W effective under some reasonable running time, when compared to the runtime of PGD. However, this low efficiency is a known problem for the C&W attack, and [the author of C&W  (Carlini) even discouraged the use of the C&W attack for the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm now](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans/issues/978#issuecomment-464594668) (as PGD has become available). **Is there any other attack method, that you particularly you would find relevant beyond the two we mentioned for comparison?**\n\n($P_4$) We solve the argmin using ADAM, as suggested by Roth et al., the argmax through use of PGD [Madry et al.]. The $-\\epsilon, \\epsilon$  you refer to stem from the random seeding step of PGD, that randomly samples a point within the $\\epsilon$-ball, and the clipping stem from \"projection\" (within the $\\epsilon$-ball) that control the perturbed data point cannot escape the $\\epsilon$-ball. We agree that solving this problem for highly non-convex neural networks, in an optimal fashion, is difficult. However, PGD have empirically been efficient at finding effective attacks for highly non-convex networks. The philosophical case of obtaining robustness for two data points ($x_i,x_j$) with intersecting $\\epsilon$-balls is an interesting problem. However, this is a problem tied to limitations of $\\epsilon$-ball robustness that go beyond the field of application within our work (deep metric learning). Achieving $\\epsilon$-ball robustness is (generally) done under the assumption that $\\epsilon$-ball of opposing classes do not intersect, as it invalidates the ability to obtain robustness (as you hinted towards). This problem is often addressed by choosing $\\epsilon$ to be small (in respect to the application domain), such that this occurrence improbable.\n\n\n**References**\n\n[Wong & Rice et al.]: [\"Fast is better than free: Revisiting adversarial training\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03994)\n\n[Madry et al.]: [\"Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Deep Metric Learning", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Kobber_Panum1", "~Zi_Wang3", "pkan2@cs.wisc.edu", "earlence@cs.wisc.edu", "~Somesh_Jha1"], "authors": ["Thomas Kobber Panum", "Zi Wang", "Pengyu Kan", "Earlence Fernandes", "Somesh Jha"], "keywords": ["Deep metric learning", "adversarial robustness", "adversarial examples", "adversarial perturbations", "adversarial training"], "abstract": "Learning a distance metric between pairs of examples is widely important for various tasks.

Consequently, results showcased in experiments have also been updated to align with the new implementation.\n\n1. Mao et al.'s application of triplet loss is effectively to use it as a weighted regularization (weighted by $\\lambda_1$) in combinatorial loss function (see Equation 1 in their publication) for which anchors are adversarial perturbations approximated by maximizing the cross-entropy loss for the classifier undergoing training. To emphasize the key differences to our method: (1) they seek to improve the robustness of traditional classifiers, (2) adversarial perturbations are discovered using cross-entropy loss for the respective classifier, and (3) triplet loss is one of three weighted terms in their loss function for training. We find that the conclusion of `perturbing anchors work well as reported in other work` to be an overstatement, highlighted by the key differences. After rerunning the experiments, after updates to the implementation, Appendix F includes experiments that show robustness can be obtained by perturbing anchor points. However, the experiment suggest that it is more unstable (during training) than the proposed method. We discuss this further in the revised discussion section.\n\n2. Thanks for pointing this uncertainty. It is obtained using PGD (and is similarly obtainable by other common attack methods, C&W, FGSM, etc.). We have emphasized this more strongly in the revision.\n\n3. We have highlighted more strongly that the typical application domain for DML, namely zero-shot learning. Thus, conducting comparisons to traditional classifiers, where the set of classes are identical at train and test time, seems infeasible as this premise does not hold for our application. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Deep Metric Learning", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Kobber_Panum1", "~Zi_Wang3", "pkan2@cs.wisc.edu", "earlence@cs.wisc.edu", "~Somesh_Jha1"], "authors": ["Thomas Kobber Panum", "Zi Wang", "Pengyu Kan", "Earlence Fernandes", "Somesh Jha"], "keywords": ["Deep metric learning", "adversarial robustness", "adversarial examples", "adversarial perturbations", "adversarial training"], "abstract": "Learning a distance metric between pairs of examples is widely important for various tasks.

A robust training framework is proposed. Experiments are performed on standard DML datasets, showing that existing deep metric learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that the proposed training protocol improves their robustness.\n\nPositive points:\n- The topic of rendering deep metric learning robust to adversarial attacks has received little attention in the past, and the results presented in the paper seem indeed novel.\n- The proposed attack and robust training procedure show results consistent with the original PGD attack and the adversarial training based on it.\n- The experiments show clear robustness improvements with the proposed training strategy (although, the performance of the models seems too low for practical use).\n- The code for the submission is provided.\n\nConcerns:\n- The derivation of the proposed robust training framework for DML is a bit unclear. The final optimization objective seems to be stated without much justification as to why it enforces robustness.\n- It would be great to be able to compare the proposed strategy with other results. Maybe R@1 could be compared to [Mao et al.] (cited by the paper)?.\n\nReasons for score:\n\nOverall, I lean towards accepting the paper, as it seems to propose the first results around robust deep metric learning. The topic does seem somewhat relevant to the community. Good practices from the community around strong attacks and adversarial training seem to have been followed.\n\nQuestions / suggestions:\n- How come robust performance on clean data is almost as good as baseline performance (Appendix Tab. 3)?\n\nMinor comments:\n- A few typos remain throughout the paper.\n- Different values of the attack strength $\\epsilon$ do not represent different threat models.\n- Appendix Tab. 3: the bold value for CUB200-2011 with contrastive loss does not seem to reflect the best performance.\n\nReferences:\n[Mao et al.] Metric learning for adversarial robustness, 2019.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3121/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Deep Metric Learning", "authorids": ["~Thomas_Kobber_Panum1", "~Zi_Wang3", "pkan2@cs.wisc.edu", "earlence@cs.wisc.edu", "~Somesh_Jha1"], "authors": ["Thomas Kobber Panum", "Zi Wang", "Pengyu Kan", "Earlence Fernandes", "Somesh Jha"], "keywords": ["Deep metric learning", "adversarial robustness", "adversarial examples", "adversarial perturbations", "adversarial training"], "abstract": "Learning a distance metric between pairs of examples is widely important for various tasks.

They propose a min-max formulation to learn the adversarial example and robust representations, simultaneously. The empirical study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. My concerns are as follows.\n\n1.\tIn this work, authors adopt the positive example rather than anchor in a triplet for perturbation. However, as they illustrated in Section 3.2, the attack only can be applied on anchors while the reference points are fixed. The reason for current choice is that having perturbation on positive example achieves best performance as shown in appendix. But it may be due to the problem in the algorithm or implementation since the behavior of optimizing anchors is weird as reported. Moreover, perturbing anchors work well as reported in other work [2]. The current setting for perturbation is inconsistent with the practical applications.\n2.\tIt is not clear how $\\rho(x_i, x_j)$ is obtained. Is the optimization problem solved to be optimum or just an approximated solution?\n3.\tThere is no baseline from robust optimization for comparison. At least robust triplet loss in [2] can be included. Besides, classification is a strong baseline for metric learning [3].
