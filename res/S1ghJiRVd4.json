A reference set is then used to find mentions of entities in Dc. Finally, both Ds and Dc are combined to retrain the NNER model, which is then used to refine the labeling of Dc.While the second step is about data augmentation, the third and last step is about training the NNER model iteratively. Both steps are repeated K times.\nHowever, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the NNER model is retrained from scratch, or if it is fine-tuned.\nThe authors should give information regarding the setup of their model since they obviously change it from (Genthial, 2017).\nWhile this part is of the paper  was easy to follow, I found the section about the experiments and the discussion of the results much more confusing. The authors report results from 9 experiments in a single table, with a confusing naming, e.g.:\n- what does \"+CRF\" mean? Does it refer to the architecture from (Genthial, 2017) with the CRF layer replaced with a softmax layer?\n- the NNER-3%, why 3% and how did you select this subset of the Bio-ID dataset?\n- Experiments 7 to 9, C1 and C2 are not explained, just mentioned in the caption.\nOverall, Section 4 is really dense and hard to follow. Instead, the authors should consider splitting the explanation for each of their experiments in individual paragraphs.", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper41/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper41/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Biomedical Named Entity Recognition via Reference-Set Augmented Bootstrapping", "authors": ["Joel Mathew", "Shobeir Fakhraei", "Jose Luis Ambite"], "authorids": ["joel@isi.edu", "shobeir@isi.edu", "ambite@isi.edu"], "keywords": ["Name Entity Recognition", "Bootstrapping", "Neural Networks", "Reference Set", "Biomedicine"], "TL;DR": "Augmented bootstrapping approach combining information from a reference set with iterative refinements of soft labels to improve Name Entity Recognition from biomedical literature.", "abstract": "We present a weakly-supervised data augmentation approach to improve Named Entity Recognition (NER) in a challenging domain: extracting biomedical entities (e.g., proteins) from the scientific literature.
