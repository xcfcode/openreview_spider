The GMU learns to decide how modalities influence the activation of the unit using multiplicative gates. The paper collected a large genre dataset from IMDB and showed that GMU gets good performance.\n\nThe proposed approach seems quite interesting, and the audience may expect it can be used in general scenarios beyond movie genre prediction. So it is quite straightforward that the paper should test the algorithm in other applications, which was not done yet. That is the biggest shortcoming of this paper in my opinions.  \n\nAnother concern lies in how to evaluate the performance of information fusion. The abstract claims \"The model improves the macro f-score performance of single-modality models by 30% and 4% with respect to visual and textual information respectively\", however, such an improvement is off the key. If two modals are complementary to each other, the fusion results will always be higher. The key fact is how much better than baselines the proposed GMU is. There is a long list of techniques for fusions, so it is difficult to conduct an impressive comparison on only one real dataset. I think GMU did a nice work on movie dataset, but I would also expect other techniques, including fine-tuning, dropout, distillation may help too.  It would be nice if the author could compare these techniques. \n\nI also hope this paper could talk in more details the connection with mixture-of-expert (MoE) model. Both models are based on the nonlinear gated functions, while both method may suffer from local minimum for optimization on small datasets. I would like more in-depth discussion in their similarity and difference.\n\nTo gain more attention for GMU, I would encourage the author to open-source their code and try more datasets.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gated Multimodal Units for Information Fusion", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model for multimodal learning based on gated neural networks.

I.e. how the equation for h in section 3.1 would look like for multi-modal case. Also what\u2019s the rationale for using tanh nonlinearity (over, say RELU), is it somehow experimentally optimised choice?\n\nI would find interesting a discussion on a possibility of handling missing data in case one or more modalities are unavailable at test time. Is this possible in the current model to back-off to fewer modalities? Synthetic example may suggest that\u2019s in fact possible. Those numbers, perhaps, could be added to table 2.\n\nIn the synthetic experiment, you should compare MGU with the fully-connected MLP model really, with similar complexity - that is - at least two hidden units (as GMU has two such for each modality) followed by logistic regression. At least in terms of capability of drawing decision boundary, those should be comparable.\n\nI think, broader discussion shall be written on the related work associated with mixture of experts models (which is fact are very similar conceptually) as well as multiplicative RNN models [1].

Our comments are embedded below.\n\n\".. the paper should test the algorithm in other applications...\".\n\nWe agree the model should be tested in more applications. However, as stated in another submission related to multimodal learning (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJJ3YU5ge) and to the best of our knowledge, there are not standard multimodal datasets, most of the open multimodal datasets task involves the mapping from one modality to another (e.g. image captioning) rather than finding a way to combining them to improve the performance in the particular task. Indeed, this was the main motivation to build a publicly available dataset. We\u2019ll evaluate another preliminary dataset we have been collecting composed of books with their covers, however we would appreciate any suggestion for other standard dataset to be included as well.\n\n\"Another concern lies in how to evaluate the performance of information fusion. The abstract claims \"The model improves the macro f-score performance of single-modality models by 30% and 4% with respect to visual and textual information respectively\", however, such an improvement is off the key. If two modals are complementary to each other, the fusion results will always be higher. The key fact is how much better than baselines the proposed GMU is.\"\n\nWe agree that the main comparison it is not with single but with multimodal approaches, and thus the abstract should emphasize it. Unfortunately, the phrase you quote was part of one of the first versions of our paper and we missed to update it with our last findings (we\u2019ll update it in the next revision). We compared the model with two early fusion models  (concatenate and linear sum) which have proven to be a good way to combine multimodal features. We also compared with a simpler late fusion strategy (avg_probs). GMU obtained better results in all metric reported for this multilabel task.\n\n\"...I would also expect other techniques, including fine-tuning, dropout, distillation may help too.  It would be nice if the author could compare these techniques.\"\n\nWe initially avoided fine-tuning VGG and the word vectors because it could easily overfit our dataset (~16K training samples Vs. 138M(VGG), 12M (word vectors) of parameters). We included dropout as regularization strategy, but it is not clear for us how can be used as fusion strategy. We'll try fine-tuning both representations and look at distillation as a late fusion strategy.\n \n\"I also hope this paper could talk in more details the connection with mixture-of-expert (MoE) model. Both models are based on the nonlinear gated functions, while both method may suffer from local minimum for optimization on small datasets. I would like more in-depth discussion in their similarity and difference.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll add a more detailed discussion of MoE Vs GMU. We\u2019ll also train the MoE with the best model of each modality, and discuss the results.\n\n\"To gain more attention for GMU, I would encourage the author to open-source their code and try more datasets.\"\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve focused on releasing the dataset, but we also plan to release the code as soon as possible. We want to refactor it so that it could be easy to use and to reproduce these results."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Gated Multimodal Units for Information Fusion", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model for multimodal learning based on gated neural networks.

Following your comment, we've run 1000 synthetic experiments with different random seeds, and the GMU outperformed the logistic regression classifier in 370, while obtaining equal results in the remainder ones. Our goal in these simulations was to show that the model was able to learn a latent variable that determines which modality carries the useful information for the classification, rather than de-noising the input.\n\nWe've tried both PCA and t-sne transformation to plot samples in a 2D space as a visualization strategy, but unfortunately we didn't find such visualizations concluding enough. We argue this visualization is challenging due to the complexity added from the multi-label setup and their correlations between genres.\n\nDuring the training process, we noticed a similar behavior of the GMU in comparison with other units such as convolution filters or fully connected units. Overall, batch normalization considerably helped in terms of training time and convergence, resulting in less sensitivity to hyperparameters such as initialization ranges or learning rate. Also, dropout and max-norm regularization strategies helped to increase the performance at test time.\n\nOur work is closely related to the mixture of experts (MoE) approach [1]. However, the common usage of MoE is focused on combining predictors to address a supervised learning problem [2]. The GMU is proposed as a new component in the representation learning scheme, making it independent from the final task (e.g. classification, regression, unsupervised learning, etc) provided that the defined cost function be differentiable.\n\nFollowing your questions, we\u2019ll do the next changes to the paper:\n  - report the new simulations results.\n  - extend related work section with the MoE discussion.\n  - Include GMU training behavior as explained above.\n  - Similarly to the text length, we'll include histograms for height and width of images.\n\n[1] Jacobs, Robert A., et al. \"Adaptive mixtures of local experts.\" Neural computation 3.1 (1991): 79-87.\n[2] Yuksel, Seniha Esen, Joseph N.
