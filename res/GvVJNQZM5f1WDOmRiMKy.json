Examples of such loss functions\ninclude the classification error, the edit distance and the BLEU\nscore. A common workaround for this\nproblem is to instead optimize a \\emph{surrogate loss}\nfunction, such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge loss. In\norder for this remedy to be effective, it is\nimportant to ensure that minimization of the surrogate loss\nresults in minimization of the task loss, a condition\nthat we call \\emph{consistency with the task loss}.\nIn this work, we propose another method for deriving\ndifferentiable surrogate losses that provably meet this requirement.\nWe focus on the broad class\nof models that define a score for every input-output pair.\nOur idea is that this score can be interpreted as an\nestimate of the task loss, and that the estimation error may \nbe used as a consistent surrogate loss. A distinct feature of\nsuch an approach is that it defines the desirable value of the\nscore for every input-output pair. We use this property \nto design specialized surrogate losses for  Encoder-Decoder\nmodels often used for sequence prediction tasks.\nIn our experiment, we benchmark on the task of speech\nrecognition. Using a new surrogate loss instead of\ncross-entropy to train an Encoder-Decoder speech recognizer\nbrings a significant ~9\\% relative improvement in \nterms of Character Error Rate (CER) in the case when no \nextra corpora are used for language modeling.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/GvVJNQZM5f1WDOmRiMKy.pdf", "paperhash": "bahdanau|task_loss_estimation_for_structured_prediction", "authorids": ["dimbagv@gmail.com"], "conflicts": ["umontreal.ca", "jacobs-university.de"], "authors": ["Dzmitry Bahdanau", "Dmiriy Serdyuk", "Phil\u00e9mon Brakel", "Nan Rosemary Ke", "Jan Chorowski", "Aaron Courville", "Yoshua Bengio"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
