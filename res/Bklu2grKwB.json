Some past approaches for this problem setting have enforced permutation-invariance by construction.  This paper takes a different approach, using a recurrent neural network that passes over the data. The paper proves the network will be permutation invariant when the internal state transition function is associative and commutative.  The paper then focuses on the commutative property by describing a regularization objective that pushes the recurrent network towards becoming commutative.  Experimental results with this regularizer show potentially better performance than DeepSet, another architecture that is designed for permutation invariance.\n\nThe subsequent discussion of the paper raised several concerns with the current version of the paper. The theoretical contributions for full permutation-invariance follow quickly from the prior DeepSet results.  The paper's focus on commutative regularization in the absence of associative regularization is not compelling if the objective is really for permutation invariance.  The experimental results were limited in scope.  These results lacked error bars and an examination of the relevance of associativity. The reviewers also identified several related lines of work which could provide additional context for the results that were missing from the paper.\n\nThis paper is not ready for publication due to the multiple concerns raised by the reviewers.  The paper would become stronger by addressing these concerns, particularly the associativity of the transition function, empirical results, and related work.

There were also simple fixes that the authors could have implemented but they decided not to update the paper. I will keep my original assessment. \n\n--------------\n\nThe premise of the work is very interesting: RNNs that are permutation-invariant. Unfortunately, the paper seems rushed and needs a better justification for not having a RNN memory that is associative. It also should cast the contributions in light of other existing work (not cited). The paper says \"In this section and the remainder of the paper, we focus on the latter [commutative RNN memory operator], namely introducing a constraint (or equivalently, regularizer) that is commutative\", but it never talks about the impact of a RNN memory using a non-associative operator. Being commutative is easy, isn't Equation (2.4) commutative if \\Theta = W? Being associative is hard, since non-linear activations are not easily amenable to associativity.\n\nSection 4: \"The above example demonstrates that RNNs can in some cases be a natural computational model for permutation invariant functions.\" => Janossy pooling (Murphy et al., 2019) gives an alternative way to use RNNs, with a way to make their method tractable. Actually, my guess to why the RNNs experiments work well, even without an associative memory, is because the training examples come in multiple permuted forms, which is the data-augmentation version of the pi-SGD optimization described in Janossy pooling. \n\nOn page 1, \"consider the problem of computing the permutation invariant function f(x_1, . . . , x_n) = max_i x_i\", what follows is not a proof of necessity. It is an informal argument that either should be made formal or should be described as informal.\n\nThere is a lot of missing related work for sets:\nMurphy, Ryan L., Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Vinayak Rao, and Bruno Ribeiro. \"Janossy pooling: Learning deep permutation-invariant functions for variable-size inputs.\" ICLR 2019.\nWagstaff, Edward, Fabian B. Fuchs, Martin Engelcke, Ingmar Posner, and Michael Osborne. \"On the limitations of representing functions on sets.\" ICML 2019.\nLee, Juho, Yoonho Lee, Jungtaek Kim, Adam Kosiorek, Seungjin Choi, and Yee Whye Teh. \"Set Transformer: A Framework for Attention-based Permutation-Invariant Neural Networks.\" ICML 2019.\n\nAlso missing related work for graphs:\nBloem-Reddy, Benjamin, and Yee Whye Teh. \"Probabilistic symmetry and invariant neural networks.\" arXiv:1901.06082 (2019).\nMurphy, Ryan L., Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Vinayak Rao, and Bruno Ribeiro. \"Relational Pooling for Graph Representations.\" ICML 2019.\n\nThe paper has an interesting question but needs to build on prior work. As of now, I am unconvinced that not having an associative operator for the RNN memory will lead to a good nearly permutation invariance function (unless there is data augmentation, per Janossy pooling).\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2542/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2542/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["edocoh@gmail.com", "amir.globerson@gmail.com"], "title": "Learning RNNs with Commutative State Transitions", "authors": ["Edo Cohen-Karlik", "Amir Globerson"], "pdf": "/pdf/c048d777cb9e5f4e2b98684d98060f05bd056ead.pdf", "abstract": "Many machine learning tasks involve analysis of set valued inputs, and thus the learned functions are expected to be permutation invariant.

Authors show on simple tasks their method may outperform DeepSets, the state of the art.\n\n\nAlthough the idea is interesting and the paper reflects thorough work, I believe in its current form results are too weak to deserve publication. More specifically.\n\n1)Mathematical results and statements are mostly trivial and may well be omitted or included as an appendix. They don't seem to convey anything profound (with the exception of theorem 3.6, but this follows from results on deepsets paper). Some of these results are also mostly anectodal \n\n2)The regularization idea seems interesting, but I am concerned it is showing that the final learned networks have a deepset-like architecture: more specifically, theorem 3.6 shows RNN can implement permutation invariant functions by making identifying the parameters with the ones of deepperm. Also, as the authors mentioned, when learning a permutation invariant function then for any degree of regularization the regularization loss can be made zero. So for me, results seem to indicate that the network might have learned a deepperm kind of representation, which equivalently can be expressed as a RNN. Authors should make clear there are fundamental differents between both frameworks\n\n3)Overall, the experimental validation section is weak and an extensive description of network architectures is lacking. Without them it is hard to resolve my concerns on 2).
