The key observation is that the advantage can be computed using 1-step returns, 2-step returns, etc. The paper suggests that, instead of choosing a fixed n, we should aggregate these advantageous together. If the maximum is taken, the resulting policy will be exploratory (i.e., have a \"promotion focus\"); if the minimum advantage is taken, the resulting policy will be risk sensitive (i.e., have a \"regulatory focus\").\n\nThe paper presents results on a number of tasks. A few toy examples show instances where the proposed method works better. Experiments on sparse reward environments show that taking the max advantage provides for exploration that outperforms a baseline (EX2). On a walking talk show that the min-approach can outperform state-of-the-art on-policy RL (PPO); the paper suggests this is because the min-approach is implicitly risk sensitive. Experiments on some of the Mujoco control tasks and some of the Atari games show that taking the advantage with the maximum absolute value performs well, as compared to PPO.\n\nOverall, I think the main contribution of this paper is the finding that there exist smarter ways of computing the advantage. A second contribution is connecting the ideas of risk-sensitive and risk-seeking control with ideas from psychology (regulatory fit theory). \n\nI am leaning towards rejecting this paper. On the one hand, the paper is well written, well motivated, and the experiments quite thorough. On the other hand, I don't think the paper is particularly useful, either from a theory or algorithmic perspective. It is not surprising that if we add an additional hyperparater to an existing RL algorithm and tune that hyperparameter, we'll do better than the existing RL algorithm. The ablation experiments in Fig 6 and Fig 7 suggest that how the advantage estimates are combined, and how they are \"mixed\" with a standard advantage estimate, matter a lot. Further, the fact that using a smaller number of advantage estimates worked better (point #2 on pg 5, Effect of Ensemble Size in Appendix A) suggests that the ensemble size is an important hyperparameter, and that risk-seeking / risk-aversion (i.e., regulatory vs promotion focus) cannot alone explain why the proposed method works. I think that, for this idea to be useful, it must be equipped with a fixed value for these hyperparameters that works well across a wide range of tasks (e.g., a learning rate of 3e-4 works well for Adam on most tasks), or an automated strategy for choosing this hyperparameter (e.g., the automatic entropy tuning in SAC). I would consider increasing my review if either of these were included.\n\nA second concern is that, despite the close connections with risk-sensitive and risk-seeking control (discussed in Section 2), none of these prior works are compared against. Many of these prior works include a temperature parameter for trading off risk-seeking vs risk-aversion (e.g., \\beta in Eq 11 of [Mihatsch 2002]), which is arguably a more transparent (to the user) and easier to analyze (for the RL researcher) than the order statistics used in this paper. Given the wealth of prior work on risk-sensitive and risk-seeking control, I think it's important to know whether these prior methods already solve the problem at hand (choosing between risk-seeking and risk-aversion). I would consider increasing my review if one of these methods were included as a baseline.\n\nMinor comments\n* \"that humans own\" -> \"that humans' own\"\n* The max strategy seems quite closely related to UCB-based exploration. I'd be curious to learn about some discussion on the similarities/differences\n* Fig 6 -- Can you add error bars to show the variance across random seeds?\n* Appendix D -- How does this approach and the results shown in Fig 9 differ from standard GAE? \n\n----------------------- UPDATE AFTER (NO) AUTHOR RESPONSE ----------------------------\nThe authors did not post a response, so I will maintain my vote to \"weak reject\" this paper.

For a given trajectory of n steps, there are n different advantage function estimates: from 1-step to n-step. GAE (Schulman, 2016) proposes to take an exponentially weighted average of these estimates to compute the policy gradients. This paper proposes instead to use order statistics to compute the policy gradient; e.g. the most optimistic estimate, the most pessimistic estimate, or the most extreme estimate.  The paper introduces a regulatory ratio: the probability of using the averaged advantage estimate vs using the order statistic, for computing the policy gradients. This hyper-parameter is justified on the optimistic case (max advantage), as a way to prevent overtly optimistic estimates. The paper conducts experiments on  different domains (sparse and dense rewards, discrete and continuous actions, fully observable and partially observable environments) which show the effect of choosing different order statistics and regulatory ratio on the policy performance.\n\nThis paper could be accepted as it presents an interesting idea with extensive experiments showing where it works and where it fails, along with some justification for the hyperparameter choices.  But there are a couple concerns about the validity of the method.\n\nOne concern is that the regulatory ratio is only justified for the max case, but not for the min or max-abs case. In addition, the choice of regulatory ratio seems to have a wildly varying impact depending on the choice of the order statistic and environment, for which we get little insights from the paper.\n\nAnother concern is that most of the results are reported only for an ensemble of 4 n-step estimators. In the appendix, the papers reports a comparison with a larger ensemble (12 n-steps estimators), which results in lower performance. This is a bit confusing: using the order statistics (max, min and max-abs), and following the reasoning presented in the paper, I would expect that increasing the ensemble size would result in better performance ( the max/min of the 4 ensemble is n upper/lower bound of the max/min of the 12 ensemble). This paper could be improved with more detailed results on the effect of the ensemble size. While the paper provides arguments for why small ensembles might suffice, it does not explain how the ensemble should be chosen, and what would happen as the ensemble size increases.\n\nFinally, the parallels to human psychology are  bit superfluous. I understand how it might serve as an inspiration for algorithm design, but it is a bit distracting from the technical contribution of the paper.\n\nThings to improve:\n\nWhy is max-abs missing from Figure 2?\nDid you try a Rainbow-style training (changing the regulatory focus periodically over training)?\n\nIn some sentences, it looks as if insure was written in place of ensure. In general, this paper would benefit from proof reading by a proficient English speaker."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1759/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1759/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["leilansen@gmail.com", "lizz@sensetime.com", "lixiaoyang@nbu.edu.cn", "qiucong@sensetime.com", "dhlin@ie.cuhk.edu.hk"], "title": "Regulatory Focus: Promotion and Prevention Inclinations in Policy Search", "authors": ["Lanxin Lei", "Zhizhong Li", "Xiaoyang Li", "Cong Qiu", "Dahua Lin"], "pdf": "/pdf/16c27e3567d6b0906779799f61c66e9ecf9a9050.pdf", "TL;DR": "We implemented and tested the regulatory fit theory from psychology in RL using order statistics over path ensembles.", "abstract": "The estimation of advantage is crucial for a number of reinforcement learning algorithms, as it directly influences the choices of future paths. In this work, we propose a family of estimates based on the order statistics over the path ensemble, which allows one to flexibly drive the learning process in a promotion focus or prevention focus. On top of this formulation, we systematically study the impacts of different regulatory focuses. Our findings reveal that regulatory focus, when chosen appropriately, can result in significant benefits. In particular, for the environments with sparse rewards, promotion focus would lead to more efficient exploration of the policy space; while for those where individual actions can have critical impacts, prevention focus is preferable. On various benchmarks, including MuJoCo continuous control, Terrain locomotion, Atari games, and sparse-reward environments, the proposed schemes consistently demonstrate improvement over mainstream methods, not only accelerating the learning process but also obtaining substantial performance gains.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Regulatory Focus", "Promotion and Prevention", "Exploration"], "paperhash": "lei|regulatory_focus_promotion_and_prevention_inclinations_in_policy_search", "original_pdf": "/attachment/16c27e3567d6b0906779799f61c66e9ecf9a9050.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nlei2020regulatory,\ntitle={Regulatory Focus: Promotion and Prevention Inclinations in Policy Search},\nauthor={Lanxin Lei and Zhizhong Li and Xiaoyang Li and Cong Qiu and Dahua Lin},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJefPkSFPr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
