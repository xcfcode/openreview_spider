SDL and \u03b5SC can disagree in their evaluations because they fundamentally measure different things. SDL measures the amount of information in bits that an algorithm has extracted from the data, whereas \u03b5SC measures this quantity in samples. From one perspective, \u03b5SC is simply a coarse approximation to SDL, and in fact for the research setting we encourage the use of SDL.\n\nHowever in practice, which measure is most appropriate depends on the application. SDL measures the additional cost of training a model online instead of ahead of time, and might better reflect the cost structure of continuous training of a deployed model. On the other hand, \u03b5SC measures the number of samples until a model performs well, and might be the correct measure for a company which has to pay for each human annotation of a data point.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2491/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2491/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evaluating representations by the complexity of learning low-loss predictors", "authorids": ["~William_F_Whitney1", "~Min_Jae_Song1", "~David_Brandfonbrener1", "~Jaan_Altosaar1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1"], "authors": ["William F Whitney", "Min Jae Song", "David Brandfonbrener", "Jaan Altosaar", "Kyunghyun Cho"], "keywords": ["representation learning", "representation evaluation", "unsupervised learning", "self-supervised learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of evaluating representations of data for use in solving a downstream task.

We consider it a feature of our measures that they are able to report when there is not enough data to achieve the target loss or rank the representations. In a practical setting, a measure which returns an answer when it does not have sufficient data to do so is a serious liability.

If \u03b5 was set according to our recommendations in Section 4.3 paragraph 2, this indicates that learning an \u03b5-loss predictor is actually harder using this representation than it is using the raw data.

But this in no way makes them all the same. As we explain in Section 3.1, VA and MDL suffer from sensitivity to the size of the evaluation dataset which our methods do not and which is not related to the shared use of the approximation of L(A,i). And as we describe in Section 3.2, mutual information cannot be computed with a finite sample and model. This means that substituting L(A, n) for mutual information is incorrect even for the true value of L(A, n).

We are glad to note that they appreciate our critiques of existing methods. We address specific points from their review below.\n\n**\"replaces an arbitrary dataset size, with an arbitrary loss threshold\"**\n\nOur paper argues that one common goal in representation learning is to achieve good performance with the least data possible. While this is not the goal for every project, it is an important use case that to date lacked good tools for analysis. Our goal is to add a tool to the toolbox of the practitioner.\n\nWe also believe that it is in general easier to know what success looks like (for example, achieving a 5% error rate) than to know how much data it will take to achieve meaningfully good performance. We provide guidance for selecting \u03b5 in Section 4.3.\n\n\n**\u201cwe should understand what is noise, and what is a significant improvement, possibly by computing confidence intervals\u201d**\n\nWe completely agree that noisy measurements are a concern in representation evaluation! Our exposition in the paper uses expected loss throughout, which in our experiments we approximate using 8 bootstrap-sampled datasets and probe initializations to construct every point in Figure 2, and 4 samples per point in Figure 3. Our open-source library similarly computes expected values using many samples. We can add confidence intervals to the plots and tables.\n\n\n**\"a downside of MI is that it ignores computational complexity of the classifiers, but that seems to be a valid complaint of their approach as well\"**\n\nThe issues with the way that MI ignores computational complexity is that the measure is (1) not computable, and (2) has no practical relevance to training a useful model. By contrast, our measures embrace computational limitations: instead of attempting (and failing) to measure  the best performance possible on the task, they measure the performance realizable by a practical algorithm as instantiated by the probe. This is related to V-information [1] or the decodable information bottleneck [2].\n\n[1]: Xu, Y., Zhao, S., Song, J., Stewart, R., & Ermon, S. (2020).

Learning Optimal Representations with the Decodable Information Bottleneck. ArXiv, abs/2009.12789.\n\n\n**\u201cepsilon makes combining evaluations across different tasks difficult\u201d**\n\nIn general, combining evaluations across different tasks is a somewhat subjective enterprise, as losses for different tasks will typically be on different scales. To our understanding, there is not a generally-agreed-upon approach for solving this problem.\n\nFor our methods, we recommend following the protocol described in Section 4.3 paragraph 2: for each task, train a large model on the raw representation of the dataset and use its final loss as \u03b5. This gives a baseline of performance on the raw representation. Using SDL gives a measure of the additional number of bits incurred by transmitting data according to a learning algorithm on representation \u03c6 rather than according to this fully-trained model. \n\nThese measures could be combined into a composite measure of performance in various ways similar to any other score. For example, the SDL measures can be added together, giving a score in terms of \"surplus bits relative to raw baseline\", or each representation could be ranked by how often it outperforms every other.\n\n\n**\u201cit would seem that the approach proposed here would require an arbitrary amount of data\u201d**\n\nIf the loss target \u03b5 is set too low, it may indeed take arbitrarily much data for an algorithm to achieve it, or it may be unreachable.

Leveraging the introduced loss-data curve framework, the paper studies and demonstrates the limitations of the existing methods in terms of their implicit dependency on evaluation dataset size. Motivated by practicality and interpretability of the measures for choosing the best representations, the paper introduces two novel methods, $\\epsilon$ sample complexity ($\\epsilon$SC) and surplus description length (SDL), which are well-motivated and supported both theoretically and empirically. The paper also delivers efficient implementation.\n\nThe paper has excellent motivation and discussion about how existing methods are inconsistent with representation quality, computational complexity and are not robust when evaluation dataset size changes\u2014thus deeming them inapt to answer practical questions. For example, how hard is it to learn a predictor on the given representation? How many samples with given the representation are needed to achieve a specified performance? Is it even possible to reach a specified performance given this representation?\nThe proposed methods are designed to handle these questions and are robust to the evaluation dataset size secured against precipitate decisions on which representation is best. The paper considers the best representation to be the one that allows the most efficient learning of a downstream predictor.\n\nAlthough I do not immediately see weak points, yet the following things should be taken into account when applying the proposed methods \u2014 the assumption of monotonically improving predictors, the dependency of the proposed and existing methods for representation evaluation on the probe design, and potential disagreement between $\\epsilon$SC and SDL (as seen in Figure 3 for $\\epsilon=0.5$).\nAlthough very plausible, the assumption might not hold when there is a sufficient shift between training and validation data. There might be situations when representations may overfit to training data and not reflect properties of validation set points, potentially causing problems in both proposed methods. While dependency on the predictors is addressed in the paper as a separate problem and a direction for future work, it would help if the authors discussed the cases when there is a disagreement between $\\epsilon$SC and SDL.\n\nOverall, this submission seems to be a solid contribution and should be accepted as it rigorously addresses a problem of representation evaluation, which is of broad interest to the ICLR community.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2491/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2491/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evaluating representations by the complexity of learning low-loss predictors", "authorids": ["~William_F_Whitney1", "~Min_Jae_Song1", "~David_Brandfonbrener1", "~Jaan_Altosaar1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1"], "authors": ["William F Whitney", "Min Jae Song", "David Brandfonbrener", "Jaan Altosaar", "Kyunghyun Cho"], "keywords": ["representation learning", "representation evaluation", "unsupervised learning", "self-supervised learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of evaluating representations of data for use in solving a downstream task.

The premise is that conventional metrics for the downstream classifier such as Validation Accuracy, MDL or MI are flawed due to dependence on the size of the dataset (VA, MDL) or because they ignore statistical/computational complexity of the classifier (MI).\nThe alternatives proposed in the paper SDL/\\epsilon-SC, which attempt to measure the complexity of learning the classifier to \\epsilon-tolerance.\n\nThe core premise is reasonable. The metric/evaluation of the representation should not depend on the amount of data available for the downstream task. However, it seems like the proposed alternative replaces an arbitrary dataset size, with an arbitrary loss threshold (small values of \\epsilon may lead no measurement (infinity for both SDL and \\epsilon-SC), while larger values of \\epsilon may also lead to arbitrariness. The authors do say that the they want an evaluation measure which depends on the data distribution, but seem to not pay sufficient attention to the \"distribution\" part (measurements are noisy, and we should understand what is noise, and what is a significant improvement, possibly by computing confidence intervals). The authors specifically mention a downside of MI is that it ignores computational complexity of the classifiers, but that seems to be a valid complaint of their approach as well (presumably more (computationally) complex classifiers can achieve a loss threshold), though their approach does address the issue with statistical complexity. \nThere are other issues - there are typically many tasks that we might want to use a common representation for. The arbitrariness of epsilon makes combining evaluations across different tasks difficult. Further, we typically have a fixed amount of data for each downstream task - it would seem that the approach proposed here would require an arbitrary amount of data for each task, which may not be feasible.\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2491/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2491/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evaluating representations by the complexity of learning low-loss predictors", "authorids": ["~William_F_Whitney1", "~Min_Jae_Song1", "~David_Brandfonbrener1", "~Jaan_Altosaar1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1"], "authors": ["William F Whitney", "Min Jae Song", "David Brandfonbrener", "Jaan Altosaar", "Kyunghyun Cho"], "keywords": ["representation learning", "representation evaluation", "unsupervised learning", "self-supervised learning"], "abstract": "We consider the problem of evaluating representations of data for use in solving a downstream task.
