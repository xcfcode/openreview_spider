Training and development data for supervised training of a binary tweet classifier are collected from influential tweeters with known opinions towards climate change. The trained classifier is then used to classify a larger collection of tweets around natural disasters in the US and its predictions are analyzed, with respect to geolocation and change over time.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting insights into reaction on twitter towards climate change.\n- Comparison of a diverse set of classic binary classification algorithms.\n- Good visualizations and discussion of outcomes, including significance tests.\n\nCons:\n- Data: Is the data made publicly available? How were the influencers chosen? \n- Analysis: It's not clear whether the classifier is reliable enough to draw these conclusions. Examples from the classifications would allow a rough inspection of the quality. If a different classifier would have been chosen, would the conclusions from the analysis still hold? \n- The trick for dealing with unlimited data is not in the focus of this paper and also not evaluated against any other method.\n\nIn summary, I find the analysis of the classified tweets interesting and neat, but my background knowledge on twitter analysis for climate change is too limited to assess whether its novelty. However, possible inaccuracies or biases of the deployed classifier are not discussed and the aspect of learning with limited data is not in the focus of the paper, which makes me question the relevance for this workshop.", "rating": "2: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper21/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper21/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Twitter User Sentiments on Climate Change with Limited Labeled Data", "authors": ["Allison Koenecke", "Jordi Feliu-Fab\u00e0"], "authorids": ["koenecke@stanford.edu", "jfeliu@stanford.edu"], "keywords": ["Climate Change", "Twitter Data", "Sentiment Analysis", "Automated Labelling", "Cohort Analysis"], "TL;DR": "We train RNNs on famous Twitter users to determine whether the general Twitter population is more likely to believe in climate change after a natural disaster.", "abstract": "While it is well-documented that climate change accepters and deniers have become increasingly polarized in the United States over time, there has been no large-scale examination of whether these individuals are prone to changing their opinions as a result of natural external occurrences.

The analysis of sentiment timed with specific events was interesting to see.\nThe paper also identifies specific shortcomings of the current work, which is useful as a pilot experiment and can drive future work.\n\nIt seems unlikely that out of 500 randomly sampled tweets exactly 50.0% were positive and negative.
