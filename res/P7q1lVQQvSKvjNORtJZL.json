These models have\nthe advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy\nobservations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is\nassumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A\nfew highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with\nlinear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures\n(e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general\nrule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models\nis intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling\nfocuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class\nof models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic\nvariational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference\ntechnique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure.\nWe propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior\nthat carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother\nbut, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to\napproximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent\nvariable generative models. We show that our approach recovers\naccurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form\nposteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to\nvariational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for\nspecific non-conjugate models.", "pdf": "/pdf/P7q1lVQQvSKvjNORtJZL.pdf", "paperhash": "archer|black_box_variational_inference_for_state_space_models", "conflicts": ["utexas.edu", "columbia.edu", "stat.columbia.edu", "google.com", "stonybrook.edu"], "authors": ["Evan Archer", "Il Memming Park", "Lars Buesing", "John Cunningham", "Liam Paninski"], "authorids": ["evan@stat.columbia.edu", "memming.park@stonybrook.edu", "lbuesing@google.com", "jpc2181@columbia.edu", "liam@stat.columbia.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
