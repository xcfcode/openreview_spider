The average rate (measured in number of bits per sample) of the encoded feature is defined as the \"complexity\" of the representation method.\nThe author derived the fundamental trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity for any representation-estimation (or encoding-decoding) method.\nThe author also derived a variational representation of the optimal accuracy-complexity region, which also expresses the optimal encoder and decoder map as the solution of the optimization problem.\nFinally, the author considered the case where the joint distribution of P_{X_1,,,,X_K,Y} is unknown, and encoder and decoder are parameterized by neural networks, parameters of which are tuned using data.\n\nI incline to reject the paper, for the following reasons.\n1. The accuracy-complexity trade-off studied in the paper is more of a rate-distortion type of information-theoretic problem, where the joint distribution P_{X_1,,,,X_K,Y} is assumed to be known. Its connection to the learning problem, where the joint distribution P_{X_1,,,,X_K,Y} is unknown, is unclear. Even if the precise accuracy-complexity region is obtained, it says little about the sample complexity needed by a learning algorithm to achieve this region.\n2. Deriving the optimal encoder-decoder mapping from the variational representation of the accuracy-complexity region also requires the joint distribution, which violates the basic assumption of the learning problem.\n3. The author did consider the case where the joint distribution is unknown, and the encoder-decoder pair is learned from data. However, this learning problem is somewhat artificial: each encoder only encodes one of the features, but in order to encode optimally, it has to know the entire joint distribution, hence need to access all the features during training. This discrepancy of seeing different components of the data set during training and inference is not well-motivated.\nThe author mentioned \"multi-view learning\" at the beginning of the paper. It would be good if the author can elaborate more on this problem in Sec 4 of Experiment Results, and discuss with more detail on how the proposed method solves this problem and how it is different from the existing results, both in terms of the algorithm and the performance.\n\n\n\n=================================================\nFeedback to authors' reply\n\nI got a better understanding on how the proposed learning algorithms works after reading the authors' reply.\nI guess the idea for the case where the joint distribution is unknown is that, for encoding, different nodes uses its own training data (without accessing other nodes' data) to optimize the encoder separately; while for decoding, the master node trains the decoder uses data available to all nodes to estimate the joint distribution.\nIn this way, the encoders and the decoder jointly optimizes a variational lower bound of the optimal rate region.\n\nIf this is the case, I think the proposed method may have some value in practice. \nBut now the question is how good the variational lower bound is compared to the optimal region, and how well can this variational lower bound be approximated by neural networks and how efficient can the training be done. Without theoretical analysis on these questions, one may only use experiments to assess the performance. From Table 2, it looks like the improvement of the proposed method on the existing method is quite marginal.\n\nIn summary, I would like to thank the authors' valuable reply. I encourage the authors to study the gap between the variational lower bound and the optimal region, and maybe do more experiments to find a good use case of the proposed method.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1453/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1453/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Information Theoretic Approach to Distributed Representation Learning", "authors": ["Abdellatif Zaidi", "Inaki Estella Aguerri"], "authorids": ["abdellatif.zaidi@u-pem.fr", "inaki.estella@huawei.com"], "keywords": ["Information Bottleneck", "Distributed Learning"], "abstract": "The problem of distributed representation learning is one in which multiple sources of information X1,...,XK are processed separately so as to extract useful information about some statistically correlated ground truth Y.

In summary, this paper proposed a framework for integrating multiple data sources for representing data. In the framework, each data source was mapped to a latent data variable by using a nonlinear function which is called an encoder; then the mapped latent variables were jointly mapped to the target data by using another nonlinear function which is called a decoder. To make this idea to work, the paper used mutual information as the objective function to control the accuracy if the model, and at the same time to avoid overfitting the paper proposed to use MDL as a measure to control the complexity of the model. If I was right, this was the whole picture of the proposed model. My questions are the following:\n1) I am not very clear how the model complexity was automatically incorporated with the objective function. It seems to me that the objective function was finally the equation (29) and then the neural networks for encoder and decoder were optimized. If this was the case, how the model complexity was incorporated, that is, how the R_k was used in the model? Was the values R_k constant in the model - I mean they are fixed constant values? How these values,i.e.,R_k, were chosen?\n2) I am a mathematician, but to be honest, I feel that the Maths in the paper is huge and heavy and I thought it could not be that complex for the model. The consequence is that it make the paper to be hard to read. This is a personal feeling, you could just ignore this point.\n3) Experiments: there are a lot of papers describing to integrate data sources for at least the MNIST example. It would be interesting to compare the proposed method to the literature. The experiment in 4.1 obviously is a toy data problem - I mean although the data is real, but the data generated was using noisy and rotations. It would be more interesting to apply the method to a real-world problem.\n4) I think it would be more friendly to explicitly define the concepts of Discrete Memoryless and Memoryless Vector Gaussian Models. \n5) The Markov chain represented in equation (3) is not well defined. I do not understand these notations. \n6) Before the equation (4), is it equivalent X_k^n and X_{k,n}? I am confused by these notations\n7) In equation (6), it is more readable to explicitly define the Shannon Mutual Information.\n8) The second paragraph on Page 5: you use Gaussian pmfs here, but pmf denotes discrete variable. But Gaussian I assume is continuous."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1453/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1453/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Information Theoretic Approach to Distributed Representation Learning", "authors": ["Abdellatif Zaidi", "Inaki Estella Aguerri"], "authorids": ["abdellatif.zaidi@u-pem.fr", "inaki.estella@huawei.com"], "keywords": ["Information Bottleneck", "Distributed Learning"], "abstract": "The problem of distributed representation learning is one in which multiple sources of information X1,...,XK are processed separately so as to extract useful information about some statistically correlated ground truth Y.
