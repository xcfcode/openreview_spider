By choosing a value of 'p' smaller than 0.5, one can therefore use perform optimization that is 'partially adaptive'.\n - The method shows good empirical performance.\n \nThe paper contains an inaccuracy, which we hope will be solved before the final version. The authors argue that the 1/sqrt(v) term in Adam results in a lower learning rate, and the authors argue that the effective learning rate \"easily explodes\" (section 3) because of this term, and that a \"more aggressive\" learning rate is more appropriate. This last point is false; the value of 1/sqrt(v) can be smaller or larger than 1 depending on the value of 'v', and that a decrease in value of 'p' can result in either an increase or decrease in effective learning rate, depending on the value of v. The value of 'v' is a function of the scale of loss function, which can really be arbitrary. (In case of very high-dimensional predictions, for example, the scale of the loss function is often proportional with the dimensionality of variable to be modeled, which can be arbitrarily large, e.g. in image or video modeling the loss function tends to be of a much larger scale than with classification.)\n\nThe authors promise to include a comparison to AdamW [Loshchilov, 2017] that includes tuning of the weight decay parameter. The lack of this experiments makes it more difficult to make a conclusion regarding the performance relative to AdamW. However, the methods offer potentially orthogonal (and combinable) advantages.\n\n[Loshchilov, 2017] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05101.pdf\n", "recommendation": "Reject", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Padam: Closing the Generalization Gap of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Training Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods, which adopt historical gradient information to automatically adjust the learning rate, despite the nice property of fast convergence, have been observed to generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum in training deep neural networks.

It's well-known that Adam is good at training but might perform badly on the test data. However, Adam performs much worse than SGD in terms of training loss in all plots, which is contrary to my expectation. I doubt that Adam is not tuned well. One possible explanation is that the training budget is not enough, first-order methods typically require 200 epochs to converge. So I suggest the authors training the networks longer (make sure the training loss levels off before the first drop of learning rate.).\n- Mixing the concept of generalization and test performance. Note that generalization performance typically measures the gap between training and test error.

We have added further comparison with AdamW in the revision as you suggested. As you can see from the plots in the revision, AdamW improves the generalization performance comparing with original Adam but there are still generalization gaps left behind, at least in our test settings. In contrast, Padam could achieve basically as good generalization performance as SGD with momentum.\n\n2. Thank you for your suggestion to train longer. We have followed your suggestion and rerun our CIFAR10/CIFAR100 experiments to 200 epochs as you suggested to make sure each baseline is well optimized. In particular, by this way, we successfully reduced the the training error/loss of Adam/Amsgrad to zero. We hope this would clear your concern.\nFor Imagenet experiments, due to the large training test, 100 epochs is more than enough to converge, as can be seen in original papers for VGGNet, ResNet. \n\nRegarding the concept of generalization and test performance, we think generalization error and test error are usually referring to the same thing, while generalization gap is the difference between training error and test error. When we talk about generalization gap, it does not require the training error to be zero. Yet we agree that we should make the training error zero in our experiments, because this is more aligned with the practice of deep learning. Thus we have done that by running the training process for more epochs as you suggested. We hope this addressed your question.\n\n3.  From the convergence analysis we presented for convex optimization, Padam may not outperform Adam, as you said. Yet the convergence analysis in the paper at least guarantees that Padam\u2019s convergence is also not worse, at least as good as Adam. In fact, in a follow up work (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05671), they have proved that the convergence rate of Padam (when 0<p<=1/4) outperforms that Adam for noncovnex optimization.

You are right we indeed need one extra hyperparameter p to achieve the best performance. Yet we think it is more than just another \u201chyperparameter\u201d. Our work has a clear and strong motivation, as we described in the introduction, which is solving the very important generalization gap problem of adaptive gradient methods such as Adam. This is a long standing problem, which prevents the good performance of Adam for training morden deep neural networks. Our solution proposed in this paper has well solved this problem.  \n\nIn terms of how to choose p, we recommend doing binary search over the grid {1/4, 1/8,  1/16}.  We have added this suggestion in the revision. \n\nAs for the cost of tuning one extra parameter, we do not think there will be much trouble. If you think about Adam, which also introduce a new set of parameters (beta1,beta2) compared with its predecessors. Yet people did not complain this for Adam because the choice of these parameters tends to be quite stable and simple. The same applied here, in general case, 1/8 is a quite stable and effective choice of p as we have tested base on extensive experiments. Therefore the tuning process of p does not cost much.\n\n2. As you said, converging faster is just a plus, the key point is that we fix the the generalization gap of adaptive gradient methods for morden deep neural networks. This means a lot, because for small-scale neural networks, people would like to use adaptive gradient methods such as Adam for fast convergence. Now for large-scale deep neural networks, people now can also use adaptive gradient methods (Padam) since the generalization gap issue has been fixed. We believe our contribution in this paper is significant, especially for practitioners who used Adam a lot for small-scale neural networks, but had to give up using Adam for training  morden large-scale neural networks, because of its unappealing generalization gap.\n\n3. We think it is hard to judge the contribution/novelty of one work significant or not based on whether the modification is simple or not. In some sense, Adam is also a simple modification given RMSprop and Adagrad. Yet Adam still stands out given its empirical performances. In this work, we also try to deliver a useful, practical algorithm that could fix a key issue (generalization gap) in existing adaptive gradient methods and therefore, save practitioners from the difficult choice of using SGD or Adam (Now they can all use Padam)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Padam: Closing the Generalization Gap of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Training Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Adaptive gradient methods, which adopt historical gradient information to automatically adjust the learning rate, despite the nice property of fast convergence, have been observed to generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum in training deep neural networks.

It was good to see the experiments use non-MNIST data (e.g. ImageNet, Cifar) and reasonable CNN models (ResNet, VGG).  However, the experimental evaluation is not convincing that this approach will lead to significant improvements in optimizing such modern models in practice.  \n\nOne key concern and flaw in their experimental work, which was not addressed, nor even raised, by the authors as a potential issue, is that their PADAM approach got one extra hyperparameter (p) to tune its performance in their grid search than the competitor optimizers (ADAM, AMSgrad, momentum).  So, it is not at all surprising that given it has one extra parameter, that there will be a setting for p that turns out to be a bit better than 0 or 1/2 for any given data/model setup and weight initialization/trajectory examined.  So at most this paper represents an existence proof that a value of p other than 0 or 1/2 can be best.  It does not provide any guidance on how to find p in a practical way that would lead to wide adoption of PADAM as a replacement for the established competitor optimizers. As Figures 2 and 3 show, momentum ends up converging to as good a solution as PADAM, and so it doesn't seem to matter in the end that PADAM (or ADAM) might seem to converge a bit faster at the very beginning.\n\nThis work might have some value in inspiring follow-on work that could try to make this approach practical, such as adapting p somehow during training to lead to truly significant speedups or better generalization.

These results would suggest practitioners pick up adaptive gradient methods once again for faster training of deep neural networks.", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["jc4zg@virginia.edu", "qgu@cs.ucla.edu"], "authors": ["Jinghui Chen", "Quanquan Gu"], "pdf": "/pdf/bebe4e072efb718a2cb702809a8f9297eb631f4a.pdf", "paperhash": "chen|padam_closing_the_generalization_gap_of_adaptive_gradient_methods_in_training_deep_neural_networks", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nchen2019padam,\ntitle={Padam: Closing the Generalization Gap of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Training Deep Neural Networks},\nauthor={Jinghui Chen and Quanquan Gu},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJll6o09tm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper769/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234380822, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "BJll6o09tm", "replyto": "BJll6o09tm", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335798715, "tmdate": 1552335798715, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper769/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
