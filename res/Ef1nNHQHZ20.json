It further offers an interpretation of the proposed perturbations as ordinary differential equations with the lenses of the operator-splitting theory, resulting in two techniques (either using Lie-Trotter or Strang-Marchuk splits) for approximately computing the perturbations and training the model.\n\n### Novelty and significance\nContrary to what stated in the paper, **layer-wise and gradient-based techniques have already been proposed** and analyzed in the past. For instance, layer-wise and gradient-based perturbations were first proposed in [1] and with a two stage approach, similar to the LT split approximation described here. Also in [2] the authors analyze the link between input perturbations and layer-wise perturbations.\n**The real novelty of the paper is its interpretation of such perturbations on ResNet using ODE, and its link to split decompositions.** \nThis interpretation is interesting and significant as it provides theoretical foundation to the approximation schemes. However **its analysis in comparison with input perturbations falls short**:\n1. it assumes that the model's output and the loss don't change much for small perturbations, which is not satisfied by common architectures, otherwise we wouldn't need to study adversarial examples and defenses;\n2. it doesn't provide insights on why perturbing the intermediate representations improves robustness.\n\n### Experiments\nThe paper carries out several experiments in the white box setting, where **the proposed techniques implemented with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks are shown to improve model robustness** overall and to perform better than methods that are tailored to  improve generic robustness. \nThe setup and results seem sound and the study of the perturbation scale $\\eta$ is useful.\nOf course, also in the experiments the proposed methods should be compared to existing gradient-based and layer-wise defenses that have been ignored.\nFinally, it's not clear from the main text why the SM approximation works better than the LT one in practice.\n\n### Quality and clarity\nThe paper is generally well written. It sometimes lacks of mathematical rigor and some important notations are missing:\n1. In Problem (1) $L$ and $f$ are not defined and it should be clearly stated that the formulation is specific to ResNets. \n2. In Equation (6) $\\hat{x}$ is not defined. \n3. $x$ and $\\widetilde{x}$ are interchangeably used across the paper for original or perturbed inputs, which is confusing.\n\n[1] Sankaranarayanan, Swami, et al. \"Regularizing deep networks using efficient layerwise adversarial training.\" AAAI (2017)\n[2] Chen, Xiaoyi and N.

It further analyses the perturbed dynamics from the perspective of ODE, and proposes two implementations based on different numerical schemes. These algorithms are empirically tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.\n\nI think this paper contains many interesting ideas, but they are not yet presented as a coherent story. In addition, the empirical results are not convincing enough to justify the authors claims. Therefore, I think the ideas here need further development before the paper can be accepted at ICLR.\n\nPros\n1. This paper is overall clearly written, and provides enough background material on numerical analysis.\n2. The ODE-based analysis is interesting, and this direction may provide further insight into related work.\n\nCons\n1. A major problem is that the layer-wise perturbation is not well motivated and justified. Since adversarial attacks are only performed on the inputs, it is unclear to me why perturbing all hidden layers is necessary (deemed \u201cessential\u201d in multiple places in the paper) for the defense.  E.g., would hidden representations adapt from input perturbation through training?\n2. The analysis, although interesting, is a bit handwavy. For example, why the last term in eq. 10 \u201ccan be negligible\u201d? This claim needs to be justified by either proofs or numerical simulation that shows this term is indeed much smaller than others. In addition, what does the conclusion (\u201cthe main difference \u2026 lies in the first order initial values\u201d) imply, and can it be experimentally verified?\n3. The empirical results are not convincing enough. First, the reported numbers were averaged from 3 random seeds, while the deviations were not given. This is problematic given that the improvements from LAD or LAD-SM are relatively small -- without the standard deviation, it is difficult to evaluate their significance. In addition, as an extension of input perturbation, is LAD(-SM) comparable with PGD? It would be helpful to show columns cross Table 1, 2 and 3 with the same attack radii for such comparison.\n\nOther comments\n\nThe comparison of different splitting schemes is interesting, but it is unclear why the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme should be better in practice, since the ODE (eq. 7) is obtained from the limit of a discrete system. The experiments indeed show that LAD-SM was not superior in many cases.

Overall, it reads well. If the pseudocode of the two proposed methods is provided, it would be easier to understand the proposed schemes. The authors may save some space leaving out the proof of Theorem 3.3.\n \nStrengths/Quality/Significance (pros):\nThe authors studied an interesting construction. The proposed methods show that the adversarial training can be generalized to hidden representations.

The authors did not show the efficiency of the proposed methods.

If authors tighten the loose end and bridge between the optimization problem and ODE-inspired numerical schemes, it will be more useful. Unlike the input space (image space), it is much trickier to define small perturbations to preserve the labels of samples. If the authors can fill this gap, it might be possible to provide a new definition of adversarial attacks.\n \nIt is confusing. In Figure 2, the smallest number (ratio) looks smaller than 10^5, unlike the discussion.

Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmarks show that our methods consistently improve adversarial model robustness on top of widely-used strong adversarial training techniques.

It is essential to enhance the adversarial model robustness by stabilizing both inputs and hidden layers. The proposed method leveraged two operator splitting theory w.r.t. the Lie-Trotter and the Strang-Marchuk splitting schemes to discretize the specially designed ODE formulation by integrating the continuous limit of back-propagated gradients into the forward process. The main contribution of this paper is to generate perturbations with the idea of ODE in each layer. Empirical studies were performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmarks with two attack methods.\n\nThere are several concerns suggesting that this paper may not be accepted at its current form.\n1.\tNovelty is a concern. \na)\tTo improve the limitation that the existing adversarial training approaches mainly focus on perturbations to inputs, this paper added perturbations in each hidden layer with the ODE perspective, which is not convincing enough to me. \nb)\tThe authors did not state the significance compared with  the other layer-wise perturbation methods. Why it is efficient to use the ODE method adding perturbation in each layer. \nc)\tAt least, the authors should compare with the other adversarial training methods in a layer-wise way, e.g. the following two references.\n\nRef1.

As for the defense against attack method, this paper just used FGSM and IFGSM which are quite weak attacking methods. The proposed method may also be compared under strong attack methods, such as PGD and CW methods, since this paper targets defense. \nb)\tFurthermore, the results may not be significantly enough to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nc)\tIn Table1, did you use the same ResNet with the baseline, ResNet-110 or ResNet-164? It appears that the results in the paper are quite different from those reported in the original paper of Yang et al.\n3.\tThe authors mentioned that they leveraged a two-stage approach to solve the time-consuming problem during training in section 3.1. There are not clear descriptions about this approach how it works and the authors did not explain why it could save time.\n4.\tIn equation (1) and (5), some notations of x are different from each other. The authors did not give clear annotation which is confusing to me. The function f is not defined as well.\n5.\tIn the experimental part, the authors did not conduct black-box experiments which are import in adversarial training.\n6.\tThe paper could be further polished.

On improving model robustness, the adversarial training techniques have proven effective and gained increasing attention from research communities. Existing adversarial training approaches mainly focus on perturbations to inputs, while the effect of the perturbations in hidden layers remains underexplored. In this work, we propose layer-wise adversarial defense which improves adversarial training by a noticeable margin. The basic idea of our method is to strengthen all of the hidden layers with perturbations that are proportional to the back-propagated gradients.
