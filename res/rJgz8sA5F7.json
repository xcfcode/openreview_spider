The major comparison in this paper was between the Packnet and ours. We wanted to emphasize that our model can avoid catastrophic forgetting and 'also' can expand if needed. We agree that we should have been careful in writing the contribution.\n\n2. (a) Maybe there was a misunderstanding in this part. The overall architectures are the same in all experimental settings(EWC, LwF, Packnet and ours). So we are not giving more capacity to our network but efficiently distributing the capacity to each task just like the Packnet. In other words, we do not expand the c-net capacity compared to the baseline network.\nAs we are not using the full Imagenet dataset, we believe that the result in Table 3 may be different with the full dataset result. We assumed that Resnet-50 is enough to show the properties of our method.\n\n(b) We agree with your opinion about EWC and we are willing to remove it from the paper.

NIPS 2016] (unfortunately, not cited) where the task id is not given at test time. This is inferred by a battery of classifiers trained on data produced by generative models trained on task specific data.\nThe authors argue strong connections to similar mechanisms in the human brain and demonstrate this method on a stream of 2 or 3 vision tasks. However, the interpretation of these results is dubious.\n\nNovelty: given prior work on Progressive Nets and other methods using generative models for continual learning, novelty is limited.\n\nRelevance: the motivation and aim of this work is certainly relevant for ICLR.\n\nClarity: the paper is overall clear, although it needs a bit of rewriting to improve fluency (see for instance sec. 3.4.1).\n\nReferences: the authors should definitely cite Progressive Networks and their extension \"Progress and Compress\" (Schwarz ICML 2018), as their approach is an extension of the former with the only difference that the task id is inferred at test time by using a battery of binary classifiers.\n\nEmpirical validation: The empirical validation is limited because of:\na) lack of comparison to Progressive Nets, \nb) lack of simple baselines (e.g., how about replacing H-Net with an inference process like task_id = argmin_i=1..T loss(C-Net, task = i) ),\nc) unclear interpretation of the provided results (how can the accuracy on MNIST be 100%? are the authors reporting training accuracy?)\nd) very limited number of tasks considered (up to 3)\n\nGeneral comments\nMajor drawbacks of the proposed approach are: 1) training on new tasks can never improve performance on past tasks (unlike other methods like GEM (Lopez-Paz et al. NIPS 2017), 2) the number of parameters grow linearly with the number of tasks (an issue addressed by the Progress and Compress paper above), and 3) the overall approach is not efficient as it requires lots of data from each task in order to train the generative models.\nFinally, I think all the connections and inspiration from how the human brain works should be toned down.

It is relatively easy to understand the paper. \n2. The originality of this paper lies in the usage of generative model to predict task id (H-Net). To my knowledge has not been proposed before.\n3. In contrast to previous works in multi-task learning, which assumes task id is available both during training and inference, this work tries to remove the need of task id during inference, which makes it closer to the general definition of continual learning.\n\nCons:\n1. Expanding the network for new tasks is not a novel contribution of this paper, it has already been proposed in previous works on multi-task learning. Doing expansion on all of the layers does not qualify for a major contribution in my opinion.\n2. The experimental comparison is not very fair in my opinion, \n     a. Comparing accuracy of C-Net to other methods is not very useful. Because this methods expands the network for every new task, while other methods (EWC, LwF) has limited to no expansion in the network. Given that the single network result is far from state of the art (table 3), I suppose model size could contribute to the accuracy boost.\n     b. It is not explicitly stated in the paper whether the output neurons are shared between tasks or an individual set of output neurons are used for different tasks, but from the rest of the paper I suppose disjoint neurons are used. Then the comparison between EWC and this work is not fair because EWC shares the output neurons among tasks.\nThis is not to blame this paper for not making fair comparison, since given different assumptions between methods (availability of task id, shared output neurons etc.), it is usually difficult to fairly compare between continual learning methods.  This problem is raised in another submission https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByGVui0ctm. The point here is that the accuracy of C-Net is not a good measure of how good this method is.\n3. I disagree with the point that MNIST and SVHN are similar, they have very different distributions and are very easy to tell apart with a model. One concern is that the generative H-Net may fail to work once the distributions of the tasks overlap to some extent. e.g. cifar10 vs cifar100.\n\nAs a conclusion, the key contribution of this work is using generative model to determine task id which removes the need for task id during inference.

This usually leads to the catastrophic forgetting problem which is inevitable for the traditional training methodology of neural networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a memory-based continual learning method that is able to learn additional tasks while retaining the performance of previously learned tasks.\nComposed of two complementary networks, the Hippocampus-Net (H-Net) and the Cortex-Net (C-Net), our model estimates the index of the corresponding task for an input sample and utilizes a particular portion of itself with the estimated index.\nThe C-Net guarantees no degradation in the performance of the previously learned tasks and the H-Net shows high confidence in finding the origin of an input sample.", "keywords": ["continual learning", "lifelong learning", "catastrophic forgetting"], "authorids": ["kjh91@snu.ac.kr", "kimjiss0305@snu.ac.kr", "nojunk@snu.ac.kr"], "authors": ["Jangho Kim", "Jeesoo Kim", "Nojun Kwak"], "TL;DR": "In this paper, we propose a network which efficiently increases its complexity without degrading the performance of previous tasks inspired by the brain system of human being", "pdf": "/pdf/44ed1c6d0ab6a71190c565c1794c37975bc36b22.pdf", "paperhash": "kim|hcnet_memorybased_incremental_dualnetwork_system_for_continual_learning", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkim2019hcnet,\ntitle={{HC}-Net: Memory-based Incremental Dual-Network System for Continual learning},\nauthor={Jangho Kim and Jeesoo Kim and Nojun Kwak},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJgz8sA5F7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper152/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234526676, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "rJgz8sA5F7", "replyto": "rJgz8sA5F7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper152/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335660431, "tmdate": 1552335660431, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper152/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
