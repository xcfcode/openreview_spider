We now consistently refer to T(V) as the free algebra in the revised version. We assume readers will be familiar with tensors and how to multiply tensors with the usual outer product. The definition of T(V) and the tensor convolution product is then simple: it\u2019s just the space of sequences of tensors and the convolution product is given by a simple sum, equation (5). We introduce this at the bottom of p2 and refer to the Appendix for general background on tensors and more details and examples. Please let us know if this clarifies it. \n\n> (...) citation to existing works in the first two pages (...) \n\nWe placed the literature review in Section 6 under related work. This is somewhat less common than putting right after the introduction but we thought it fits better there. However, we are also happy to put it in Section 1. \n\nAs for novelty, the free algebra with the convolution tensor product is a classical and well-known structure in pure mathematics. Analogously, the use of tensors with the outer tensor product is very popular in ML. In our opinion, the main contribution of this paper, is to show that replacing the outer tensor product with the convolutional tensor product has many advantages, both theoretical and empirical, and that it can be done in an algorithmically efficient way, see Section 6 for a summary.\n\n\n> (...) after stating the problem of interest, the authors start describing the contributions immediately (...)\n\nSee our answer above for the theory contribution. For the empirical contribution, we give the precise reference and benchmarks for each experiment in Section 5. \n\n> (...) The name Seq2Tens is not properly defined (...) \n\nThanks, the term Seq2Tens is now properly defined on page 2 below equation 2. It is the name of the feature map $\\Phi$.\n\n> (...) Section 2 is quite abstract and mathematically (...)\n\nWe agree and as a response we have considerably revised Section 2 to better explain the key ideas and give intuition by drawing parallels to m-mers subpatterns as used in string kernels. We agree that basic knowledge of tensors is necessary but this is the case for many papers in ML. Nevertheless we give background on tensors with examples in Appendix A. Please let us know if this is more accessible now for someone with less of a math background or where you see more room for improvement. \n\n> (...) the degree m is defined to be m>=0 (...) user-defined hyperparameter (...) maximum value for m to take (...) how to determine it in practice (...)\n\nYes, this is a hyperparameter. The degree $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$, as we denote it now in the revised version is called the order of the Seq2Tens layer, and it determines the longest non-contiguous subsequence of the input sequence that the transformation operates on (see eq.8 and 12). The longest subsequence of a sequence $\\mathbf{x}=(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_L)$ is itself, therefore $M \\leq L$. We have now added Remark 2.3 that clarifies this.\n Intuitively, we think of the order as being analogous to the degree of polynomials over vector-valued data, and we experimentally found that it is best kept at a small value ($M \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$). Instead of increasing $M$ further, it is most beneficial to increase the depth instead. Also, see our response to Reviewer 4, Question 2 regarding our intuition for the connection between width, order and depth.\n\n> (...) Notations are not standard or consistent (...)\n\nThanks for pointing these out! We have fixed the subscript issue and now denote an element of $V^{\\otimes m}$ by either $\\ell_m$ or a subscripted boldfont variable $\\mathbf{t_m}$, while the elements of $T(V)$ are either denoted by $\\ell$ or a boldfont variable $\\mathbf{t}$. We believe the notation $\\ell$ is not inconsistent, and that it improves clarity. Many books and papers denote a linear functional by $\\ell$, and we use $\\ell_m \\in V^{\\otimes m}$ or $\\ell \\in T(V)$ to emphasize when it is used as a representer of a linear functional on $V^{\\otimes m}$ or $T(V)$. \n\n> (...) the right hand side is a capital V without bold, which I assume is a tensor (...)\n\nThe capital V denotes a vector space. First sentence of \u201cSeq2Tens in a nutshell\u201d paragraph: \"Given any vector space V we may construct the so-called free algebra T(V) over V.\"\n\n> (...) Acronyms are not always defined before use (...)\n\nThanks, we have now fixed this.\n\n\n(Continued next)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3363/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3363/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Seq2Tens: An Efficient Representation of Sequences by Low-Rank Tensor Projections", "authorids": ["~Csaba_Toth2", "~Patric_Bonnier1", "~Harald_Oberhauser1"], "authors": ["Csaba Toth", "Patric Bonnier", "Harald Oberhauser"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Sequential data such as time series, video, or text can be challenging to analyse as the ordered structure gives rise to complex dependencies.

Section 4 refers too frequent to the appendix and it does not seem to be self-contained (...)\n\nWe refer to our answer to Reviewer 1, Question 3. This is unavoidable to a certain extent since the paper contains both substantial theoretical and experimental content. We tried to address this as much as possible in the revised version by focusing on the main ideas and addressing the reviewers questions in the main text with precise references to the details in the appendix and the cited papers.\n\n> (...) any hyperparameter to set (...) demonstration of convergence and sensitivity (...)\n\nYes, there is; we have now added in Section 5 (previously Section 4) the hyperparameter choices that we considered. So far there is no study of sensitivity in the paper, however, we can add such an analysis in the appendix for one of the TSC datasets before the end of the rebuttal period.\n\n> (...) vast literature on tensor-based models (...)\n\n Indeed there is a vast literature on tensor based models, however, most of these papers are either purely theoretical or their applications are domain specific (e.g. tensor fusion). Ours is a general construction that we demonstrated to work well on a wide range of tasks. We would like to emphasize that we don't explicitly compare against tensor based models, because we benchmark against the best performing models for each given task and dataset. This is a much stronger result.\n\n> (...) sequence tensor gait recognition (...)\n\nWe notice that gait recognition is a big area in computer vision and most papers are written with this single task in mind with either huge representation pipelines or highly specialized considerations. Hence, we believe this is outside of the scope of this current work. Nevertheless, we added a citation in the Related work paragraph.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that the benchmarks we have chosen are very popular.

However, it can be cast into a recursive formulation over time that allows us to devise efficient dynamic programming algorithms. This is discussed in Appendices D2, D3 and D4.

Hence, we found that performance was similar between order $M=2$, depth $D=3$ and $M=3$, $D=2$ , but using $M=8$ and $D=1$ performed significantly worse overall. We suggest that this is because depth does not only increase the combined \u201ceffective\u201d order, but also compensates for the maximal rank of the low-rank functionals, which is represented by the width parameter $N$ (ending up being completely analogous to the classical width vs depth trade-off in NN).

Regarding the main criticism, \n\n> (...) experiments have to be larger and considering trickier tasks such as language processing related experiments (speech recognition, language modelling, etc.) (...)\n\nWe would like to raise the following points:\n\n_Classification_: the multivariate time series classification archive that we use has become a de-facto standard for time series classification papers. Time series classification is a very large community with many competitive models. For example, the recent and highly cited survey (Fawaz et al 2018, Section 4.1.2) exclusively benchmarks multivariate time series classifiers on this archive. Although the archive is not perfect, it contains datasets from various application domains such as motion, speech, handwriting, etc. as well as time series of various length and dimensions. It makes a challenging and widely used benchmark as witnessed by the cited publications that propose highly specialized architectures to just address this task.  \n\n_Generative modelling_: these datasets are very popular in the TS imputation and generative modelling communities. A detailed description of the model and analysis of the experiment is given in Appendix E.2. The GP-VAE is a highly complicated model that builds on advanced concepts such as variational inference, Gaussian processes and several previous works on VAEs, and although we have done our best effort to do so, it is impossible to compress all that work into a few paragraphs. Nevertheless, it is exactly this highly complicated nature of the GP-VAE that the experiment demonstrates the modularity and flexibility of the Seq2Tens map; we were able to improve the performance of a highly complicated model composed of many interacting submodels by the naive plug-in application of our Seq2Tens layer.\n\nWe do share the reviewer's enthusiasm about the potential of Seq2Tens in \u201clanguage modelling, etc\u201d. However, this usually involves very large pipelines with many preprocessing steps and hyperparameters. Applying Seq2Tens in a language model would in our view require a whole paper and partly also address a different target audience. To address the reviewers concerns we have now added a new mortality prediction task, the Physionet 2012 challenge in Section 5.2. This is well-known as a \"trickier task\" for several reasons 1) missing values in the time series due to irregular and asynchronous sampling, 2) unbalanced class distribution, 3) low signal-to-noise ratio. Again the performance is very strong and competes against recent SOTA methods published in venues like ICML2020, etc.\n\nFinally, a general remark that we should have emphasized more: our primary aim in the experiment section is to demonstrate that using an algebraic structure that is well-known in mathematics but not in ML, the free algebra T(V), yields many benefits; both theoretical and empirical. Further, we show that this can be achieved at little or no additional computational cost, and done in a straightforward and modular way: a vanilla FCN upgraded with Seq2Tens layers beats highly specialized modelsfor time series classification; a popular generative model gets significant performance gains just by adding Seq2Tens layers. That the performance on widely used benchmarks is lifted to SOTA is a nice effect, but should not be the central takeaway of the paper. \n\n> (...) TSC classification task are located with moderate or high prior (> 0.6). Moreover, the experiments are conduced with both small models and datasets\n\nThis is not what Table 1 shows: firstly, it shows the posterior (not prior) and, secondly, that our FCN-LS2T^3 beats all of the other models with high-posterior probability, except MLSTMFCN which is slightly beaten by it. Some of the benchmark models are \u201csmall\u201d, but not all of them (eg. ResNet and MLSTMFCN). Ultimately the performance matters, and these are the best performing models (see Fawaz et al, 2018). Regarding the size of data sets, we do not consider the video data Sprites, the health data Physionet, and some of the time-series in the classification experiment as small.\n\nPlease let us know if this addresses your concerns.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3363/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3363/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Seq2Tens: An Efficient Representation of Sequences by Low-Rank Tensor Projections", "authorids": ["~Csaba_Toth2", "~Patric_Bonnier1", "~Harald_Oberhauser1"], "authors": ["Csaba Toth", "Patric Bonnier", "Harald Oberhauser"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Sequential data such as time series, video, or text can be challenging to analyse as the ordered structure gives rise to complex dependencies.

The proposed model can be plugged into existing state-of-the-art neural network models as Seq2Tens layers to improve the performance, which has been demonstrated on several benchmark datasets in this paper. \n\nOn one hand, there are some solid contributions made in this paper. On the other hand, I do find it is difficult for the readers to appreciate its merits. Please see my detailed comments below.\n\n1. Possibly due to my limited mathematically background, \"the free algebra\" in the abstract of the PDF paper is a jargon for me (and possibly other AI/ML readers). Although I could google and learn from Wiki, I am not sure whether it is necessary. In the text abstract online, the authors use \"the tensor algebra\" in the online abstract of this paper.  Are they interchangeable? Which one is more appropriate? \n\n2. There is no citation to existing works in the first two pages, including the Introduction section. In fact, there is only one citation (on page 3) on the universality in the first three pages of this paper. Does this mean that all other materials are original? Because I am not familiar with so called free algebra, I expect some references to be provided. \n\n3. In the Introduction, after stating the problem of interest, the authors start describing the contributions immediately, without mentioning any existing approaches to solve the problems and giving proper context in judging or appreciating the claimed contributions.\n\n4. The name Seq2Tens is not properly defined, although I can tell it means \"sequence to tensors\". In fact, in the second paragraph on contributions in Sec. 1 Introduction, the authors did not mention the word \"tensor\" at all.\n\n5. Section 2 is quite abstract and mathematically, providing some visual illustrations will make the readers' life easier (e.g. cutting example frames in Fig. 3).\n\n6. Equation (3), the degree m is defined to be m>=0. Is it a user-defined hyperparameter? Is there a maximum value for m to take? If yes, what is it and how to determine it in practice? If not, does it mean that m can go to infinity (not likely)?\n\n7. Notations are not standard or consistent. A matrix is denoted as \\mathbf(t)_2 and a 3rd-order tensor as \\mathbf(t)_3, but the authors also use \\mathbf(t) without subscript, in which case I am wondering what is the order (or degree in the authors' chosen terminology). Then in Equation (7), the authors use a non-bold font ell to represent a tensor. In the equation between (1) and (2) (defining Seq2Tens), the right hand side is a capital V without bold, which I assume is a tensor. \n\n8. Acronyms are not always defined before use, e.g. TSC appears in Fig. 1 caption on page 5, but it is only defined on page 6. \n\n9. Section 4 refers too frequent to the appendix and it does not seem to be self-contained. Essential information about the data is missing so readers have to navigate through the 21-page appendix to find information necessary for them to appreciate the methods. \n\n10. Is there any hyperparameter to set? Is there a demonstration of convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings? \n\n11. In Related work, the authors pointed out the vast literature on tensor-based models. However, there is no comparison against any of them. For example, many tensor-based machine learning algorithms have been applied to gait sequences for gait recognition so they model sequences as tensors too (google \"sequence tensor gait recognition\" w/o quote). These related works should be evaluated against the proposed model, many with public code available. \n\n12. As mentioned above, with many important information put in the appendix, I think the 18 frames displayed in Fig. 3 are more important than those essential information about the data, hyperparameter setting, etc. I am not sure whether human eyes can tell the improvements achieved in much less than 0.001 in MSE on Sprites and whether it matters in practice.

The proposed method has attractive theoretical property, such as preserving universality of static feature mapping, and convergence in the continuous setting. The author further proposes using stacked rank-1 projection of the free algebra as an approximation to the sequence representation in order to make it computationally feasible neural networks layers. The author illustrated the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method by combining the NN implementation with FCN to benchmark on multivariate time series classification problem, and GP-VAE model to benchmark on sequential data imputation problem. The proposed methods shows improved results over previous state-of-the-art. \n\n\nSignificance: This paper provides the community an extension of the universal approximation theorem of NN on sequential data, as well as a generic method to transform static feature maps into sequence features. The experiment shows the proposed method and its implementation is flexible and effective in both discriminative and generative problems. Some questions/feedback: 1. In Proposition 2.3, while the rank-1 projection makes the method computationally feasible, taking sum over all non-contiguous subsequences of x cannot be too cheap? Would the author add analysis on computation complexity here? 2. In the experiment section, as the main motivation of stacking Seq2Tens layers is to mitigate the limitation of the representation power, how does different number of stacked Seq2Tens layers change the model performance? \n \nClarity: While the paper is highly technical, the author did a good job explaining the idea, concepts and objectives. \n\nOriginality: I am not aware of any other work explore free algebra and its usage on sequential data representation.
