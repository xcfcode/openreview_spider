The paper considers using two variants of losses:  aligned training - same layer wise prediction loss for all tokens, and mixed training: loss on the output of a random layer for each token. For sampling the different layers the paper considers different distributions based on likelihood and the prediction rate.\n\nThe paper experiments these different training strategies on IWLST and WMT datasets. Training with token level sampling based on likelihood results in models that have smaller average exit (number of layers used in prediction) while preserving the BLEU scores of the standard Transformer training. Overall I believe the problem considered is interesting and the paper did a good job in setting up the problem and explaining the experimental setup results.  \n\nThe paper mainly needs to improve in discussing existing work. Universal transformers also study dynamic computation based on input tokens. While the training setup is different here, without the large shared Transformer layers, and this paper mainly focuses on the dynamic halting strategies, it is important to discuss these differences in detail in the paper.\n\nIntroducing a classifier in each layer (W_n) increases the number of parameters and compute by N. How do you handle this? \n\nThe exit loss (eqn 3) is a cross entropy loss, which will have trouble when q^* and q have different supports. Doesn\u2019t a dirac delta q^* cause problems here?\n\n\nMinor:\n\nIntro: first line of second paragraph needs to be rewritten.\n\nThere is a conflict in writing in both abstract and introduction as some sentences say that current models use the same computation irrespective of hardness of the input, followed by discussion of Universal Transformers, which do adaptive computation based on input hardness. The writing flow needs to be fixed in both abstract and intro.\n\n** Post response update **\n\nAfter reading other reviews I think my initial rating 8 might have been a bit higher and am adjusting to 6.

Before that, I'm keeping the current score, while noting that a more accurate rating should be \"5 - Marginally below the acceptance threshold\" (which is not available in ICLR this year). I want to thank the authors for addressing the other issues/questions I raised.\n\n----------------------------------------- Original Review Below -----------------------------------------\n\nSummary: The author proposes a new way to improve the supervision of training encoder-decoder Transformers so that it can make flexible, depth-adaptive predictions at inference time. The paper compares multiple dynamic computation schemes to investigate the effectiveness of these different approaches (e.g., at both sequence and token levels). Relatively extensive experiments were conducted in different settings (on a small and a large MT dataset).\n\nWhile the dynamic halting on Transformers has been previously explored in the Universal Transformers paper, this technique has not been applied to standard (encoder-)decoder Transformers. I think this is an interesting and exciting topic to pursue, as the authors seem to demonstrate (at least on the small IWSLT'14 DE-EN dataset) that we may not need as many layers at the decoding phase as we thought (and thus # of FLOPs).  \n\nHowever, I think the paper can be further improved in terms of both its organization/clarity and its experimental study (see details following).\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nQuestions/comments:\n\n1. Please add a Related Work section. While using dynamic halting on standard Transformers may be novel, general dynamic routing on deep networks (which also aims to reduce the computation) is not. For example, SkipNet [1] uses an input-based dynamic skipping to bypass certain layers of a DNN. It's a good scholarship to give proper credit to prior related work(s).\n\n2. I think Poisson binomial (PB) may be a misnomer for the second qt modeling technique. PB is a probability distribution on the __sum__ of N (unequal) Bernoulli trials [2], which doesn't make sense here. What you are looking for, I think, is a learned \"coin flip\" at every layer of the network to decide whether to continue to the next layer (i.e., you are looking for the first \"head\" in the coin flips, instead of the sum of heads). And indeed, in Eq. (9), the definition for qt(n|...) is a \"geometric-alike\" distribution with success probability \\chi_{t,n} at the n^th flip. (Which brings to a side point: for the \"otherwise\" case in Eq. (9), I think you mean \\prod_n (1-\\chi_{t, n}); otherwise you can't guarantee \\sum_n qt(n|...) = 1 :-) )\n\n3. Why and how did you pick the exit threshold \\chi_{t, n} > 0.5 for your experiments? According to your definition of \\chi_{t,n} and q_t in Eq. (9), isn't the correct thing to do to sample from \\chi_{t, n}? My major concern is that, given different \\sigma (which you didn't specify, but I guess is something like a sigmoid), your \\chi_{t, n} may land in very different ranges. What if you have the following case: \\chi_{t, 1} = 0.501, \\chi_{t, 2} = 0.1, \\chi_{t,3} = 0.999, \\chi_{t,4} = 0.95? Doesn't this mean it may worth it to stop at the 3rd layer instead? (Using the coin flip analogy, having a coin with head probability 0.501 doesn't necessarily mean you \"must\" get a \"head\" at the first flip.) Moreover, if I use $\\sigma = sigmoid(x)/2 + 0.5$, won't I always get a \\chi > 0.5?\n\n4. In the token-specific likelihood-based method, you used an RBF kernel to model the influence of a time step t on its neighboring time steps. Two questions: 1) When you do \\sum_{t'}, did you also include t'<t? 2) Have you tried any other kernels, and how does this choice affect the performance?\n\n5. The aligned training is actually a type of intermediate auxiliary loss (or deep supervision, as the computer vision community probably more often calls it), which makes it not surprising that the unaligned Transformer could perform slightly better than the baseline. I find it interesting that the mixed training strategy doesn't work.\n\n6. Why did you use different training schemes for WMT'14 and IWSLT'14 (e.g., freezing the parameters, etc.)?\n\n7. One of the major concerns I have is that the empirical results don't seem that impressive. First, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive depth estimation methodology, besides comparing to the baseline (black line) in Figures 3 & 4, you should also compare with the blue line (which adds these auxiliary losses to the baseline, but doesn't use the adaptive strategy that involves qt(n|...) at all) for fairness. From Figures 3 & 4, it seems that the adaptive-depth predictions are usually in the close neighborhood of the blue lines when at the same value of AE (instead of substantial, consistent improvement). In addition, while Tok-LL Poisson did well in Figure 4(b), it didn't seem to make a difference in Figure 4(a), which is where one is supposed to tune the hyperparameters on (such as \\lambda, \\sigma; see #8 below). This makes me a bit dubious about how much help the adaptive module brought, compared to just using the aligned model.\n\n8. For the WMT'14 experiments (Figure 4), why is there only one run of the \"Tok-LL Poisson\"? My understanding is that, if you are to use the proposed approach on a new dataset, you would want to try different settings of (\\sigma, \\lambda) on the validation set and pick the best one to use for testing. In Figure 4(a), for instance, for Seq-LL I would probably pick the (\\sigma, \\lambda) setting corresponding to the top-right yellow square--- which turns out to be slightly worse than the blue line on the test set (Figure 4(b)). It'd be useful to plot more \"red triangles\" in Figure 4 to evaluate how much the adaptive-depth methodology contributes to the performance.\n\n========================\n\nSome minor errors that don't have much impact on the score:\n\n9. The beginning sentence of the 4th paragraph of Section 1 is a bit strange (grammatically).\n\n10. Not all equations are numbered! See section 2.\n\n11. In the first equation of Section 2, do you mean h_{\\leq t}^{n-1} rather than h_{< t}^{n-1}? I think h_t from the previous layer is also used?\n\n12. In the 3rd equation of Eq. (12), you should have m somewhere within the summation.\n\n13. Equation (7) missing a right parenthesis.\n\n14. In Eq. (8) W_h is a matrix, whereas in Eq. (9) W_h is a vector (if I'm not mistaken)? Maybe use a lowercase w.\n\n15. Inconsistent notations. For instance, as I described in #3 above, you didn't say in the paper what \\sigma means in Eq. (9), but later re-used the same letter for a different meaning in Eq. (11) for the RBF kernel. Another example is the usage of \\theta_n in the \"Confidence thresholding\" paragraph for the threshold value; you used the same letter again in the \"Gradient scaling\" section of the appendix but with a different meaning (learnable parameters). \n\n16. In the last sentence of the Likelihood-based token specific depth, I'd suggest \\sigma \\rightarrow 0 instead of \\sigma=0, which would otherwise make \\frac{...}{\\sigma} in Eq. (11) undefined.\n\n17. I don't think you specified the \\theta_n used in your experiments (and how you tune them).\n\n18. What is the FS in Appendix B? Also, for \"ffn\" in Table 4, it's best to write its full name before referring to it with acronyms.\n\n19. Just curious: how did you implement the gradient scaling described in Appendix A (e.g., ensuring the \\gamma_n only applies to block n, but not blocks < n)?\n\n========================\n\nI think the current shape of the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold. (Note that while the rating is \"3 - Weak reject\", I don't mean the score, but only the \"weak reject\" part. I'm still excited about the idea of applying dynamic computation in Transformer.) But I'm happy to consider adjusting the score if my concerns above can be satisfactorily addressed.\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09485\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_binomial_distribution", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper73/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper73/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Depth-Adaptive Transformer", "authors": ["Maha Elbayad", "Jiatao Gu", "Edouard Grave", "Michael Auli"], "authorids": ["maha.elbayad@inria.fr", "thomagram@gmail.com", "egrave@fb.com", "michael.auli@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "natural language processing", "sequence modeling"], "TL;DR": "Sequence model that dynamically adjusts the amount of computation for each input.", "abstract": "State of the art sequence-to-sequence models for large scale tasks perform a fixed number of computations for each input sequence regardless of whether it is easy or hard to process.

I think empirical studies in more settings on the large-scale benchmark would be important for future versions of this paper.

If you imagine a 100-layer network with 99 auxiliary losses injected to its intermediate layers, then intuitively these auxiliary losses are (likely) encouraging the outputs of each layer to be similar (to the 100^th layer).

I'm glad to see that some of my questions are resolved (e.g., the PB issue and the kernel issue). And I appreciate the efforts the authors put in updating the paper to fix the various typos and ambiguities.\n\nI am still disappointed that the authors are unable to fully address my concerns in the part of the experiment.\n\n1) Regarding #7, the blue line is indeed \"partly your approach\". But as I said, the blue line is also simply doing deep supervision, whose comparison to the baseline does not come at a surprise to me (even if you may take different exits, as you indicated, you still have __already explicitly optimized__ for it using the auxiliary loss at training time). Moreover, I feel the claim that \"Fig 3(a) & (b) show improvements of 0.5 BLEU for AE 1-1.5\" is still not strong enough to prove its usefulness, because i) for \"aligned\" networks, you can only pick, discretely, either layer # = 1 or 2. There is no middle ground (e.g., doesn't make sense to say what \"1.5 layer\" means in this setting). The blue line segment connecting AE=1 and AE=2 is largely a part of the line chart (for the purpose to connect dots). ii) 2 layers are not deep. Once you want to balance performance with a \"reasonably\" early exit, I think AE=2 is not too bad at all. However, the red triangles are indeed around the blue line when AE=2, in all of the figures.\n\n2) Regarding the \"not enough time\" to further study Figure 4. Is the reported \"Tok-LL Poisson\" setting (and the $\\lambda, \\sigma$ setting) the only one you have ever tried while investigating the approach? (I thought you also froze the encoder-decoder parameters from the first phase to make training more efficient, wouldn't that enable you to explore more settings, too?) Did you manage to start running anything since the response period begins which may be reportable at this stage? If so, it'd be super helpful if you can update your draft with the latest results.

Please find our response to your questions below.\n\n>> The paper mainly needs to improve in discussing existing work. Universal transformers also study dynamic computation based on input tokens.\n\nThere are a number of differences to universal transformer (UT): UT repeatedly applies the same layer for a number of steps, while as our approach applies different layers at every step. The dynamic computation in UT considers a single type of mechanism to estimate the number of steps (=network depth) while as we consider a number of mechanisms and supervision regimes. Moreover, dynamic computation was not actually used for the machine translation experiments in the UT paper (it was used for other tasks though), the authors used a fixed number of steps for every input instead.\n\nWe emphasized these differences in our updated paper.\n\n\n>> Introducing a classifier in each layer (W_n) increases the number of parameters and compute by N. How do you handle this? \n\nThe number of parameters are only increased if we do not share the weights of output classifiers between each layer. We found a slight benefit when sharing output classifier weights for WMT En-Fr but not on IWSLT De-En. \nAt inference time, only a single classifier is ever used (except for confidence thresholding), which does not change compute (in fact, we lower it when we use fewer layers).\nDuring training, compute requirements only increase very slightly when training N classifiers. On WMT En-Fr training time increased only by about 1%, keeping everything else equal. We added this to the updated paper.\n\n>> The exit loss (eqn 3) is a cross entropy loss, which will have trouble when $q^*$ and q have different supports. Doesn\u2019t a dirac delta $q^*$ cause problems here?\n\nThis is a good point. Since the distributions are discrete, the right delta is the Kronecker delta with 1 on the exit chosen by the oracle and 0 otherwise. The support of q and $q^*$ is within {1,..,N}\nso $H(q^*, q) = - \\sum_{n=1}^N q^*(n) \\log q(n)$\n\n\n\n>> \u2026 some sentences say that current models use the same computation irrespective of hardness of the input, followed by discussion of Universal Transformers, which do adaptive computation based on input hardness. \n\nWe will make this more clear. With current models, we refer to state-of-the-art architectures in NMT. Universal transformers do not report results on machine translation with dynamic computation, instead, they use a fixed number of steps regardless of the input - this is not dynamic computation. We clarified this in the updated version of the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper73/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper73/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Depth-Adaptive Transformer", "authors": ["Maha Elbayad", "Jiatao Gu", "Edouard Grave", "Michael Auli"], "authorids": ["maha.elbayad@inria.fr", "thomagram@gmail.com", "egrave@fb.com", "michael.auli@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "natural language processing", "sequence modeling"], "TL;DR": "Sequence model that dynamically adjusts the amount of computation for each input.", "abstract": "State of the art sequence-to-sequence models for large scale tasks perform a fixed number of computations for each input sequence regardless of whether it is easy or hard to process.

I think Poisson binomial may be a misnomer\n\nThis is a good point! We corrected eq (9), it is indeed $\\prod_{n\u2019=1}^N  (1-{\\chi_t}^{n\u2019})$ for n=N.\nIt is similar to a geometric distribution but with different success rates chi_t^n.\nWe changed the name of the distribution to avoid any misunderstanding.\n\n\n>> 3. Why and how did you pick the exit threshold $\\chi_{t, n} > 0.5$? \n\nSigma is the sigmoid function. We choose threshold 0.5 to simply select the likely outcome  (continue or stop), i.e., we choose to follow the argmax of the distribution. We did experiment with tuning the threshold(s) similar to confidence thresholding which yielded slightly better results but the 0.5 threshold was a good compromise between simplicity and performance. Sampling a decision is an interesting avenue for future work. We focused on different ways to modeling the distribution itself.\n \n\n>> 4. RBF kernel: When you do $\\sum_{t'}$, did you also include t'<t? Have you tried any other kernels, and how does this choice affect the performance?\n\nYes, we also include t\u2019<t in the summation. \nWe did not try other kernels. The motivation for the RBF kernel is to smooth the scores of each step by including signals from neighbouring tokens. As for the effect of sigma on the performance, we show an ablation study of these parameters in Appendix C of the updated paper.\n\n\n>> 5. The aligned training is a type of intermediate auxiliary loss (or deep supervision, as the CV community probably more often calls it), which makes it not surprising that the unaligned Transformer could perform slightly better than the baseline. I find it interesting that the mixed training strategy doesn't work.\n\nYes, aligned training is similar to deep supervision in CV. However, it is somewhat surprising that it also worked when we used different exits within the same sequence at inference. This exposes the self-attention to copied states - something that did not happen during training.\n\nMixed training does work, it performs as well as training N different models of varying depth, cf. Table 1 \u201cbaseline\u201d vs. \u201cMixed M=6\u201d (most comparable setup to baseline). However, the aligned training does perform slightly better than both. The mixed training is also more costly to training since M different forward/backwards are required per sample.\n\n\n>> 6. Why did you use different training schemes for WMT'14 and IWSLT'14 (e.g., freezing the parameters, etc.)?\n\nWe follow previous work on the number of checkpoints we use to average (WMT En-Fr) or no averaging at all (IWSLT De-En). WMT En-Fr requires ten checkpoints, epochs are long since it is a large dataset, and model performance did deteriorate when the exit classifier was trained for too long. Therefore, we opted to freeze the encoder-decoder classifier parameters for this dataset only.\n\n\n>> 7. One of the major concerns I have is that the empirical results don't seem that impressive. \n>> ... you should also compare with the blue line\n\nThe aligned model (blue line) is part of our approach, hence the comparison to the baseline. Aligned is a single model while the baseline consists of N=6 different models which is a clear advantage of the aligned approach that is part of our method.\n\n>> ... it seems that the adaptive-depth predictions are usually in the close neighborhood of the blue lines when at the same value of AE ...\n\nThis is true for higher AE but there are substantial improvements for low average exits (AE): Fig 3(a) & (b) show improvements of 0.5 BLEU for AE 1-1.5. Therefore, when we really would like to save a lot of computation, adaptive depth can make a meaningful impact. \n\n\n>> In addition, while Tok-LL Poisson did well in Figure 4(b), it didn't seem to make a difference in Figure 4(a), which is where one is supposed to tune the hyper-parameters on (such as $\\lambda$, $\\sigma$; see #8 below). \n\nThe results in Fig 4 are not well tuned because we simply ran out of time until the deadline; see the response for #8 below.\n\n\n>> 8. For the WMT'14 experiments (Fig 4), why is there only one run of the \"Tok-LL Poisson\"?\n\nTo meet the submission deadline, we only had time to train a single model and optimize a single $(\\sigma, \\lambda)$ configuration for WMT En-Fr. \n\n\nMinor comments: \n\nThank you for the thorough feedback, we fixed the mistakes you pointed out in the updated version.\n\n>> 17.

Training speed is actually slightly decreased compared to a standard Transformer because we need to compute N output classifiers instead of just a single output classifier, however, since training benefits heavily from batching, the overhead of this is very minimal. On the WMT En-Fr benchmark we only see a marginal slowdown of 1% when training multiple output classifiers compared to just one for the baseline.

On IWSLT German-English translation our approach matches the accuracy of a well tuned baseline Transformer while using less than a quarter of the decoder layers.", "pdf": "/pdf/6083b51a6c735b02350d9490ad0a5f3340cd90cf.pdf", "paperhash": "elbayad|depthadaptive_transformer", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nElbayad2020Depth-Adaptive,\ntitle={Depth-Adaptive Transformer},\nauthor={Maha Elbayad and Jiatao Gu and Edouard Grave and Michael Auli},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJg7KhVKPH}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/8846eea47720c1ae6383f1ab8c93e245ea6d862d.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
