This is accomplished by combining ideas from HDP with the NCRP process, where the entire nCRP tree is replicated for each document where a sample from each DP at each node of the original tree is used as a shared base distribution for each document's own DP.\r\n\r\nThe idea is novel and is an important contribution in the area of unsupervised large scale text modeling.\r\n\r\nAlthough the paper is strong on novelty, it seems to be incomplete in terms of presenting any evidence that the model actually works and is better than the original NCRP model. Does it learn better topics than nCRP? Is the new model a better predictor of text? Does it produce a better hierararchy of topics than the original model? Does the better representation of documents translate into better performance on any extrinsic task? Without any preliminary answers to these questions, in my mind, the work is incomplete at best."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Nested HDP for Hierarchical Topic Models", "decision": "conferenceOral-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "We develop a nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling.

In this work, a document specific tree is drawn (with associated switching probabilities) which is then used to generate words in the document. Consequently, the words can represent very different topics not necessarily associated with the same path in the tree. \r\n\r\nThough the work is clearly interesting and important for the topic modeling community, the workshop paper could potentially be improved.  The main problem is clearly the length of the submission which does not provide any kind of details (less than 2 pages of content). Though additional information can be found in the cited arxiv paper, I think it would make sense to include in the workshop paper at least the comparison in terms of perplexity (showing that it substantially outperforms nCRP) and maybe some details on efficiency of inference. \r\nConversely, the page-long Figure 2 could be reduced or removed to fit the content.\r\n\r\nOverall, the work is quite interesting and seems to be a perfect fit for the conference. Given that an extended version is publicly available, I do not think that the above comments are really important.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-- a natural extension of the previous model which achieves respectable results on standard benchmarks (though results are not included in the submissions)\r\nCons:\r\n-- a little more information about the model and its performance could be included even in a 3-page workshop paper."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Nested HDP for Hierarchical Topic Models", "decision": "conferenceOral-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "We develop a nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling.
