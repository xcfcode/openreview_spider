For example in table 2 or table 3, many of confidence intervals overlap. Furthermore, these results are shown in the best setting of the model -- when nearby tasks are drawn almost directly from the same training distribution. Furthermore\n\nThe overall technical novelty of approach seems to be low. Modularity with meta learning has been explored before, and the physical learning framework has also been learned before. This work seeks to combine both but does not seem have to have impressive performance. \n\nGiven that a central claim in the paper is that \"We extract shareable parameters in the spatial\nmodules from synthetic data, which can be generated from different dynamics easily.\" I think it would be good to empirically test this result and  synthetic data is generated more diversely. For example, in Table 1/2, what happens when the underlying uis have different functional forms? What if only the test task has a separate functional form?\n\nThere are only three evaluated datasets in the entire paper -- one being a toy problem to visualize the impact of the approach. Since PDEs occur in so many different disciplines, it would be good to evaluate on additional datasets to more throughly validate the utility of this approach. For example, it may also be interesting to test this on additional non graph based settings.\n\n### Post Rebuttal Update\n\nI thank the authors for their response. However, I still have some remaining concerns about novelty, since to me this paper reads as another application of MAML to domain X, to speed up performance in the particular domain. Furthermore, I think it would be good to evaluate generalization to larger extent, for example on different conformations of dynamics as opposed to a fixed set of parameters on the synthetic dataset.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning", "authorids": ["~Sungyong_Seo1", "~Chuizheng_Meng1", "~Sirisha_Rambhatla1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Sungyong Seo", "Chuizheng Meng", "Sirisha Rambhatla", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["physics-aware learning", "spatiotemporal graph signals", "few shot learning"], "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited.

The pre-training has been performed on the synthetic data, and the authors mention the limitations of the approach: *\u201c\nAlthough introducing auxiliary tasks based on synthetic datasets improves the prediction performance, they need to be chosen and constructed manually and intuitively.\u201d* In connection to that, there might be less scarce, non-extreme, events in the same dataset, which could be used for pretraining. For example, in the extreme weather dataset,  the top-10 extreme weather events since 1984 are selected; is it possible to use some of the remaining data for pretraining on non-extreme events? This could remove the bias of synthetic dataset hyper parameter tuning and could serve as  a baseline. Is it possible to say how would the method, pre-trained on such real non-extreme dataset, perform against the synthetic baseline in this case?\n\n3. In Table 3, the experimental results are reported, with an (anticipated) tendency of diminishing return in spatial meta-initialisation as the number of T-shots increase; is there any way to see whether, as the value of T is increased, there will be the value T when pre-training does not improve or even has worse performance?

Basically, the learnable spatial modules in the proposed method are replaced by finite modules, which numerically compute the spatial derivatives (gradients and Laplacian). Since we have graph signals as our main datasets, we defined the gradients as edge features $\\nabla u_{ij}=\\frac{u_j - u_i}{||x_j - x_i||}$ where $u_i$ is a graph signal at node $i$ and $x_i$ is a positional vector of the node $i$, and Laplacian as node features $\\nabla^2 u_i=\\sum_{j\\in N_i}\\nabla u_{ij}$.  \n\nT-shot   | Method | AQI-CO | ExtremeWeather |\n:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|\n5-shot | FDM+RGN | 0.0291$\\pm$0.0039 | 0.9883$\\pm$0.5567 |\n | PA-DGN | 0.0363$\\pm$0.0090 | 0.9653$\\pm$0.1384 |\n | PiMetaL | **0.0253$\\pm$0.0055** | **0.9167$\\pm$0.0746** |\n7-shot | FDM+RGN | 0.0258$\\pm$0.0023 | 0.7626$\\pm$0.0602 |\n | PA-DGN | 0.0225$\\pm$0.0018 | 0.7478$\\pm$0.0199 |\n | PiMetaL | **0.0182$\\pm$0.0019** | **0.7274$\\pm$0.0089** |\n10-shot | FDM+RGN | 0.0213$\\pm$0.0013 | 0.7090$\\pm$0.0030 |\n | PA-DGN | 0.0146$\\pm$0.0005 | 0.4156$\\pm$0.0145 | \n | PiMetaL | **0.0115$\\pm$0.0004** | **0.4066$\\pm$0.0247** |\n\n> The finite difference method provides proxies of exact spatial derivatives and the representations are useful particularly when $T=5$ but its performance is rapidly saturated and it comes from the gap between the learnable spatial modules and fixed numerical coefficients. The results provide a new point of view on how to utilize synthetic or simulated datasets to handle challenges caused by limited datasets.\n\n\n### Pre-training with same dataset\n\n> While it is an interesting idea to utilize non-extreme events in the same dataset for pre-training, this approach is not associated with our proposed method. First of all, we define **the auxiliary task as supervised learning for spatial derivatives**, and for the auxiliary task labels, **the exact spatial derivatives are only available in the simulated dynamics** since the simulated one is generated from an analytic equation. In the real-world dataset, especially graph signals which have a spatially low resolution, the exact spatial derivatives are not available and it is hard to be estimated due to the significant numerical error. \nIn this work, we claim that **the spatial derivatives are PDE-independent/-invariant representations and they can be meta-learned from synthetic data** describing locally conserved quantities. \n\n### The value T when pre-training does not improve or even has worse performance\n\n> For task 1 (multi-step graph signal generation), our datasets are extremely short across different tasks. Mostly, the length of each task is shorter than 20-steps, and thus, it is not possible to increase $T$ as much as we want. However, in the additional experiment (task 2, graph signal regression), we found that the performance is no more significantly improved when we increase the number of samples from 5 to 10 (See 5-shot (EU) and 10-shot (EU) in the general response above.). While the regression errors seem to be converged, our model provides a much lower error level than those of other baselines."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning", "authorids": ["~Sungyong_Seo1", "~Chuizheng_Meng1", "~Sirisha_Rambhatla1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Sungyong Seo", "Chuizheng Meng", "Sirisha Rambhatla", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["physics-aware learning", "spatiotemporal graph signals", "few shot learning"], "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited.

If targeted dynamics are defined in 3D dimension space such as temperature across longitude/latitude/altitude, the simulated dynamics are supposed to be 3D as well. Since many variants of the continuity equation can be seamlessly defined in 3D or higher dimension (e.g., Navier-Stokes equation in 3D) and the exact spatial derivatives can be defined in all directions, we can easily extend our model to the 3D space by adding additional spatial modules for spatial derivatives along the z-axis.

The overall technical novelty seems to be low\n\n> While it is common that we only have access to a limited amount of data in physical systems in the real world, there have been few attempts to address this problem. Meta-learning has been introduced to handle few-shot learning efficiently, however, there are challenges for the existing meta-learning methods for modeling natural phenomena because it is not clearly known **(1) which representations need to be extracted** and **(2) how to extract the representations for different spatiotemporal observations in the real world**.\nThus, it is very hard to define a shareable feature extractor for the physics-associated dynamics and prepare a large amount of data to pretrain the extractor to learn generalizable representations that are easily adaptable to unseen few-shot samples.\n\n> This work is one of **the first to explore effective representations shareable/generalizable across different physics-associated dynamics without knowing exact forms of PDEs** and **how the PDE-independent/-invariant representations can be extracted from simulated datasets to tackle limited data challenge** in real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, there are very limited works about how to leverage simulated dynamics for efficient learning of data-driven models with few physics-guided observations and we think that this work provides a research direction for physics-guided/-informed deep learning.\n\n> To support the proposed method more thoroughly, we conducted **additional experiments** and provided the results in the updated manuscript (**Section 5.3**) as well as **the general response to all reviewers above**. From the results, we can see that the proposed method achieved significant improvement in reducing regression error by utilizing simulated dynamics to meta-train spatial modules, which are designed to learn PDE-independent/-invariant representations.\n\n### Regarding different dynamics for synthetic dataset\n\n> It is important to generate diverse synthetic data to meta-train the spatial modules. For each configuration (N,E,F), we have generated 100 different sequences and each sequence has different initial values, which are randomly generated. (See Fig. 2 in the draft) In other words, the generated sequences are fairly different even if they have the same configuration due to the random initial values and thus, the experimental results (Table 2) cover the diverse enough simulated dynamics. \n\n### What if only the test task has a separate functional form?\n\n> This question is directly addressed on the experimental results on the real-world dynamics since we don't have a closed-form PDE for the dynamics explicitly. In other words, while the test task's functional form is unknown, we successfully show that the meta-initialized spatial modules by simulated PDEs are effectively adapted to the different functional forms. We also added additional experimental results to validate the proposed idea more thoroughly. Please check **the general response (Suggestion 1 and 3) and the updated manuscript (Section 5.3 and Appendix C) for more details**.\n\n### Limited datasets\n\n> Thanks for the suggestion. We have conducted an additional experiment (Graph signal regression) described in DeepSphere (Defferrard et al.) to thoroughly validate the proposed idea and to analyze how different auxiliary tasks influence the performance. Please check **the general response (Suggestion 1) and the updated manuscript (Section 5.3)** for more details."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning", "authorids": ["~Sungyong_Seo1", "~Chuizheng_Meng1", "~Sirisha_Rambhatla1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Sungyong Seo", "Chuizheng Meng", "Sirisha Rambhatla", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["physics-aware learning", "spatiotemporal graph signals", "few shot learning"], "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited.

Specifically, we split the GHCN data spatially into two regions: (1) the USA (1,705 stations) and (2) Europe (EU) (703 stations).\n\n**Task**\n> We consider a regression task where we predict the temperature $x_t$ from the temperature on the previous 5 days ($x_{t-5}:x_{t-1}$).\n\n**Results** \nThese results are presented in Table 4 in the updated manuscript.\n\nT-shot (region)&nbsp;&nbsp;    | GCN | GAT | GraphSAGE | GN | PA-DGN | PiMetaL\n:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n5-shot (USA) | 2.742$\\pm$0.120&nbsp;&nbsp; | 2.549$\\pm$0.115&nbsp;&nbsp; | 2.128$\\pm$0.146&nbsp;&nbsp; | 2.252$\\pm$0.131&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.950$\\pm$0.152&nbsp;&nbsp; | **1.794**$\\pm$**0.130**\n10-shot (USA) | 2.371$\\pm$0.095&nbsp;&nbsp; | 2.178$\\pm$0.066&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.848$\\pm$0.206&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.949$\\pm$0.115&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.687$\\pm$0.104&nbsp;&nbsp; | **1.567**$\\pm$**0.103**\n5-shot (EU) | 1.218$\\pm$0.218&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.161$\\pm$0.234&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.165$\\pm$0.248&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.181$\\pm$0.210&nbsp;&nbsp; | 0.914$\\pm$0.167&nbsp;&nbsp; | **0.781**$\\pm$**0.019**\n10-shot (EU) | 1.186$\\pm$0.076&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.142$\\pm$0.070&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.044$\\pm$0.210&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1.116$\\pm$0.147&nbsp;&nbsp; | 0.831$\\pm$0.058&nbsp;&nbsp; | **0.773**$\\pm$**0.014**\n\n> The table above shows the results of the graph signal regression task across different baselines and the proposed method. There are two patterns in the results. First, although in general we observe an improvement in performance for all methods when we move from the 5-shot setting to the 10-shot setting, PiMetaL\u2019s performance yields the smallest error. For the EU dataset, while 5-shot seems enough to achieve stable performance, it demonstrates that the PDE-independent representations make the regression error converge to a lower level. Overall, the experimental results prove that the learned spatial representations from simulated dynamics are beneficial for learning on limited data.\nWe have updated the main draft to include the additional experimental results **(See Section 5.3)** for further details.\n\n\n### Suggestion 2: How to choose and construct auxiliary tasks (or synthetic datasets)?\n\n> Indeed the choice of the synthetic data does depend on the specific application. Throughout the paper, we used the convection-diffusion equations to generate (spatially continuous) simulated dynamics (Long et al. PDE-Net) and sampled a finite number of nodes to construct graph signals.\nWhen we generate simulated dynamics, sample the nodes, and construct graph structure, there are 3 parameters we can tune.\nN: The number of sampled nodes\nE: The number of adjacent nodes in a graph structure\nF: The spatial frequency (it determines the function\u2019s fluctuation and scale)\nFor **the task 1 (Section 5.2 Multi-step graph signal generation)**, we generated 100 different sequences (sequence length 20) per one combination of (N,E,F) where N$\\in${256,625}, E$\\in${4,8}, and F$\\in${2,5}. These parameters were selected to cover the topological properties of the target datasets. For AQI and ExtremeWeather datasets, the number of sensors (nodes) is varying from 40 to 200, the number of adjacent nodes is 4 and 6, respectively. First, we intended to generate finer resolution (more nodes) synthetic dynamics than that of the target dataset to train SDM with the finer resolution data and apply it to coarse resolution data. Second, we set E and F to encompass the topological properties of the target data.\n\n> For **the additional task 2 (Section 5.3 Graph signal regression)**, we generated synthetic dynamics for meta-train tasks and the synthetic data is adapted to a target dataset. Before setting the topological configuration for the synthetic dynamics, we first looked into the target dataset to understand its topological properties. Based on the number of stations and the scale of records, we tuned the topological configuration for the synthetic dataset. We used (N,F)=(1700,2) for the USA records (1705 nodes) and (N,F)=(700,1.5) for Europe records (703 nodes), respectively, and 100 different initial values were generated to define different tasks."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning", "authorids": ["~Sungyong_Seo1", "~Chuizheng_Meng1", "~Sirisha_Rambhatla1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Sungyong Seo", "Chuizheng Meng", "Sirisha Rambhatla", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["physics-aware learning", "spatiotemporal graph signals", "few shot learning"], "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited.

One reason is that it is unknown what are the shareable/generalizable representations across different tasks for the physics-associated dynamics unlike for images. \nIn this work, we first show that **spatial derivatives are associated with the shareable and invariant representations** across different physical dynamics inspired by a form of the continuity equation. Then, we propose **PDE-independent/-invariant spatial modules**, which are designed to learn the spatial representations via an auxiliary task, *supervised learning of spatial derivatives*. The spatial modules leverage simulated dynamics which can provide the invariant/shareable information across different dynamics. As the simulated dynamics can be easily generated, we can utilize large amounts of synthetic datasets for meta-training the spatial modules via auxiliary tasks, which are supervised learning for the spatial derivatives. Finally, we demonstrate **the effectiveness of the meta-trained spatial modules** on the graph signal prediction tasks of real-world dynamics with few observations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide PDE-independent/-invariant representations that are reusable across different physics-related dynamics and use the physics-inspired inductive bias under the meta-learning settings to tackle the limited data issue which is pretty common for real-world data.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2883/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Physics-aware Spatiotemporal Modules with Auxiliary Tasks for Meta-Learning", "authorids": ["~Sungyong_Seo1", "~Chuizheng_Meng1", "~Sirisha_Rambhatla1", "~Yan_Liu1"], "authors": ["Sungyong Seo", "Chuizheng Meng", "Sirisha Rambhatla", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["physics-aware learning", "spatiotemporal graph signals", "few shot learning"], "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited.

Toward that end, the initial differencing coefficients appear to be chosen using a flat 2D topology. The appropriateness of this choice is probably responsible for the improvements offered by the proposed approach. However, if the initial topology is poorly chosen, or the different tasks have significantly different topologies one would expect poor performance or negative transfer.

The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of real-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in simulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules.

The scarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data distribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the knowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of the data can be helpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to exactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems.
