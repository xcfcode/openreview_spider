I wish there are more papers which study how to debug a model which requires lots of computational resources. \n\nThis paper focuses on difficulties involved in models which uses  large datasets for training. This paper makes the claim that in order to understand better what the model is doing, it's important to have monitoring systems in the discovery process.\nThis paper does a pretty good job in describing the components involved in a system like \nAlphaGo (and its variants). Specifically, paper focuses on reproducibility in self-play algorithms.\nIts interesting to know that conclusion of the paper is  to monitor nearly everything one could think of, to make sure that the implementation is bug-free.\n", "rating": "5: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML/Paper6/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Minigo: A Case Study in Reproducing Reinforcement Learning Research", "authors": ["Anonymous"], "authorids": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML/Paper6/Authors"], "keywords": [], "TL;DR": "We reproduced AlphaZero on Google Cloud Platform", "abstract": "The reproducibility of reinforcement-learning research has been highlighted as a key challenge area in the field.
