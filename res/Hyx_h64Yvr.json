Several experimental results are reported but, in my opinion, they are not convincing enough. \nBelow, a list of issues is presented:\n-\tI think the term \u201cKronecker\u201d in the name of the model is not well justified or explained. I don\u2019t see a Kronecker product of matrices in the attention operator. Maybe, only in the case of KAO_{QKV} the outer sum could be written as a Kronecker product of some matrices justifying the name. I think this is not a big issue but it is a little bit annoying to use a term that is not naturally introduced to the reader.\n-\tIn my opinion, the main issue is that taking the mean over columns and rows as the only information to construct the attention operator seems not able to capture all relevant information about the underlying dataset. I think there is not a theory that justifies this approach. For example, it could be possible that other linear or nonlinear combination of rows and columns provides better attention operators. \n-\tIt is not clear how the theoretical results (Theorem 1) helps to support the proposed method. Maybe the authors could better explain the implications of their theoretical results. I found the introduction of the method clear but rather disconnected from the theoretical sections 3.3-3.5.\n-\tExperimental results are not convincing. I cannot agree with the author\u2019s claim that \u201cKANets significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art compact models\u201d. Below I make comments to each of the presented experimental results.\no\tThe experimental results about memory and time used by regular attention operator compared with KAOs is obvious and not relevant because their theoretical complexities are well known.\no\tIn Table 2, it is shown that the proposed method is better than other non-attentional networks. I think this result is not relevant. On the other side, in Table 3, they compare the proposed method against two other attentional networks and show that the proposed method is not better than previous methods in terms of performance. The only advantage seems to be a slight reduction in number of operations which is marginal. \no\tIn the Ablation Studies (Table 4), the method is not compared with other classical attention network. They only compared against MobileNet. I wonder how the performance results would be if classical attention networks were used having the same level of number of parameters.\no\tThe results on Image Segmentation are not relevant because the proposed method is not the best one.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper786/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper786/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Kronecker Attention Networks", "authors": ["Hongyang Gao", "Zhengyang Wang", "Shuiwang Ji"], "authorids": ["hongyang.gao@tamu.edu", "zhengyang.wang@tamu.edu", "sji@tamu.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Attention operators have been applied on both 1-D data like texts and higher-order data such as images and videos.

Regular self-attention on images produce HW queries attend to HW keys and their values, resulting in quadratic time/space complexity O((HW)^2).\nIn contrast, KAO applies self-attention after averaging keys, values (and potentially queries) along width or height dimension, resulting in (H+W) keys and values and thus achieving linear time/space complexity in O(HW).\nThe authors analyze their approach from a probabilistic perspective by assuming that the rows and columns follow matrix-variate normal distributions with Kronecker covariance.\nExperimental results on ImageNet classification and PASCAL segmentation show that adding Kronecker Attention Operators to baseline architectures yields improvements with a negligible increase in parameters/computations.\n\n\n\n=== Recommendation ===\nAttention has been shown to provide improvements over convolutions but can indeed incur significant memory costs. Hence, discovering efficient attention mechanisms in an important research direction with practical impact. \nThe proposed method is sound and simple and may achieve significant speedups over regular self-attention.\n\nHowever, there are many experimental presentation/evaluation issues in the draft:\n- An important assumption of the method is that Kronecker factorization preserves structure well while reducing computations. Previous works reduce memory costs by pooling the input to the attention operator (and resizing accordingly the output). A natural baseline would be to pool in such a way that the number of queries is the same as when applying Kronecker factorization. Can the authors report results on such a baseline?\n- Section 4.1 and Table 1 present computational efficiency (memory and latency) in simulated cases. Can the authors additionally report results for the gains obtained on the entire architectures? The rest of the architecture isn't an external factor to ignore.\n- Can the authors also report memory consumption and latency time of KANet vs MobileNetv2?\n- The authors ignore a vast literature on (self-)attention mechanisms used in vision, some of which are relatively cheap. These methods should also be cited as related work and potentially use as baselines (Squeeze-and-Excitation for example).\n\nThe probabilistic analysis does not convincingly motivate the Kronecker Attention Operator. Notably, the assumptions for Theorem 1 are also quite unrealistic for images (nearby pixels are correlated via locality, so rows and columns aren't independent). Can the authors clarify the assumptions and explain why they're reasonable?\n\nIn conclusion, the authors only compare their approach against regular self-attention and do not refer to relevant work on attention mechanisms for vision. They do not provide memory/consumption gains on actual architectures, which makes it hard to evaluate the significance of the work. The theoretical motivation for the method is not convincing. I argue for rejection. \n\n=== Additional questions/comments ===\n- Section 2.1: Self-attention is better described as Q = W^Q X, K = W^K X, V = W^V X, O = V softmax(K^TQ). As opposed to Q=K=V, O = W^V V softmax((W^KK)^TW^QQ)\n- Since the base architecture KANet is MobileNetv2, there is no need to include VGG, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, in Table 2."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper786/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper786/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Kronecker Attention Networks", "authors": ["Hongyang Gao", "Zhengyang Wang", "Shuiwang Ji"], "authorids": ["hongyang.gao@tamu.edu", "zhengyang.wang@tamu.edu", "sji@tamu.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Attention operators have been applied on both 1-D data like texts and higher-order data such as images and videos.

The proposed operators enforce various constraints on the query key and value matrices of the attention module, where some (or all) of these matrices are obtained as horizontal and lateral averages of the query matrix; in this context, the query matrix is actually the flattening of a 3rd order tensor, whose slices are referred to as \"feature maps\". A theoretical analysis investigates the properties of imposing a Kronecker structured covariance matrix on the feature maps. The main theorem provides a way to efficiently construct feature maps satisfying this covariance structure. Experiments on image classification and segmentation are given where the proposed approach shows competitive performances while maintaining a number of parameters on par with efficient architectures such as neural nets.\n\nI find this paper difficult to follow. In particular, I find it difficult to see the relevance of the theoretical analysis part. I think I got it in the end, but I believe the analysis could be better motivated/presented and the consequences of Theorem 1 on design choices or implementation could be clarified. Similarly, the description of the architecture in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 is sometimes given without much motivation, letting the reader wonder there are particular reasons for the choices made on the architecture. I acknowledge that this may be because I am not very familiar with attention networks (but I am familiar with the literature on tensorization of neural networks).\n\nI am not very confident in my assessment but I have the feeling that the paper could be greatly improved by some restructuring and giving more insights and motivations.\n\nI have a few questions and comments:\n- end of section 2.1: what is the purpose of the seperate linear transformation on each input matrix?\n- after Eq.

Moreover, we analyze KAOs theoretically from a probabilistic perspective and point out that KAOs assume the data follow matrix-variate normal distributions. Experimental results show that KAOs reduce the amount of required computational resources by a factor of hundreds, with larger factors for higher-dimensional and higher-order data. Results also show that networks with KAOs outperform models without attention, while achieving competitive performance as those with original attention operators.", "pdf": "/pdf/ba08404803b33e5ca3ec00c7945c7543264c1a67.pdf", "paperhash": "gao|kronecker_attention_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/ba08404803b33e5ca3ec00c7945c7543264c1a67.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ngao2020kronecker,\ntitle={Kronecker Attention Networks},\nauthor={Hongyang Gao and Zhengyang Wang and Shuiwang Ji},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyx_h64Yvr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
