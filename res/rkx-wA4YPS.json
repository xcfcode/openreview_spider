But they don\u2019t consider other metrics\n  like the error in weight estimates which is considered in most of the prior work \n * They don\u2019t compare their results with regularizations suggested on top of BBSE, particularly Azizzadenesheli et. al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09734. \n * They compare methods for particularly limited ranges of Dirichlet shift (\\alpha=0.1,1.0). \n  * What happens when the \\alpha increases to have less severe shifts? \nOptimizing ELBO with EM can lead to local convergence to the likelihood function when the likelihood is not unimodal. \n *  Is this likelihood function unimodal?  Does the EM approach converges to MLE under some appropriate initialization and assumptions? \n  \nA small presentation note: many of the papers are reporting the same metric and ought to be grouped as a large table, not as many tables. Also every table should state clearly what it is reporting in the caption, not just referring to earlier tables.\n\n=======Update\nI have read the rebuttal and appreciate that the authors took the time to establish the concavity of the likelihood function for EM. Overall this paper makes an interesting contribution in establishing the usefulness of the likelihood formulation (here optimized by EM) of label shift estimation and its apparent benefits over BBSE in some settings. I am happy to keep my score despite apparent disagreement from the other reviewers. I must say that some other reviews were disappointingly lacking in thoroughness.  \n \nThe paper still leaves open some serious questions, e.g. --- why is this bias correction heuristic so effective vis-a-vis EM and is this explained by its performance at the calibration task itself? The original temperature scaling paper reported a similar heuristic yet didn't see such a benefit wrt their metrics. Why is it so useful here? \n\nStill, while this paper can be improved in some key ways, it does make an interesting contribution.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adapting to Label Shift with Bias-Corrected Calibration", "authors": ["Avanti Shrikumar", "Amr M.

We would like to highlight the following points:\n\nWhile generalization bounds are beyond the scope of this paper, our work revisits EM as a viable yet missing method from the recent literature ([1], [2], [3]). The EM algorithm comes with strong theoretical grounding when the probabilities are calibrated [4]. However, at the time when the EM algorithm was introduced for label shift adaptation, research on calibration techniques that are specifically tailored to DNNs had not been conducted.\n\nOur contribution is to unify the two lines of research - calibration techniques and domain adaptation - to show that one can achieve strong performance by using calibration in conjunction with the EM algorithm. A key observation that we made is that the popular calibration approach of Temperature Scaling can be improved upon by the addition of class-specific bias parameters. Vector Scaling, which does extend Temperature Scaling by including class-specific bias parameters, was not recommended in the paper that introduced it because it was observed to produce worse performance on the ECE metric, and thus has not been adopted. Our work demonstrates the importance of retaining these class-specific bias parameters in the context of label shift. Until we had investigated the importance of including bias correction, we ourselves were adopting the Temperature Scaling approach.\n\nWhen we proposed an alternative method for calculating source-domain priors for EM in the presence of poor calibration, we provided the appropriate analytical discussion (lemma 1, section 3.2). In addition, as requested by Reviewer 2, we have revised the manuscript to include a proof (appendix A) showing that maximizing the likelihood is a convex optimization problem - thus, we can expect EM will converge to a global optimum. Empirically, we verified that this technique enables EM to perform very well at shift estimation across different datasets compared to the recently-introduced Black-Box Shift Estimation, even when the probabilities are not well calibrated. More research into why EM is so effective would be the subject of future work.\n\nHaving included Regularized Learning under Label Shift in the comparisons (Azizzadenesheli et al.) in the revised comparisons, we find that our proposed approach of EM combined with bias-corrected calibration now achieves state-of-the-art results in our experiments, outperforming both RLLS and BBSL on a significant majority of comparisons. Note that the RLLS and BBSL papers did not include comparisons to the EM approach - in fact, benchmarks against the EM algorithm have been missing from multiple recent high-profile works [1, 2, 3], seemingly due to a misconception regarding the scalability of the algorithm.\n\nRegarding the distribution shifts, Dirichlet and tweak one shifts are standard in the literature and capture the first order effects of label shifts for several real world applications ([2], [3]). We also revised the manuscript to include comparisons against RLLS ([3]) on all the datasets and included new comparisons on MNIST.\n\nWe believe this work is rigorous and experimentally sound. We hope you reconsider this submission in light of the above comments.\n\n\n[1] Zhang, Kun, Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, Krikamol Muandet, and Zhikun Wang. \"Domain adaptation under target and conditional shift.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 819-827. 2013.\n\n[2] Lipton, Zachary C., Yu-Xiang Wang, and Alex Smola. \"Detecting and correcting for label shift with black box predictors.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03916 (2018).\n\n[3] Azizzadenesheli, Kamyar, Anqi Liu, Fanny Yang, and Animashree Anandkumar. \"Regularized learning for domain adaptation under label shifts.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.09734 (2019).\n\n[4] Saerens, Marco, Patrice Latinne, and Christine Decaestecker. \"Adjusting the outputs of a classifier to new a priori probabilities: a simple procedure.\" Neural computation 14, no. 1 (2002): 21-41.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adapting to Label Shift with Bias-Corrected Calibration", "authors": ["Avanti Shrikumar", "Amr M.

Note that the RLLS and BBSL papers did not include comparisons to the EM approach - in fact, benchmarks against the EM algorithm have been missing from multiple recent high-profile works [1, 2, 3], seemingly due to a misconception regarding the scalability of the algorithm.\n\nThe specific calibration approach that we recommend in order to achieve state-of-the-art results is an approach that is not the dominant approach recommended in the literature. In particular, we find that it is important to use a calibration approach that contains class-specific bias parameters that are capable of correcting for systematic bias in the calibrated probabilities. Although one such approach - Vector Scaling - was introduced in Guo et al., it was not the method that the authors ultimately recommended for calibration because it achieved slightly worse ECE compared to Temperature Scaling. As a result, Temperature Scaling - which does not contain class-specific parameters - has become the dominant approach in the literature. An important contribution of our paper is to show that Temperature Scaling is not the best choice for domain adaptation to label shift.\n\nWe make two contributions to the EM algorithm itself. The first is a theoretically principled strategy for computing the source-domain priors that substantially improves the robustness of the algorithm in situations where the predicted probabilities retain systematic bias. The second, requested by Reviewer 2, is a proof showing that maximizing the likelihood is a convex optimization problem - thus, we can expect EM will converge to a global optimum.\n\nWe hope you will revisit this submission with the above considerations in mind.\n\n \n[1] Zhang, Kun, Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, Krikamol Muandet, and Zhikun Wang. \"Domain adaptation under target and conditional shift.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 819-827. 2013.\n\n[2] Lipton, Zachary C., Yu-Xiang Wang, and Alex Smola. \"Detecting and correcting for label shift with black box predictors.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03916 (2018).\n\n[3] Azizzadenesheli, Kamyar, Anqi Liu, Fanny Yang, and Animashree Anandkumar. \"Regularized learning for domain adaptation under label shifts.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.09734 (2019).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adapting to Label Shift with Bias-Corrected Calibration", "authors": ["Avanti Shrikumar", "Amr M.

Specifically:\n\n\u201cThey consider JS divergence as a metric for evaluation. But they don\u2019t consider other metrics like the error in weight estimates which is considered in most of the prior work\u201d + \u201cThey don\u2019t compare their results with regularizations suggested on top of BBSE, particularly Azizzadenesheli et al.\u201d\nWe have included Regularized Learning under Label Shift (RLLS) by Azizzadenesheli et al. and have added the mean squared error in weight estimates as a metric. We find that our overall conclusions are strengthened: when the predictions are not well calibrated, EM produces mixed results and RLLS has a tendency to achieve the best results. However, when Bias-Corrected Temperature Scaling or Vector Scaling are used for calibration, EM tends to outperform both BBSL and RLLS (for consistency with the prior literature, we have replaced our references to \u201cBBSE\u201d with \u201cBBSL\u201d in the manuscript). Because BBSL and RLLS are considered the state-of-the-art among computationally scalable methods for label shift estimation, we can now state that our proposed hybrid approach of EM + bias-corrected calibration achieves state-of-the-art results in our experiments.\n\n\u201cThey compare methods for particularly limited ranges of Dirichlet shift (\\alpha=0.1, 1.0). What happens when the \\alpha increases to have less severe shifts?\u201d\nWe have added \\alpha=10 to the tables for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 in the main text. We find that the overall results still hold, but the difference between the methods is less stark than at more severe shifts. In particular, RLLS often does well at less severe shifts. This suggests possible extensions where the shift estimated by EM could be regularized, possibly by the use of a conjugate prior, so as to achieve better performance.\n\n\u201cOptimizing ELBO with EM can lead to local convergence to the likelihood function when the likelihood is not unimodal. Is this likelihood function unimodal? Does the EM approach converges to MLE under some appropriate initialization and assumptions?\u201d\nWe have included a short proof in Appendix A showing that maximizing the likelihood under the relevant constraints is a convex optimization problem. Thus, we can anticipate EM will converge to the MLE.\n\nWe have also combined some of the tables and expanded the captions to improve presentation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1165/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adapting to Label Shift with Bias-Corrected Calibration", "authors": ["Avanti Shrikumar", "Amr M.

But in this way of reporting the results it is not clear how big calibration can improve the final accuracy.

In particular, calibration approaches that include class-specific bias parameters are significantly better than approaches that lack class-specific bias parameters, suggesting that reducing systematic bias in the calibrated probabilities is especially important for domain adaptation.", "pdf": "/pdf/76083ca2b4b126af16251b5b503327ed8b7e0afd.pdf", "code": "https://github.com/blindauth/labelshiftexperiments", "paperhash": "shrikumar|adapting_to_label_shift_with_biascorrected_calibration", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b5e9c48ecd522fa78cce36db3723065d9abf0745.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nshrikumar2020adapting,\ntitle={Adapting to Label Shift with Bias-Corrected Calibration},\nauthor={Avanti Shrikumar and Amr M.
