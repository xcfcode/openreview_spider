The basic idea seems interesting, but unfortunately in the present form he paper is very difficult to appreciate, as it lacks of important details concerning methodology, experimental results, and comparison with respect to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the manuscript still appears in a draft form. Sentences are often broken, the text presents many typos and grammar mistakes, and the citations are not understandable. \n\nMissing methodological details are grouped in the following parts of this review.\n\nSection 3.2 Encoder\nParagraph 2: The authors claim that they introduce the knowledge of migration learning without explaining it. Where does this concept come from? Is there a literature about it or is this a new concept?\n\nMedical images are fitted though a variational auto encoder (VAE) (citation missing). The encoder description is minimal and lacks of implementation details (see Eq. 3), while the decoder description is missing throughout the paper. \n\nEq. (2): the authors write that they obtain a distribution p(x) according to Eq. (2), but this equation is just the formula for the sample mean, where p(x) is sampled and not computed.\n\nEq. (3): f1 and f2 are never made explicit in the paper so we do not know if they are linear or non-linear functions. The prior p(Z) is decomposed as a summation of posteriors p(Z|X) and the choice to have these posteriors equal to N(0,1) (1-dimensional, which is unusual) regardless of the data point X is not explained.\n\nSection 3.3 Feature extraction memory module\nFeature extraction from industrial images is done through principal component analysis (PCA). In the same paragraph is written that features are extracted through convolution neural networks (CNN). So it is not clear if there is an arbitrary choice to use PCA or CNN, and what are the conditions when this happens.\n\nEq. (6): the score between z_t (medical image distribution) and y_s (industrial image feature vector) is computed as scalar product dot(z_t , W_a * y_s). The key link is the linear mapping W_a, which is never made explicit in the paper. How do the authors compute W_a ?\n\nSection 4.1 Implementation details\nthe networks called \u201cidentification network\u201d and \u201cfront-end network\u201d are not well defined. They may refer to the  VAE, the CNN, the Adversarial Nets. There is too much ambiguity. A captioned figure can help in resolving the ambiguities.\n\nSection 4.2 Dataset\nIn the first paragraph the authors cite a dataset of CT images, while the main focus of the paper is on PET images. How the CT images comes into play?\n\nSection 4.3 Evaluation\nThe authors compare their method with respect to other three methods, namely VAE, DCGAN, and WGAN.\nThe implementation details of the competing methods are not described so we cannot be sure about the fairness of the comparison.\n\n\nOther considerations\nIntroduction, 4th paragraph: \u201cimaging quality is higher\u201d With respect to what? Usually PET images have the worst quality in the medical domain.\nIntroduction, 3rd-to-last paragraph: \u201cWe use the medical CT image ...\u201d. Should be PET images\n\nRelated work: This section is a list of works and the relation with the current paper is not highlighted.\n\u201clung cancer cakes\u201d what are they?\n\nParagraph 3.2: \u201cexcessive pursuit of quality\u201d why is it bad? \u201cmigration learning\u201d do they mean transfer learning? Equation 2 and 3 in relation to a clustering problem never pointed out before in the paper.\n\nParagraph 4.1. What is the meaning of \u201cAdam algorithm(=0.5)\u201d ?\n\nFigures 1 and 2 have very minimal captions. What do they represent?\n\nCitation formatting problem: name and surname are switched.

The structure of the paper is as follows: firstly, we encode to get the hidden vectors of medical CT images based on transfer Learning, and use PCA to extract positron image features. Secondly, we construct a positron image memory based on attention mechanism as a whole input to the adversarial nets which uses medical hidden variables as a query. Finally, we train the whole model jointly and update the input parameters until convergence. Experiments have proved the possibility of generating rare positron images for industrial non-destructive testing using countermeasure networks, and good imaging results have been achieved.", "pdf": "/pdf/ec84da186c47d5983042e4bfe010bdb6baeeba64.pdf", "paperhash": "zhu|generative_adversarial_networks_for_data_scarcity_industrial_positron_images_with_attention", "original_pdf": "/attachment/ec84da186c47d5983042e4bfe010bdb6baeeba64.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhu2020generative,\ntitle={Generative Adversarial Networks For Data Scarcity Industrial Positron Images With Attention},\nauthor={Mingwei Zhu and Min Zhao and Min Yao and Ruipeng Guo},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkxcSpEKPS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
