Firstly, the prior is specified as a mixture distribution with one component per class (SVAE).  During training, the ELBO\u2019s KL term uses the component that corresponds to the known label.  Secondly, the DDT\u2019s leaves are parametrized with the encoder distribution q(z|x), and thus gradient information flows back through the DDT into the posterior approximations in order to make them more discriminative.  Lastly, the VAE and DDT are trained together by alternating optimization of each component (plus a ridge penalty on the decoder means).  Experiments are performed on MNIST, demonstrating tree classification performance, (supervised) neg. log likelihood performance, and latent space interpretability via the DDT.  \n\n\nEvaluation\n\nPros:  Giving the VAE discriminative capabilities is an interesting line of research, and this paper provides another take on tree-based VAEs, which are challenging to define given the discrete nature of the former and continuous nature of the latter.  Thus, I applaud the authors for combining the two in a way that admits efficient training.  Moreover, I like the qualitative experiment (Figure 2) in which the tree is used to vary a latent dimension to change the digit\u2019s class.  I can see this being used for dataset augmentation or adversarial example generation, for instance.\n\nCons:  An indefensible flaw in the work is that the model is evaluated on only MNIST.  As there is no strong theory in the paper, this limited experimental evaluation is reason enough for rejection.  Yet, moreover, the negative log likelihood comparison (Table 2) is not an informative comparison, as it speaks only to the power of adding supervision.  Lastly, I do not think the interpretability provided by the decision tree is as great as the authors seem to claim.  Decision trees provide rich and interpretable structure only when each input feature has clear semantics.  However, in this case, the latent space is being used as input to the tree.  As the decision tree, then, is merely learning hard, class-based partitioning rules for the latent space, I do not see how the tree is representing anything especially revealing.  Taking Figure 2 as an example (which I do like the end result of), I could generate similar results with a black-box classifier by using gradients to perturb the latent \u20184\u2019 mean into a latent \u20187\u2019 mean (a la DeepDream).  I could then identify the influential dimension(s) by taking the largest absolute values in the gradient vector.  Maybe there is another use case in which a decision tree is superior; I\u2019m just saying Section 4.3 doesn\u2019t convince me to the extent that was promised earlier in the paper (and by the title).\n\nComment:  It's easier to make a latent variable model interpretable when the latent variables are given clear semantics in the model definition, in my opinion.  Otherwise, the semantics of the latent space become too entangled.  Could you, somehow, force the tree to encode an identifiable attribute at each node, which would then force that attribute to be encoded in a certain dimension of latent space?      \n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpretable Classification via Supervised Variational Autoencoders and Differentiable Decision Trees", "abstract": "As deep learning-based classifiers are increasingly adopted in real-world applications, the importance of understanding how a particular label is chosen grows.

The problem is important and interesting. The authors list the contributions of each part but it seems that only the final contribution, i.e. analysis of the interpretability, is interesting and should be further extended and emphasized. Here with the detailed comments.\n\n1. I think Table 2 does not make sense at all. This is not only because the authors use the label information but also because the authors compare different quantities. The the previous methods evaluate log p(x) while the proposed method evaluates log p(x, y) which should be much lower as the proposed method potentially trains a separated model for each class of the x for evaluation.\n\n2. The generation results of the SVAE shown in Figure 7 in Appendix A seem strange as the diversity of the samples is much less than those from the vanilla VAEs. Could the authors explain this mode collapse phenomenon? \n\n3. The results in Table 1 are not interesting.  It is most useful to interpret the state-of-the-art classifier while the results of the proposed methods are far from the state-of-the-art even on such simple MNIST dataset.\n\n4. The most interesting results of this paper are shown in Figure 1. However, I think the results on the interpretability should be further extended. Several questions are as follows: \n\nWhy other dimensions are not so interpretable, compared with 21?\n\nCan we also interpret a VAE given labels by varying each dimension of the latent variables without jointly training a DTT? I personally think some of the dimensions of the latent variables of the vanilla VAEs can also be interpreted via interpolation in each dimension. \n\nCan these results be generalized to other datasets, consisting of natural images? \n\nOverall, this paper is below the acceptance threshold.\n ", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpretable Classification via Supervised Variational Autoencoders and Differentiable Decision Trees", "abstract": "As deep learning-based classifiers are increasingly adopted in real-world applications, the importance of understanding how a particular label is chosen grows.
