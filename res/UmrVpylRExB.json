It proposes to replace the lower layers with dual tree wavelet packet transforms, which yield fixed oriented frequency-selective features. Instead of learning filters from scratch, it proposes to learn only a scalar importance for each of these features, reducing the number of learned parameters. Experiments with the AlexNet architecture on ImageNet indicate that this modification does not reduce performance, but does significantly reduce the number of parameters. The paper argues that this modification also improves the interpretability (and in the case of complex dual tree wavelets, potentially the invariance properties) of the low-level features. \n\nPros and cons:\n\n[+/-] As the paper clearly argues, replacing learned filters with wavelet packet transforms improves the interpretability of the low layers of a convolutional network. While other works have pursued similar ideas, limiting the conceptual novelty, at a technical level this is the first work to use the dual tree complex wavelet transform for this purpose. The DT-CWT may have mathematical advantages. The paper and rebuttal argue that it it is conceptually cleaner (\u201csparser\u201d, since the transform is generated by a single filter) although there may not be a greater reduction in the number of trainable parameters.\n\n[+] The additional per-channel weights are redundant in terms of the representation capacity of the network, but may effectively introduce sparse regularization (see work on the \u201cHadamard parameterization\u201d in implicit sparse regularization), allowing the network to select relevant wavelet features.\n\n[+] The paper is well-organized and cleanly written. The authors revision has done a good job of addressing all clarity concerns of reviewers. \n\n[-] Several reviewers raised concerns about the limited scope of the experiments: the paper only replaces a single layer of a particular architecture (AlexNet) and evaluates on one particular dataset (ImageNet). \n\n[-] The main proposed benefit of this modification is in the interpretability of the network and its potential amenability to mathematical analysis. This claim would be stronger if the paper either 1. showed the benefit by exhibiting some rudimentary mathematical theory for this network or 2. used this idea to demonstrate networks that are significantly more interpretable, say by replacing all learned convolutional layers with DT-CWPT. \n\nThe paper\u2019s reviews were split. All reviewers appreciate the paper\u2019s clean exposition of a reasonable idea, and note the novelty of using dual tree wavelets in this context. However, reviewers express concerns about the paper\u2019s significance: it could do more to show how replacing the lowest layer with DT-CWPT yields new insights, and do more to demonstrate (both rhetorically and experimentally) the generality of its ideas. Based on the bulk of the reviews, as written the paper falls slightly below the threshold for acceptance.

[...]\n\n> [...] the paper refers to some previous work on replacing freely-trained CNN layers with more constrained structures. What is the advantage of the proposed work over the existing ones?\n\nOur main insight is to describe the observed behavior of CNNs with a sparse model, and explain their predictive power using the feature extraction properties of the WPT or DT-CWPT (see below). The goal for the models proposed by Oyallon et al. (2018) is very different. They do not attempt to imitate the behavior of existing models \u2013 linear convolutions are replaced by a non-linear transform \u2013 but instead aim to improve inference speed and memory consumption.\n\nOther works like Sarwar et al. (2017) and Ulicny et al. (2019) introduce Gabor filters and discrete cosine transforms, respectively, into convolutional layers. Similar to these transforms, our wavelet packet filters are well localized in the frequency domain and share a subsampling factor over the output feature maps. A major advantage with our approach is sparsity: a single vector (called conjugate mirror filter, or CMF) is sufficient to characterize the whole process. In addition, DT-CWPT extracts oriented and shift-invariant features with minimal redundancy. These properties therefore provide a sparser description of the observed behavior of convolutional layers. This is a step toward a more complete description of CNNs by using a small number of arbitrary parameters.\n\nTo provide additional evidence, we are in the process of evaluating the robustness of our models with respect to sample shifts. We will also test out-of-distribution transfer by using our pre-trained models on other datasets. This is ongoing, and we will provide an update before Nov 24.\n\n> [...] AlexNet is not SOTA nor near SOTA, and the adaption of such a benchmark does not seem to provide persuasive results.\n\nSince our goal was not to merely improve CNN performance, we did not work on SOTA networks. Instead, we focused on the first layer of AlexNet as a proof of concept, because introducing wavelet packet transform into it is facilitated by its large 11x11 kernels, and convolution operations performed with a downsampling factor of 4. This allows two levels of wavelet decomposition without any additional transformation. However, the oscillating patterns in trained convolutional kernels do not restrict to the first layer, nor are they specific to AlexNet. We strongly believe that our model could be adapted to deeper layers and more recent architectures. The transposition is not trivial though, because the stride is typically set to 2 in most convolutional layers (vs 4 in AlexNet). Wavelet decomposition must be handled carefully to match the original layer\u2019s hyperparameters. This will be tackled as part of future work.\n\n> In the proposed networks, only the first layer of AlexNet is replaced, but most of the parameters are in the deeper layers, especially the FC layers. It is hard to see the advantage of such a reduction of trainable parameters.\n\nOur method reduces the total number of parameters \u2013 FC layers are outside the scope of this work. The primary goal of our work is not to reduce inference time or memory consumption, even though it is a step in that direction. Instead, we seek to describe the behavior of convolutional layers with a sparse model, taking advantage of the feature extraction properties of the dual-tree wavelet packet transform. We may not have made this point very clear in the initial submission, and clarified it in the updated version.\n\n> Only one dataset is used, and we do not know how the filters would be affected when applied to a different dataset.\n\nAs mentioned above, we are in the process of training our models on other datasets and will provide an update before Nov 24. We will compare the accuracy scores of models trained from scratch with those of ImageNet-pre-trained models after finetuning.\n\n> Do other choices of CMFs generate different results?\n\nSo far we trained our models with a Q-shift filter of length 10, but other filters may provide better extraction properties due to a higher frequency localization or number of vanishing moments. One way to address this question is to let the network learn the optimal CMF with a proper regularizer.

It shows that the composition of two CNN-style multi-channel convolution operators can be expressed as a single operator, and provides an explicit formulation of the resulting hyperparameters (i.e., stride, dilation factor and no. of groups describing input-output channel connections) and the weight tensor. While not groundbreaking, this result was needed for analysis \u2013 section 3.3 shows a visual representation of the resulting kernels; besides, in future work we will quantify their similarities and study how it impacts the network\u2019s predictive power. Since we could not find it written in this form in the literature, we presented it in our work. Nevertheless, we understand that qualifying this result as \"theorem\" may be too strong. We have renamed it \"proposition\" in the updated version of our paper, clarifying that it is not shown as a new result.\n\n> I also do not see any evidence that the authors intend to publish the code for this experiment.\n\nWe have inadvertently omitted this point; thank you for letting us know. We intend to publish our source code, as mentioned in the updated version.\n\n> [...] a potential subtlety here that needs to be addressed, is the behavior at the edge: [...] This potential issue is not discussed in the main text nor in the proof of the theorem.\n\nIn this proposition, we implicitly made a hypothesis which is not satisfied when using symmetric padding. Nevertheless, distortion effects only appear at the edges of images; and the property holds everywhere else. We leave the study of the influence of such choice on the network\u2019s predictive power for future work.\n\n> While important, similar results have been established before (by Oyallon et al., 2018, for example), and it is not clear what the wavelet packet approach brings to the table.[...]\n\nOur main insight is to describe the observed behavior of CNNs with a sparse model, and explain their predictive power using the feature extraction properties of the WPT or DT-CWPT (see below). The goal for the models proposed by Oyallon et al. (2018) is very different. They do not attempt to imitate the behavior of existing models \u2013 linear convolutions are replaced by a non-linear transform \u2013 but instead aim to improve inference speed and memory consumption.\n\nOther works like Sarwar et al. (2017) and Ulicny et al. (2019) introduce Gabor filters and discrete cosine transforms, respectively, into convolutional layers. Similar to these transforms, our wavelet packet filters are well localized in the frequency domain and share a subsampling factor over the output feature maps. A major advantage with our approach is sparsity: a single vector (called conjugate mirror filter, or CMF) is sufficient to characterize the whole process. In addition, DT-CWPT extracts oriented and shift-invariant features with minimal redundancy. These properties therefore provide a sparser description of the observed behavior of convolutional layers. This is a step toward a more complete description of CNNs by using a small number of arbitrary parameters.\n\n> Section 4.3 [...] Since the outlined scheme is rather simple, why have the authors not tried it? [...] Similarly, the authors speculate that the dual-tree real wavelet packets perform worse than the complex variant due to higher sensitivity to image shifts. Whether this is the case can be easily tested experimentally by shifting the images in the test set.\n\nWe did try to train reduced models (by discarding some filters) on a subset of ImageNet, for computational reasons. It turns out that the drop in accuracy remained negligible even when reducing the number of parameters aggressively. While this seems hopeful, the dataset may have been too small to draw any strong conclusions. We thus decided to leave for future work the task of optimizing the number of trainable parameters. For clarity, we now moved this paragraph to a \u201cFuture work\u201d section in the revised version.\n\nRegarding the hypothesis on shift invariance, we are in the process of evaluating this and will provide an update before Nov 24.\n\n> There are also a few small problems in the main text [...].\n\nThank you for pointing these out.

Interesting but lack of explanations and comparisons.", "review": "To improve the understanding of CNNs, this paper proposes a method to constrain the behavior of AlexNet by replacing its first layer with a module based on wavelet packet decompositions. Three variants of wavelet decompositions are evaluated, including the separable wavelet packet transform and the 2D dual-tree real and complex wavelet packet transforms. A visualization algorithm is implemented to compare the extracted features with that of AlexNet. Results on an image classification task show that the accuracy of standard AlexNet can be achieved with less trainable parameters. \n\nPros:\n+ It is interesting to see the combined convolutional kernels, as shown in figure 3, resembles that of AlexNet. \n+ The paper presents some intuitive explanations on some aspects of the results, including (1) why and how the proposed DT-CWPT module can reduce the number of trainable parameters, with the accuracy rate maintained compared with standard AlexNet, and (2) why the three variants differ in accuracy. \n\nCons:\n- The insight provided by this paper is vague, and it is not so clear how this can improve our understanding of CNNs (which was claimed as one of the contributions). Furthermore, what is the benefit of replacing the first layer of AlexNet with pre-designed non-trainable convolutions? Do we have better adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution transfer, etc.? \n- The experimental results of the paper do not seem very convincing. \n(1) Despite the reasons stated in the first paragraph of page 2, AlexNet is not SOTA nor near SOTA, and the adaption of such a benchmark does not seem to provide persuasive results. \n(2) In the proposed networks, only the first layer of AlexNet is replaced, but most of the parameters are in the deeper layers, especially the FC layers. It is hard to see the advantage of such a reduction of trainable parameters. \n- Lack of experiments. \n(1) Only one dataset is used, and we do not know how the filters would be affected when applied to a different dataset. \n(2) Do other choices of CMFs generate different results? \n(3) In the introduction, the paper refers to some previous work on replacing freely-trained CNN layers with more constrained structures. What is the advantage of the proposed work over the existing ones? \n\nFurther Questions:\n* In figure 3, only filters of the red channel (i.e., $W[0,\\cdot]$) are shown. But readers could also be interested in $W[i,\\cdot]$ for $i=1,2$. Maybe a colored visualization of the filters is better. \n* Still figure 3, how exactly is the filter cropping done, and how can we be convinced that the cropped parts of the matrices are negligible, e.g., with small Lp norms? \n* Appendix, algorithm 1: Does $\\langle W_r\\rangle$ mean the shape of the tensor $W_r$? \n* Section 3.1: The number $N'$ in the dimension of $D$ becomes 56 in  $Y$. Does the full-convolution (as defined in section 2) guarantee $N'=56$, or is there a cropping procedure?

The authors show the wavelet packet transform can be written as a series of convolution operation and visually compare the filters of the trained AlexNet to the WPT filters. Experiments on ImageNet show the proposed method can match the performance of AlexNet on ImageNet with fewer parameters.\n\nPros:\nThis work tackles in a focused way the interpretability and formalism of deep neural networks, specifically CNN, by grounding the first layers of the network in the frame work of the wavelet transform.\n\nThe similarities shown in Figure 1 between trained AlexNet kernels and kernels from the proposed method are interesting\n\nThe reduction in learned parameters for the network under the proposed approach is a nice feature, and shows that stronger priors can guide learning.\n\nCons:\nA crucial limitation of the proposed approach seems to be its application only to the first layer of the CNN. It would be interesting to apply the method to multiple layers of the network or in the extreme case, a network based solely on the WPT.\n\nAnother limitation of this work is that the proposed method is not applied to other popular and performant CNN architectures, e.g. ResNet (He et al. 2015), and is only applied to the relatively older AlexNet model.\n\nTo be more convincing, the method must be demonstrated on more datasets or tasks. For example, other image recognition datasets or other tasks (such as ASR). Results on one CNN architecture on one dataset does not fully demonstrate the generalizability of the method.\n\nThe authors show the proposed method reduces the number of learned parameters, however does the method reduce the total number of parameters?

This is motivated by the fact that the first-layer convolutional kernels look very similar to wavelet filters in that they mostly extract oriented edges and smooth gradients. The wavelet packet coefficients are then weighted using a single mixing layer implemented as a 1\u00d71 convolution. The resulting module (wavelet packet decomposition plus 1\u00d71 convolution) has a smaller number of learnable parameters, but achieves close to the same performance as the standard AlexNet on the ImageNet ILSVRC2012 dataset.\n\nThe paper is well laid-out and the important technical concepts are explained in a clear and concise manner. The various wavelet packet modules used to replace the first layer of AlexNet are well described and their differences clear. The same goes for the experimental section and the evaluation of the results. On the theoretical side, I am not sure that the result on page 6 qualifies as \u201ctheorem\u201d \u2013 the fact that two successive convolutions can be written as another convolution with a wider kernel is well-known in the signal processing literature. While the experimental results are impressive, more could also be made out of the analysis. I also do not see any evidence that the authors intend to publish the code for this experiment. Despite these issues, I think the results are interesting enough that the paper be accepted for publication in the proceedings.\n\nAs discussed in the paper, there is a great need for theory explaining the performance of deep neural networks. This work is a step in that direction, reducing the number of learnable components and replacing them with fixed representations (here: wavelet packet decompositions) and achieving the same performance.\n\nRegarding the theorem, again, this is not a new result, fundamentally, and I think this should be made clear. That being said, a potential subtlety here that needs to be addressed, is the behavior at the edge: for large enough kernels, unless the boundary extension is periodic, the composition of two convolution kernels is not necessarily another convolution. This potential issue is not discussed in the main text nor in the proof of the theorem.\n\nCurrently, the main push of the analysis is that the first-layer kernels can be replaced by similar-looking wavelet packet kernels. While important, similar results have been established before (by Oyallon et al., 2018, for example), and it is not clear what the wavelet packet approach brings to the table. Do these filters have certain properties that make them easier to analyze? Is the resulting reduction in number of learnable parameters greater?\n\nSection 4.3 is also a bit odd. It is mostly speculation about how the number of parameters could be reduced further. Since the outlined scheme is rather simple, why have the authors not tried it? Otherwise, I do not quite understand why this section is included. Similarly, the authors speculate that the dual-tree real wavelet packets perform worse than the complex variant due to higher sensitivity to image shifts. Whether this is the case can be easily tested experimentally by shifting the images in the test set. Have the authors explored validating the hypothesis in this manner?\n\nThere are also a few small problems in the main text:\n\u2013 p. 3, in Definition 1, it is not clear how the operator is defined. A reference to eq. (3) should suffice.\n\u2013 p. 4, \u201cevery input channels\u201d should be \u201cevery input channel\u201d.\n\u2013 p. 7, \u201cpredicting power\u201d should probably be \u201cpredictive power\u201d here and throughout.\n\u2013 p. 8, \u201cextract lesser information\u201d should be \u201cextract less information\u201d.\n\u2013 p. 8, \u201cdoes not restricts\u201d should be \u201cdoes not restrict\u201d.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3573/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3573/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dual-Tree Wavelet Packet CNNs for Image Classification", "authorids": ["~Hubert_Leterme1", "kevin.polisano@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr", "valerie.perrier@grenoble-inp.fr", "~Karteek_Alahari1"], "authors": ["Hubert Leterme", "K\u00e9vin Polisano", "Val\u00e9rie Perrier", "Karteek Alahari"], "keywords": ["convolutional neural networks", "wavelet packet transform", "dual-tree wavelet packet transform", "image classification", "deep learning", "image processing"], "abstract": "In this paper, we target an important issue of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) \u2014 the lack of a mathematical understanding of their properties. We present an explicit formalism that is motivated by the similarities between trained CNN kernels and oriented Gabor filters for addressing this problem. The core idea is to constrain the behavior of convolutional layers by splitting them into a succession of wavelet packet decompositions, which are modulated by freely-trained mixture weights. We evaluate our approach with three variants of wavelet decompositions with the AlexNet architecture for image classification as an example. The first variant relies on the separable wavelet packet transform while the other two implement the 2D dual-tree real and complex wavelet packet transforms, taking advantage of their feature extraction properties such as directional selectivity and shift invariance. Our experiments show that we achieve the accuracy rate of standard AlexNet, but with a significantly lower number of parameters, and an interpretation of the network that is grounded in mathematical theory.", "one-sentence_summary": "We introduce the dual-tree wavelet packet transform into convolutional neural networks in order to constrain their behavior while keeping their predicting power.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "leterme|dualtree_wavelet_packet_cnns_for_image_classification", "pdf": "/pdf/8797c50437804b0b3888915a5ab2faa982f59ca1.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=82Y-rMthk", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nleterme2021dualtree,\ntitle={Dual-Tree Wavelet Packet {\\{}CNN{\\}}s for Image Classification},\nauthor={Hubert Leterme and K{\\'e}vin Polisano and Val{\\'e}rie Perrier and Karteek Alahari},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=UmrVpylRExB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
