In addition, synthetic datasets can be easily generated for community detection. Therefore, we think it is a good testbed for comparing different algorithms. However, it is a very good point that GNN and LGNN can be applied to other node-wise classification problems as well. We will modify the text to highlight this point. \n \n\u201cTo make sure the actual gain of LGNN, this needs be done with some ablation studies.\u201d\n \nThis is a valid suggestion. You correctly pointed out that GAT does not utilize the degree matrix directly, and so we are planning to perform ablation experiments by removing the degree matrix from GNN and LGNN.  We did add spatial batch normalization steps to the GAT and MPNN models we used, and in the experiments we found that spatial batch normalization is crucial for the performance of the models including GNN, LGNN, GAT and MPNN. The reason for this is outlined at the end of Section 4.1, in which we assimilate the spatial normalization with removing the DC component of node features, which is aligned with the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of leading eigenvalue. \n\n \n \u201cThe performance gain is not so significant compared to other simpler baselines, so the net contribution of the line-graph extension is unclear considering the above.\u201d\n \nAlthough not all differences in the results are statistically significant (where we consider 2 sigma to be significant), we still think it is worth noting that in all of the experiments (binary SBM, 5-class dissociative SBM, GBM and SNAP data), LGNN achieved better averaged performance than all other algorithms, including GNN without line graph included. We also note that the complexity in operations/memory of using LGNN is the same as the alternative edge-learning methods we compared against, so these gains come essentially for free.\n \n\"The experimental section considers only a few number of classes (2-5) so that it\u2019s does not show how it scales with a large number of classes\"\n \nThis is indeed an interesting direction for future research. We will highlight this current limitation and discuss possible routes.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1222/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1222/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1222/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Supervised Community Detection with Line Graph Neural Networks", "abstract": "Community detection in graphs can be solved via spectral methods or posterior inference under certain probabilistic graphical models.

It has a form of learning directed edge features for message-passing. An energy landscape analysis of the LGNN is also provided under linear assumptions. The performance of LGNN is evaluated on the problem of community detection, comparing with some baseline methods. \n\nI appreciate the LGNN formulation as a reasonable and nice extension of GNN. The formulation is clearly written and properly discussed with message passing algorithms and other GNNs. Its potential hierarchical construction is also interesting, and maybe useful for large-scale graphs. In the course of reading this paper, however, I don\u2019t find any clear reason why this paper restricts itself to community detection, rather than general node-classification problems for broader audience. It would have been more interesting if it covers other classification datasets in their experiments. \n\nMost of the weak points of this paper lie in the experimental section. \n1. The experimental sections do not have proper ablation studies, e.g., as follows.   \nAs commented in Sec 6.3, GAT may underperform due to the absence of the degree matrix and this needs to be confirmed by running GAT with the degree term. And, as commented in footnote 4, the authors used spatial batch normalization to improve the performance of LGNN. But, it\u2019s not clear how much it obtains for each experiment and, more importantly, whether they use the same spatial batch norm in other baselines. To make sure the actual gain of LGNN, this needs be done with some ablation studies. \n2. The performance gain is not so significant compared to other simpler baselines, so the net contribution of  the line-graph extension is unclear considering the above. \n3. The experimental section considers only a few number of classes (2-5) so that it\u2019s does not show how it scales with a large number of classes. In this sense, other benchmark datasets with more classes (e.g., PPI datasets used in GAT paper) would be better. \n\nI hope to get answers to these.

A couple of misleading statements to be adjusted. ", "review": "This paper presents a study of the community detection problem via graph neural networks. The presented results open the possibility that neural networks are able to discover the optimal algorithm for a given task. This is rather convincingly demonstrated on the example of the stochastic block model, where the optimal performance is known (for 2 symmetric groups) or strongly conjectured (for more groups). The method is rather computationally demanding, and also somewhat unrealistic in the aspect that the training examples might not be available, but for a pioneering study of this kind this is well acceptable.\n\nDespite my overall very positive opinion, I found a couple of claims that are misleading and overall hurt the quality of the paper, and I would strongly suggest to the authors to adjust these claims:\n\n** The method is claimed to \"even improve upon current computational thresholds in hard regimes.\" This is misleading, because (as correctly stated in the body of the paper) the computational threshold to which the paper refers apply in the limit of large graph sizes whereas the observed improvements are for finite sizes. It is shown here that for finite sizes the present method is better than belief propagation. But this clearly does not imply that it improves the conjectured computational thresholds that are asymptotic. At best this is an interesting hypothesis for future work, not more. \n\n** The energy landscape is analyzed \"under certain simplifications and assumptions\". Conclusions state \"an interesting transition from rugged to simple as the size of the graphs increase under appropriate concentration conditions.\" This is very vague. It would be great if the paper could offer intuitive explanation of there simplifications and assumptions that is between these unclear remarks and the full statement of the theorem and the proof that I did not find simple to understand. For instance state the intuition on in which region of parameters are those results true and in which they are not. \n\n** \"multilinear fully connected neural networks whose landscape is well understood (Kawaguchi, 2016).\" this is in my opinion grossly overstated. While surely that paper presents interesting results, they are set in a regime that lets a lot to be still understood about landscape of fully connected neural networks. It is restricted to specific activation functions, and the results for non-linear networks rely on unjustified simplifications, the sample complexity trade-off is not considered, etc. \n\n\nMisprint: Page 2: cetain -> certain. \n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1222/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Supervised Community Detection with Line Graph Neural Networks", "abstract": "Community detection in graphs can be solved via spectral methods or posterior inference under certain probabilistic graphical models.
