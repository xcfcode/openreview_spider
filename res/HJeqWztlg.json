As a result, we have made several modifications to the paper. We address your concerns below.\n\n- Regarding relevant literature, we have added the necessary ``related work'' section, where we discuss all the papers that you mentioned and a few more (including AND-OR trees, grammars, deep rendering model, sum-product networks, etc). Despite each of those approaches having different advantages and disadvantages, all of them (with rare exceptions like Noisy-Or component Analysis, which we compare with and the deep rendering model, which we also discuss now), share a common limitation that HCN does not have: they cannot render overlapping features. HCN allows multiple features to overlap, thus creating new compositions. For instance, if feature H is a centered horizontal line and feature V is a centered vertical line, HCN can create a new feature ``cross'' that combines both, and the fact that both are overlapping and sharing a common active pixel (and many common inactive pixels) is properly handled. In contrast, previous models cannot overlap features, so they partition the input space and dedicate separate subtrees to each of them, and do so recursively. We can see in Figure 5, top row, how we can generate 25 different cross variations using only two features. This would not be possible with the existing feature learning models mentioned in your review (with the given exception), which would need to span each combination as a separate feature.\n\nRegarding the deep rendering model (DRM), it is to some extent, a continuous counterpart of the present work. Although DRMs allow for feature overlap, the semantics are different: in HCN the amount of activation of a given pixel is the same whether there are one or many features (causes) activating it, whereas in DRM the activation is proportional to the number of causes. This means that the difference between DRM and HCN is analogous to the difference between principal component analysis and binary matrix factorization: while the first can be solved analytically, the second is hard and not analytically tractable. This results in DRM being more tractable, but less appropriate to handle problems with binary events with multiple causes, such as the ones posed in this paper.\n\n- Regarding the ''false novelty claim'': we have failed to find any existing algorithm capable of finding the parts Figure 1 (left) in the paper like HCN does. Note that the disentangled features are overlapping and binary, so none of the papers mentioned in your review could successfully disentangle them, even from a theoretical perspective. Furthermore, it can be seen that HCN can solve, as a concrete specialization, binary matrix factorization problems, whereas (for the same reason, lack of a model with multiple causes producing a single binary event, which would require explaining away for inference) none of the models you mentioned can be used for this task. We have therefore not removed the novelty claim.\n\nWe implemented the AND-OR templates of Wu et al., and the results show that their method does not disentangle the features like HCN. Instead, their methods keeps prototypes from the input data and cleans them up. (These results are now part of the Appendices.) Theoretical investigation of the other methods you cited also led us to the same conclusion -- they do not disentangle the features. We would be happy to run any code that you might be aware of on our toy data (Figure 1, left) and report the results.\n\n- HCN was designed to solve binary problems and not for real-valued data.  However, given the interest of multiple reviewers in its applicability to continuous images, we decided to provide a simple extension to test whether it would be able to real-valued data. To this end, we added a preprocessing step with a bank of Gabor filters and fed it with grayscale compositional data. The result is that the extended HCN is able to disentangle the features. These results are now part of the Appendices.\n\n- Regarding VAEs and GANs, they could in principle be applied to learn the HCN model. We are not aware of any work that uses a VAE or GAN with a generative model like HCN and such an option is unlikely to be straightforward, for the reasons that follow.\n\nMost common VAEs rely on the reparameterization trick for variance reduction. However, this trick cannot be applied to HCN due to the discrete nature of its variables, and alternative methods would suffer from high variance. Another limitation of VAEs wrt HCN is that they perform a single bottom-up pass and lack explaining away: During learning HCN combines top-down and bottom-up information in multiple passes, isolating the parent cause of a given activation, instead of activating every possible cause.\n\nGANs need to compute the gradient of  D(G_W(eps)) where D() is the discriminative network and G_W(eps) is a generative network parameterized by the features W. In this case, not only W is binary, but also the generated reconstructions at every layer, so the GAN formulation cannot be applied to HCN as-is. One could in principle relax the binary assumption of features and reconstructions and use the GAN paradigm to train a neural network with sigmoidal activations, but it is unclear that the lack of binary variables will still produce proper disentangling.\n\n- Other comments:\n\n+ \"the paper claims that after learning inference is feed-forward, but since message passing is used, it should be a recurrent network.\"\n\nAfter learning, approximate inference can be performed by a single forward message propagation. Messages are passed on to the next level only once, and the resulting computations can in fact be performed by a convolutional neural network with linear activations, run only once. There is no recurrency in this forward pass. Inference results can be improved with multiple forward and backward passes, in which case the equivalence with a feedforward network disappears.\n\n+ \"the algorithm and tech discussion should be moved from the appendix to the main paper\"\n\nDone.\n\n+ \"the introduction claims that compression is a prove for understanding. I disagree with this statement, and should be removed.\"\n\nDone.\n\n+ \"I'll also like to see a discussion relating the proposed approach to the Deep Rendering model.\"\n\nDone, included in the ``related work'' section.\n\n+ \"It is not obvious how some of the constraints are satisfied during message passing. Also constraints are well known to be difficult to optimize with max product. How do you handle this?\"\n\nEach factors establishes constraints on the variables it is connected to, which in turn define the max-product update equations. When the max-product updates are iterated, the energy of the whole system is minimized. Because breaking a constraint would be equivalent to infinite energy, its minimization results in most constraints being satisfied. If the global optimum of the energy function was found, every constraint would be satisfied (since by construction there is always a valid solution). However, max-product is not guaranteed to converge to the optimum of the energy function (or even converge at all) and therefore there is no guarantee of all the constraints being satisfied by simply rounding the beliefs of its solution. The beliefs will be approximately satisfying the solution, though. What we do then is simply round the beliefs (binarize) at the top and propagate top-down, round the beliefs at the next layer and propagate top-down again, and so on. That procedure (like ancestral sampling) is guaranteed to satisfy all constraints.\n\n+ \"The learning and inference algorithms seems to be very heuristic (e.g., clipping to 1, heuristics on which messages are run). Could you analyze the choices you make?\"\n\nOn the contrary, the algorithm is standard max-product with a particular message propagation schedule. We do not clip any messages. After max-product is run in the HCN, the beliefs must be rounded to 0 or 1, which is the standard final step needed after solving any continuous relaxation of a binary problem (like loopy max-product). The 0.5 threshold is not arbitrary, and is standard for binary problems solved using max-product.\n\nRegarding the order in which messages are run, this is a scheduling problem for which we do not know the best answer. Propagating the messages in random order would also work, but would take much longer. The idea is to propagate the information as quickly as possible between the bottom and the top of the network, while proceeding sequentially inside each layer to allow local decisions influence others (for instance, to solve explaining away).\n\n+ \"doing multiple steps of 5) 2) is not a single backward pass\"\n\nCorrected."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchical compositional feature learning", "abstract": "We introduce the hierarchical compositional network (HCN), a directed generative model able to discover and disentangle, without supervision, the building blocks of a set of binary images.

We have modified the paper to address your comments. Also, see the responses below.\n\nThe goal of the paper is to  disentangle the hierarchical features that compose a binary image in an unsupervised manner. We manage to do so in several examples that, as far as we know, cannot be solved by another method. We do not claim to approach the state of the art in image classification. The experiments on MNIST highlight the interesting fact that this type of feature learning provides additional resistance to unseen clutter, i.e., shows the advantages of a strong structured prior. Of course, in the regular discriminative setting, HCN is not the right tool to address MNIST or any other image classification task.\n\nEven though HCN was designed to analyze the structure of binary data, we believe the extension to real-valued data should be easy. To show this, we added a preprocessing step with a bank of Gabor filters and fed it with grayscale compositional data. We tested the same exact setup with an alternative feature learning technique, the AND-OR templates of Wu et al. The result is that the extended HCN is able to disentangle the features, whereas the baseline cannot. These results are now part of the Appendices.\n\nRegarding the nature of the extracted features, we did not claim in the paper that the features would be \"semantically meaningful\". However, the following constraints on the model is likely to produce features that are compositional: a) non-negativity constraints as in NMF b) directed connections that allow for explaining away c) alternating feature detection and pooling as in CNNs.\n\nDiscovering the letters is the correct answer for the example shown in the paper because we know how the images were generated. Recovering the true generative model is an important step, and we show that the model constraints and learning algorithm is sufficient to do this. This is irrespective of the contention regarding semantic meaning, which we do not claim.\n\nRecovering the true generative model also means finding the most compressive representation of data. Even when it comes to recovering \"semantically meaningful features\", recovering the true generative model for a process that also respects the causal semantics of data generation is likely to be an important aspect. Modeling causal aspects require directed connections as in the HCN, and learning with directed connections has been recognized as a hard problem even on seemingly simple datasets.

There are few directly comparable works, in the sense of modeling capabilities. For instance, grammars exclude the sharing of sub-parts among multiple objects or object parts in a parse of the scene see [Jin & Geman (2006)], and they limit interpretations to single trees even if those are dynamic [Williams & Adams (1999)]. Our graphical model formulation makes the sharing of lower-level features explicit by using local conditional probability distributions for multi-parent interactions, and allows for MAP configurations (i.e, the parse graphs) that are not trees. \n\nIn a nutshell, the difference between in HCN and previous feature learning works (with rare exceptions, like NOCA, with which we compare), is that HCN allows multiple features to overlap, thus creating new compositions.

In the first case (batch), 30 images are presented for 100 epochs (the same 30 images are used epoch after epoch). In the second case (on-line), minibatches of 5 images are processed and then discarded, until a total of 3000 different images have been presented to HCN.

However, 6.(e) shows a more accurate recovery of the features since more images have been seen.\n\nIf we want to compare batch and on-line modes when the same number of images are available for both, we can run on-line mode and reuse the same images. This is done in Figure 6.(d). In that case, a total of only 30 images are used (like in batch mode), which are fed in minibatches of size 5 to the network, for 100 epochs (so that the 30 images are presented a total of 100 times). We can see that the quality of the solution in Figure 6.(d) (on-line) is comparable to that of Figure 6.(c) (batch). Again, the computational cost is the same. However, in this case we observed convergence to be faster for the batch mode."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchical compositional feature learning", "abstract": "We introduce the hierarchical compositional network (HCN), a directed generative model able to discover and disentangle, without supervision, the building blocks of a set of binary images.
