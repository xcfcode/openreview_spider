For PV (model formulation: p(word | vector, context)), the vector predicts word with the 'help' of context, so the vector does not have to be very powerful. On the contrary, for DV-uni (model formulation:p(word | vector)), the vector predicts word by itself alone. The vector has to learn everything by itself, which results in more predictive power. Experimental results also have confirmed this (section 3.3 paragraph 2, DV(89.60) outperforms PV(88.73))\n\nExplanations about why we didn\u2019t integrate ngram with PV: \n\nDue to the same reason above, we believe that p(word | vector, context/ngram) will only perform worse. In this formulation, vector predicts words with more 'help' of both context and ngram context. The only formulation we believe may be useful is p(word, context/ngram | vector, context/ngram), but it seems somewhat strange by using context to predict context, and we will study it in our future work.

In this paper, we modify the architecture of the recently proposed Paragraph Vector, allowing it to learn document vectors by predicting not only words, but n-gram features as well. Our model is able to capture both semantics and word order in documents while keeping the expressive power of learned vectors. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset show that our model outperforms previous deep learning models and bag-of-ngram based models due to the above advantages.", "pdf": "/pdf/XL92M93mzhXB8D1RUWBz.pdf", "paperhash": "li|learning_document_embeddings_by_predicting_ngrams_for_sentiment_classification_of_long_movie_reviews", "conflicts": ["a.a.edu"], "authors": ["Bofang Li", "Tao Liu", "Xiaoyong Du", "Deyuan Zhang", "Zhe Zhao"], "authorids": ["libofang@ruc.edu.cn", "tliu@ruc.edu.cn", "duyong@ruc.edu.cn", "dyzhang@sau.edu.cn", "helloworld@ruc.edu.cn"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 6, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 7}
