The key issue in training such models is computing the gradient of the log partition function, which can be framed as computing the expected value of f(x) = dE(x; theta) / d theta over the model distribution p(x). The canonical algorithm for this problem is Contrastive Divergence which approximates x ~ p(x) with k steps of Gibbs sampling, resulting in biased gradients. In this paper, the authors apply the recently introduced unbiased MCMC framework of Jacob et al. to completely remove the bias. The key idea is to (1) rewrite the expectation as a limit of a telescopic sum: E f(x_0) + \\sum_t E f(x_t) - E f(x_{t-1}); (2) run two coupled MCMC chains, one for the \u201cpositive\u201d part of the telescopic sum and one for the \u201cnegative\u201d part until they converge. After convergence, all remaining terms of the sum are zero and we can stop iterating. However, the number of time steps until convergence is now random.\n\nOther contributions of the paper are:\n1. Proof that Bernoulli RBMs and other models satisfying certain conditions have finite expected number of steps and finite variance of the unbiased gradient estimator.\n2. A shared random variables method for the coupled Gibbs chains that should result in faster convergence of the chains.\n3.

The authors demonstrate their method on a toy dataset, simulated data, as well as a reduced version (only the zero digits) of the MNIST dataset and compare the results with the standard Contrastive divergence and Persistent Contrastive Divergence methods.\n\nScore:\nI find the line of work on unbiased estimators important and the (although i\u2019m not an expert) the theory in the paper seems sound. Further the paper is well written and relatively easy to follow. However I do not find the experimental section completely comprehensive and some of the results seem to achieve worse performance than what is reported in the litterature for both the proposed method and baselines (see detailed questions below). Overall I currently score the paper as a weak reject although I can be convinced to bump the score depending on the author feedback.\n\nDetailed Questions:\nExperimental Results:\nQ1) In [Tieleman2008] log-likelihood values for the full MNIST dataset using a) a small model (25 hidden units) where the likelihood is computed exactly and b) an bigger model (500 hidden units) where the likelihood is approximated. On the full MNIST dataset they train using PCD, CD-1, CD-10 and report approximately Log-Likelihoods of -130 and -85 for the small and large models respectively. My questions are:\nQ1.1) In figure 4 you report approximate log-likelihood values on MNIST (only digits zero) of -150 for the different samplers using an RBM with100 hidden units. That seems to be lower performance than the models in [Tieleman2008] while training on a presumably easier dataset?\n\nQ1.2) In figure 4. Can you comment a bit on the variance of your method which seems to be higher, Is there a Bias/Variance trade-off between UCD and e.g PCD?\n\nQ1.3) [Tieleman2008] Reports training times of 1 to 9 Hours for training in on the full MNIST dataset in 2008 and [Hinton 2006] trained large RBMs in 2006. Why is that setting then computationally time-consuming today in your setup - Is there some difference in the setup that I'm missing? \n\nQ1.4) I highly value enlightening small scale experiments and do understand that computational resources are not available everywhere however I think it would benefit the paper greatly if the proposed method is demonstrated on some reasonably sized dataset (at the very least one of full MNIST, Fashion MNIST, FreyFaces).\n\nQ1.5) In Figure 2 you show some interesting figures for the average stopping time and number of rejected samples on the BAS toy dataset.

We have also included many other discussions such as the variance of UCD and the computational cost. The detailed responses are as follows.\n\n>>> Q1) In [Tieleman2008] log-likelihood values for the full MNIST dataset using a) a small model (25 hidden units) where the likelihood is computed exactly and b) an bigger model (500 hidden units) where the likelihood is approximated.

Why is that setting then computationally time-consuming today in your setup - Is there some difference in the setup that I'm missing? \n\nWhat we meant about \"time-consuming\" is the following: we found that the MNIST data set was quite \"benign\", or \"robust\", in the sense that even biased algorithms such as CD can train a reasonably good model. Therefore, it may take a very long time to actually observe the divergence of CD (recall that even in the small BAS data, it takes thousands of iterations). But on the Fashion-MNIST data that we use in the updated manuscript, it is easy to see the differences of CD, PCD, and UCD, even with a small number of iterations.\n\n>>> Q1.4) I highly value enlightening small scale experiments and do understand that computational resources are not available everywhere however I think it would benefit the paper greatly if the proposed method is demonstrated on some reasonably sized dataset (at the very least one of full MNIST, Fashion MNIST, FreyFaces).\n\nThanks for the recommendation.

We have included many new numerical results in the updated manuscript, and below are our line-to-line responses.\n\n>>> 1. I don\u2019t think Corollary 1 (convergence of gradient descent to the global optimum) is true for RBMs, as stated on Page 6. This is because the log-likelihood of RBM, or indeed any latent-variable model with permutation-invariant latents, is non-convex. I would suggest removing this corollary and simplifying Algorithm 2 to be regular SGD, as used in the experiments.\n\nFor Theorem 1 and Algorithm 2 we do not assume a specific model for $p(v,h)$, and Corollary 1 is mainly used to demonstrate a typical convergence result for SGD. Indeed it does not apply to RBM as the objective function is not convex, so on top of page 6 we have mentioned that there are other versions of the theorem, for different types of objective functions. We have made this clearer in the updated manuscript.\n\n>>> 2. There is no experimental comparison of Algorithm 1 (the general version) and Algorithm 3 (the specialized RBM version). It seems intuitive that the specialized version should have lower computation time, but this must be confirmed.\n\nThanks for pointing out. We have added this comparison in Appendix A.2.\n\n>>> 3. The experimental section may be significantly improved.\n>>> * It is unclear what value of k (number of initial Gibbs steps) from Algorithm 2 is used.\n\nIn all our experiments we set k=1. We have added this point to the text.\n\n>>> * The experiments on just the \u201c0\u201d digits of MNIST seem a bit simplistic for the year 2019. It is also not clear what binarization protocol is used.\n\nWe have significantly increased the size of the experiment: a full Fashion-MNIST data set with n=1000 hidden units. We treat data values as probabilities and globally binarize all the data points by sampling from Bernoulli distributions. The binarized data are then passed to the models.\n\n>>> * It would be very helpful to provide estimates of the gradient (not log-likelihood) variance of each method to better understand the trade-off between the bias and the variance.\n\nWe have included such an analysis in Appendix C.\n\n>>> * I would also like to see the wall-clock time comparison of the methods.\n\nWe have included the timing comparisons in Appendix B.\n\n>>> Minor comments\n>>> * Page 1.

The key issue in training such models is computing the gradient of the log partition function, which can be framed as computing the expected value of f(x) = dE(x; theta) / d theta over the model distribution p(x). The canonical algorithm for this problem is Contrastive Divergence which approximates x ~ p(x) with k steps of Gibbs sampling, resulting in biased gradients. In this paper, the authors apply the recently introduced unbiased MCMC framework of Jacob et al. to completely remove the bias. The key idea is to (1) rewrite the expectation as a limit of a telescopic sum: E f(x_0) + \\sum_t E f(x_t) - E f(x_{t-1}); (2) run two coupled MCMC chains, one for the \u201cpositive\u201d part of the telescopic sum and one for the \u201cnegative\u201d part until they converge. After convergence, all remaining terms of the sum are zero and we can stop iterating. However, the number of time steps until convergence is now random.\n\nOther contributions of the paper are:\n1. Proof that Bernoulli RBMs and other models satisfying certain conditions have finite expected number of steps and finite variance of the unbiased gradient estimator.\n2. A shared random variables method for the coupled Gibbs chains that should result in faster convergence of the chains.\n3. Verification of the proposed method on two synthetic datasets and a subset of MNIST, demonstrating more stable training compared to contrastive divergence and persistent contrastive divergence.\n\nI am very excited about this paper and strongly support its acceptance, since the proposed method should revitalize research in energy-based models. While I find the experiments to be somewhat lacking, this is sufficiently offset by the theoretical contributions of the paper.\n\nPros\n1. The paper reads well and introduces all the necessary preliminaries to understand the method. This is important, since I expect many readers to be unfamiliar with the technique.\n2. The proposed method solves an important problem which, as far as I understand, has been the roadblock in large-scale training of RBMs and related models. It is also elegant and fairly straightforward to implement.\n3. The proof of finite computation time and variance is very nice to have. This is because in some cases removing the bias leads to infinite variance, e.g. a parallel submission on SUMO (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SylkYeHtwr).\n\nCons\n1. I don\u2019t think Corollary 1 (convergence of gradient descent to the global optimum) is true for RBMs, as stated on Page 6.

The improvement upon the standard CD and persistent CD is clear.\nIt also appears that the algorithm actually does not require too many steps and generally does not introduce a lot of computational overhead. \nThe only question I have is why CD has only been tried with k=1 steps? \nI would be interested in its performance for different number of steps including the dynamically chosen number provided by the empirical \\tau in UCD for a given iteration.\nEven though I do not expect a significant improvement to be obtained, this would separate the effect of the number of steps chosen \u201cright\u201d from unbiasedness of the gradient estimator.\nOther baselines, including those mentioned in the related work, could also make the comparison more complete.\n\nI would also suggest including https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04062, as it seems to be relevant in the spirit."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2455/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2455/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["yixuanq@andrew.cmu.edu", "lingsong@purdue.edu", "wangxiao@purdue.edu"], "title": "Unbiased Contrastive Divergence Algorithm for Training Energy-Based Latent Variable Models", "authors": ["Yixuan Qiu", "Lingsong Zhang", "Xiao Wang"], "pdf": "/pdf/657b4d2249efb2827fbf6ee8082a4a104e9f0c8c.pdf", "TL;DR": "We have developed a new training algorithm for energy-based latent variable models that completely removes the bias of contrastive divergence.", "abstract": "The contrastive divergence algorithm is a popular approach to training energy-based latent variable models, which has been widely used in many machine learning models such as the restricted Boltzmann machines and deep belief nets.
