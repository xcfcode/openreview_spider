The objective is to learn embedding such that features corresponding to the same 3d location will have similar embeddings, while different - far away. Such embedding distance matrix is called \"feature universe\" in the paper. \nInstead of ground truth correspondence matrix, authors use smth called \"noisy adjacency matrix\", although it was not clear to me, what does it mean precisely. Loss is also augmented with epipolar distance reprojection error. \nTraining and testing is performed on Rome16k dataset. \n\nOverall I find paper hard to follow and weak on experiment side. Comments and questions:\n\n 1) There is no proper (or any) traditional baseline, which is: match SIFT features, apply cross-consistency and SNN ratio thresholds, run RANSAC, throw away all the inconsistent things. See COLMAP, Bundler or any other Visual SfM/MVS pipeline. Moreover, Hartman et.al. method is cited, but not compared to, because it needs \"3d reconstruction\" for supervision. Here is my second objection. \n \n 2) Paper states that the method is unsupervised. Yet, it is based on known scene geometry (R and t) , which is typically obtained via 3d reconstruction pipeline. Once you do it,  you actually have ground truth correspondences, a lot of them. I don`t understand, why not use them. \n \n 3) Experimental validation is also weird. Method was trained on Rome16k and tested on it as well. No other datasets were used besides Graffity sequence (see below). The metric is L1 norm on adjecency matrix instead of some.\n \n 4) Regarding \"feature universe\". It is clear, that one cannot fit (or can?) the full n_features x n_3d_points matrix into GPU memory, as it should be super huge matrix. No details were given on how such problems are tackled.  \n\n 5) The paper, unfortunately, has a number of side claims, which are false and actually irrelevant to the paper core. Just to list a few: \"deep learning has revolutionized how image features are computed (Yi et al., 2016).\" It has not. SIFT is still quite the gold standard:  (To Learn or Not to Learn: Visual Localization from Essential Matrices, https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01293, https://image-matching-workshop.github.io), besides that cited LIFT method was not used in practice because of being super slow.\n - \"More fundamentally, deep neural networks need large amounts of labeled data to train. In the case of multi-image feature matching, one would need hand-labeled point correspondences between images, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain.\".\n  Nobody hand-labels correspondences. Instead, one uses runs 3d reconstruction pipeline with densification like COLMAP to obtain dense depth map, what where one can get multiview correspondences (e.g., MegaDepth: Learning Single-View Depth Prediction from Internet Photos https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00607) \n  - \"Typically putative correspondences are matched probabilistically, meaning a feature in one image matches to many features\nin another. The ambiguity in the matches could come from repeated structures in the scene, insuffi-\nciently informative low-level feature descriptors, or just an error in the matching algorithm. Filtering\nout these noisy matches is our primary learning goal.\". Typically, one-to-many matches are just thrown away (e.g from Bundler SfM paper \"Modeling the World from Internet Photo Collections\", Sec.4.2: \"If a track contains more than one keypoint in the same image, it is deemed inconsistent.\nWe keep consistent tracks containing at least two keypoints for the next phase of the reconstruction procedure\").\n\n 6) Citations are sometimes weird. E.g. part of OxfordAffine dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/)  is referred as Graffity without any reference at all to the dataset itself (???), but with references to two irrelevant works which are testing on it. Why benchmark sycle consistency of such a small dataset of a flat surfaces? Then one could use Fountain sequence, at least, which has some non-planar structures on it. \n \n \n Minor Comments:\n \n  - Table 1 is hardly readable because of scientific notation used.\n\n\n****\nAfter rebuttal update.\n\nI am increasing my score a bit, but still think that paper is not is the shape for publishing. Method itself might be good, but evaluation is still bad, and what is worse - authors haven`t even tried to improve it.\n\n>At the end of the review period it will be revealed that we have 20 years of publication history in structure from motion and visual odometry.  \n\nThis, unfortunately, does not help the current paper.\n\n>We do in fact test on data not in our training set: we never trained on Graffiti. \nGraffity is still only 6 (six!!!) images, which are related by homography. One could show results, at least for HSequences (118 * 6) images or add other dataset. Since, it is not training, it could be done quite fast.\n\n> However, the focus of our paper is a novel feature representation, the formulation using a GNN framework, and the self-supervised losses. Overall, our paper is a novel approach to learning feature representations, a topic of great interest to the ICLR community, rather than a new structure from motion system that has to prove its superior performance over the current state of the art.\n\nI completely agree with it and would be happy to accept such paper to any kind of workshop.

Here, our goal is to demonstrate the potential of unsupervised learning representations in multi-image matching rather than achieve state-of-the-art performance.  It should be pointed out that in other computer vision problems learning methods initially underperformed those of their mature non-learning incumbents but were eventually surpassed, e.g., optical flow and depth estimation.  While utilizing GT correspondences can be helpful, we do not use them because having pairwise transformations is a more general assumption regarding datasets than having full 3D points and world-to-camera transformations.  For instance, R, T could be recovered from other sensing modalities (e.g., Lidar, radar, etc.) or from stereo calibration.  We use less measurements during training and empirically demonstrate this as an advantage of our approach.  Indeed, evaluating on the PhotoTourism dataset as well as comparing with classic pairwise outlier rejection are logical next steps. However, the focus of our paper is a novel feature representation, the formulation using a GNN framework, and the self-supervised losses. Overall, our paper is a novel approach to learning feature representations, a topic of great interest to the ICLR community, rather than a new structure from motion system that has to prove its superior performance over the current state of the art.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["stephi@seas.upenn.edu", "kostas@seas.upenn.edu"], "title": "Graph Neural Networks For Multi-Image Matching", "authors": ["Stephen Phillips", "Kostas Daniilidis"], "pdf": "/pdf/224abc04952b2a78f54dadbdf88e2096e16ccca2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We use Graph Neural Networks to learning multi-image feature matching with Geometric side losses.", "abstract": "In geometric computer vision applications, multi-image feature matching gives more accurate and robust solutions compared to simple two-image matching.

Our goal was not to provide a competitive representation for SfM/Bundle Adjustment. Reviewer 2 (WA) appreciates the novelty of the representation. The global sentiment is that the work is at early stages experimentally. We agree but we believe that ICLR is a stage for proposing novel learnt representations rather than competitive results on vision tasks like SfM. The beauty of representation research is that you cannot predict where exactly they will be useful. We believe that our framework uses the right language (graphs) for feature matching and by incorporating the reviewers\u2019 comments we will have also a much clearer presentation of the meaning of the embeddings and the corresponding losses.

Loss is also augmented with epipolar distance reprojection error.\u201c\n\nThe inter-image correspondence matrix, which we call the noisy adjacency matrix, is the adjacency matrix of the bi-partite graph of two view correspondences and it is called noisy because  we keep the top-5 nearest SIFT features as potential correspondences. These matrices and the epipolar geometries are the only input during training. The correspondence matrices are the only input during testing.\n\n1. Indeed, we did not compare with a baseline SfM pipeline because the purpose was to evaluate multi-view correspondences. Several other papers on multi-view matching (Pachauri et al., Zhu et al., Hu et al.) do not use SfM baselines for evaluation but only ground truth correspondences. We could have cleaned two-view matches with RANSAC but we wanted to show that we can learn representations that are resilient to outliers.\n\n2. Knowing inter-frame R,T does NOT give you ground-truth correspondences. It only constraints correspondences along epipolar lines. This is different than using transformations from world to camera which we do NOT use. Using R and T during training is a first step used by other keypoint learning papers, among  the most prominent see KeypointNet in Suwajanakorn, Snavely et al. NeurIPS 2018 (we will cite it).\n\n3. We have isolated parts of Rome16K for testing and Rome has definitely a higher variability in appearances than for example KITTI. Graffiti is the standard baseline test  for two-view and multi-view matching.\n\n4. This is true for all multi-view methods and that\u2019s why we use a sliding window with a varying set of images.\n\n5. We will retract our indeed not necessary claims. We fully agree with the reviewer  that SfM has not benefited yet from learnt representations and we will cite the learn or not to learn paper (but note that the feature learning experiments in that paper refer only to image pairs). However, the main bottleneck in any SfM problem is the correspondence problem and we should continue doing research on representations and correspondence learning, last but not least ICLR is for this purpose, not to advance SfM. We will also eliminate the \u201chand-labeled\u201d sentence, we agree with the reviewer. We disagree with the reviewer that one-to-many correspondences should be thrown away. This is the current practitioners\u2019 state of the art and should be so but from the perception point of view we should be able to build a system that can disambiguate them through multiple view consistency.\n\n6. We just used Graffiti because it is used in the other cycle consistency papers so that we can compare results. We will correct the citations.\n\n7. We will improve the readability of all tables.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["stephi@seas.upenn.edu", "kostas@seas.upenn.edu"], "title": "Graph Neural Networks For Multi-Image Matching", "authors": ["Stephen Phillips", "Kostas Daniilidis"], "pdf": "/pdf/224abc04952b2a78f54dadbdf88e2096e16ccca2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We use Graph Neural Networks to learning multi-image feature matching with Geometric side losses.", "abstract": "In geometric computer vision applications, multi-image feature matching gives more accurate and robust solutions compared to simple two-image matching.

Huang and L. Guibas (Consistent shape maps via semide\ufb01nite programming, 2013) and was shown to be equivalent to the \u201cliteral\u201d cycle consistency of (eq. 3). There is a parallel to geometric transformations: Eq. 3 expresses the composition of relative poses (like local coordinate systems) which is equivalent to estimating the global pose of every coordinate system to an absolute coordinate system (universe). A row in X represents a soft assignment of universe features for an image feature in image i (or a matching probability vector), so the inner product between a row x_i and a row x_j is a soft matching value. It indeed involves a real cycle because of the sufficiency condition of (3) for (4) shown in Huang and Guibas (Consistent Shape Maps via Semide\ufb01nite Programming). \n\n(2) We actually do not use any hard assignments for initial matches. We use the K best matches and use the cos-distance of SIFT features. So this includes many one-to-many ambiguous matches and we could definitely vary the K to see its effect on the final representation (we have a variation of noise in synthetic data experiments in Table 1). \nIndeed, and we are honest about this in the conclusion that our results are comparable to optimization methods. However, we believe that ICLR rewards novelty of representations and that the proposed work is novel and different than traditional image feature embeddings. \n\n(3) We will cite the four references. Swoboda\u2019s convex approach,  Shi\u2019s Tensor Power Iteration, and Yan\u2019s Affinity optimization are all directly relevant to the baselines we compared and we will definitely add them to the literature as well as the Flowweb which establishes dense correspondences and keypoints are a side-product of pooling. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["stephi@seas.upenn.edu", "kostas@seas.upenn.edu"], "title": "Graph Neural Networks For Multi-Image Matching", "authors": ["Stephen Phillips", "Kostas Daniilidis"], "pdf": "/pdf/224abc04952b2a78f54dadbdf88e2096e16ccca2.pdf", "TL;DR": "We use Graph Neural Networks to learning multi-image feature matching with Geometric side losses.", "abstract": "In geometric computer vision applications, multi-image feature matching gives more accurate and robust solutions compared to simple two-image matching.

The authors use vertex embeddings to exploit cycle consistency constraints in an efficient manner, then the GNN is used to learn the appropriate embeddings in an unsupervised fashion. The geometric consistency loss is used to aid training in addition. Experimental evaluation shows its performance compared to MatchALS (Zhou et al., 2015) and PGDDS (Leonardos et al., 2016). \n\nI think this paper has some potential but has not matured yet. My main concerns are as follows. \n\n1) Cyclic consistency terms\nThe way of learning vertex embeddings using cycle consistency in an unsupervised manner is interesting, but I'm not sure whether we should call it real cycle consistency. The authors assume a cycle going from a vertex to its embeddings, coming back to the vertex. Given two vertices, it has the form of Eq. (4), which is called cycle consistency constraints in this paper. But, it's in effect nothing but the dot product similarity between two vertex embeddings. I agree that this can be interpreted as a type of cycle constraint, but does not involve any real cycle at the end. This needs to be justified. \n\n2) Unsupervised learning\nThe proposed, so-called, cycle constraint terms are learned using noisy adjacency matrix (as pseudo labels) from initial matches. This would be sensitive to the quality of the inial matches, so needs to be analyzed by experiments, which are not done. And, the effect of geometric consistency term is not clear at all in the experiments. Does it help? then how much? Some ablation studies are required. \n\n3) Experimental comparison\nWhile there exist many related papers on multi-image matching, the authors compared only to two methods, and the performance gain is not significant. The overall results are not convincing.
