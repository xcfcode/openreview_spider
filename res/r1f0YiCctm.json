However, we want to point out that Harsha et al. (2010) presented their work in a very different setting, i.e. a general bound on communication complexity. They provide a mathematical proof for the bound, which, however, does not translate to a feasible algorithm. We, on the other hand, propose a novel algorithm that achieves the bound on the encoding length and we provide performance guarantees using results from Chatterjee & Diaconis (2018) -- their results also do not directly translate to our setting (we consider an approximate sampling algorithm while they discuss the sample size required for importance sampling). As far as we know, neither of these works have received considerable attention in the machine learning literature.\n\nIn terms of baselines, our main goal was to compare against Bayesian compression, a state-of-the-art algorithm that is also motivated by the bits-back argument. We included further state-of-the-art baselines where they were available (VGG16/CIFAR10 was only reported in the Bayesian compression paper). We omitted compression algorithms that focus on improving the efficiency at runtime since these typically have significantly worse performance in terms of compression.

We hope that this reply addresses some of the concerns.\n\nIndeed, the paper has two key contributions. Firstly, the theoretical results that show that MIRACLE is a generalization of the Shannon-type coding schemes and secondly, the implementation of the algorithm that achieve state-of-the-art results on the two benchmark tasks.\n\nReviewer 2 points out that, while the basic algorithm encodes random samples, this is not the case for MIRACLE since it fixes the weights in each block and does further training on the rest. We argue that they are still random samples because by retraining after fixing each block, we are no longer sampling from a mean-field Gaussian, we are effectively sampling from a more flexible, autoregressive distribution (since each dimension is dependent on the previous ones). Indeed, if the retraining step was omitted, then we would be sampling from a less flexible, mean-field Gaussian distribution which leads to worse performance.\n\nRegarding the point that the origin of the gain is unclear, we can provide rough estimates. The difference in compression size between a mean-field Gaussian (without retraining) and the flexible distribution with retraining is about 2 times. The use of the hashing trick gives an improvement of about 1.5 times.\n\nThe size of the encoding of the standard deviation of the prior is trivial compared to the overall compression size. They take 32x(number of layers) bits in the final message. For LeNet-5, this is approximately 1.0 % of the overall compression size and for VGG-16, it is approximately 0.05 % of the overall compression size.\n\nUsing different distributions is an interesting avenue to explore. We believe, for example, that sparsity inducing priors could be beneficial. In this version of the paper, we settled with Gaussians because the reparameterization trick straight forwardly applies and the KL divergence has a closed form.\n\nRegarding the approximation error of algorithm 1, we have not done extensive experiments to quantify it. In our experience, exp(KL) samples perform well enough. Following the suggestion in the review, we ran an experiment on a toy example to see how the approximation error changes with the number of samples. It show that the total variation tends to 0 as the number of samples K increases, but it is still difficult to quantify how K affects the overall performance.

It can also be directly used to sample from continuous distributions, while Shannon-type algorithms require quantization. In my opinion, this is the main contribution of the paper.\n\nThe other part of the paper that is specifically concerned with weight compression (\"MIRACLE\") turns out to be a lot less elegant. It is somewhat ironic that the authors specifically call attention to the their algorithm sending random samples, as opposed to existing algorithms, which quantize and then send deterministic variables. This is clearly true for the basic algorithm, but, if I understand correctly, not for MIRACLE. It seems clear that neural networks are sensitive to random resampling of their weights -- otherwise, the authors would not have to fix the weights in each block and then do further gradient descent for the following blocks. What would happen if the distributions were held constant, and the algorithm would be run again, just with a different (but identical) random seed in both sender and receiver? It seems this would lead to a performance drop, demonstrating that (albeit indirectly), MIRACLE also makes a deterministic choice of weights.\n\nOverall, I find the paper somewhat lacking in terms of evaluation. MIRACLE consists of a lot of parts. It is hard to assess how much of the final coding gain presented in table 1 is due to the basic algorithm. What is the effect of selecting other probability models, possibly different ones than Gaussians? Choosing appropriate distributions can have a significant impact on the value of the KL divergence. Exactly how much is gained by applying the hashing trick? Are the standard deviations of the priors included in the size, and how are they encoded?\n\nThis could be assessed more clearly by directly evaluating the basic algorithm. Theorem 3.2 predicts that the approximation error of algorithm 1 asymptotically zero, i.e. one can gain an arbitrarily good approximation to the posterior by spending more bits. But how many more are practically necessary? It would be fantastic to actually see some empirical data quantifying how large the error is for different distributions (even simple toy distributions).

It seems that your method makes quantization unnecessary. It's known that in the standard bits back method, weights can be communicated at arbitrarily high precision without affecting the communication cost (see e.g. [1] p. 353). The theory in [2] which you apply also seems to hold for continuous random variables. Moreover you don't do seem to do quantization in your experiments (I may be missing something since I don't know TensorFlow well), so I assume you are already aware of this fact.\n\nI'm wondering if it might be worth mentioning in your paper, perhaps in the related work section, that quantization is effectively optional with your method.

Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance.", "keywords": ["compression", "neural networks", "bits-back argument", "Bayesian", "Shannon", "information theory"], "authorids": ["mh740@cam.ac.uk", "rp587@cam.ac.uk", "jmh233@cam.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Marton Havasi", "Robert Peharz", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato"], "TL;DR": "This paper proposes an effective method to compress neural networks based on recent results in information theory.", "pdf": "/pdf/44c2f8b0aa023cdfa824e9d917e51fb348205bb3.pdf", "paperhash": "havasi|minimal_random_code_learning_getting_bits_back_from_compressed_model_parameters", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nhavasi2018minimal,\ntitle={Minimal Random Code Learning: Getting Bits Back from Compressed Model Parameters},\nauthor={Marton Havasi and Robert Peharz and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1f0YiCctm},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper493/Public_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1542311827468, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed."}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "forum": "r1f0YiCctm", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper493/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper493/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper493/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "replyto": null, "content": {"comment": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters)."}, "title": {"value-regex": ".{1,500}", "required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment."}}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["~"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper493/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper493/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper493/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1542311827468}}}], "count": 13}
