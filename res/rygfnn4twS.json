Different from previous methods focusing on network-level or layer-lever quantization, this work pays attention to kernel-level quantization. Specifically, they use a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to search in the search space related with quantization. The experiment result validates the significance of the work.\n\nStrength\nThe paper provides us with a new insight into network quantization. Even though the extension from layer-level to kernel-level is straightforward, the improvement is significant and meaningful. The experiment result demonstrates its efficiency in real applications.\n\nWeakness\n1. The algorithm of the paper is similar with previous work HAQ, which is based on DRL to guide the search procedure. Thus, the novelty of algorithm is somewhat weak.\n \n2. For kernel-level quantization, this paper proposes a hierarchical DRL method. However, I didn't see the importance of the hierarchy. The author may discusses more about this and compare it with flatten algorithms for ablation study. \n\n3. The paper didn't compare their methods with other baselines on the same level. I think some algorithms can be applied into kernel-level quantization directly. Based on the same level comparison, the efficiency of your method can be seen more directly. \n\n4. The description was not written well. For example, the detail of the experiment and the hardware settings are unclear.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper181/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper181/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AutoQ: Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization ", "authors": ["Qian Lou", "Feng Guo", "Minje Kim", "Lantao Liu", "Lei Jiang."], "authorids": ["louqian@iu.edu", "fengguo@iu.edu", "minje@indiana.edu", "lantao@iu.edu", "jiang60@iu.edu"], "keywords": ["AutoML", "Kernel-Wise Neural Networks Quantization", "Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Accurate, Fast and Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization with Mixed Precision using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Network quantization is one of the most hardware friendly techniques to enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power mobile devices.

The algorithm uses a reward function that weights accuracy of the quantized model with latency, energy, and FPGA area, and leverages a high level and low-level controller to create quantized models that can take into account these factors. Compared to prior approaches taht only perform layer-wise instead of kernel-wise quantization, the quantized models can achieve better performance, or latency.\n\nWhile the problem of more effectively quantizing neural network weights and activations is interesting, I found this paper hard to follow and evaluate. The proposed hierarchical deep RL method mentions a number of tricks and design decisions that are not ablated, and the notation and text around the method were difficult to follow. There were also no baselines comparing to other approaches for performing kernel-wise quantization (e.g. random search, quantize based off variance, etc.). Without improved baselines and text I would recommend rejecting this paper.\n\nMajor comments:\n* Based on the analysis of kernel-wise results, it seems that a very simple strategy that chooses QBNs based on weight variance could be sufficient to achieve good performance. However, there\u2019s no comparisons to these kinds of heuristics or even to random search over QBN per-kernel. There are also no ablations that study whether the hierarchical-RL based approach beats a baseline that just directly predicts the kernel-wise QBNs independently.  Without these baselines, it\u2019s hard to know how well AutoQ works.\n* The text that details the hierarchical RL approach with multiple controllers that is core to the new AutoQ approach is extremely hard to follow, with many undefined symbols.\n\nMinor comments:\n* FIg 1: where in the neightwork do these weight kernels come from? What network/dataset?\n* You repeatedly state that ML experts obtain only sub-optimal results at selecting QBNs, can you cite something for this? What if you give experts access to additiional information like visualizations of weight distributions?\n* What\u2019s the tradeoff between using different QBNs for each kernel and specifying this number? Is there additional memory overhead?\n* Table 1: hard to read the exponent in kernel-wise math, add parentheses\n* Please use \\citep vs. \\citet where appropriate\n* Why not also search for kernel-specific activation quantization? \n* The notation in Fig 3 and surrounding text is really hard to follow, e.g. w_w, h_w, and indices into states (roundup could be ceil, names are confusing iRd, eRd?).\n* Eqn 2 comes out of nowhere\u2026 why optimize for log(accuracy) vs accuracy? How do you choose the user-defined constants? Decay factor?\n* Hardware overhead estimator: are these models accurate independent of QBN?\n* Why do you have to perform Gaussian augmentation? I didn\u2019t follow the re-labeling of transitions after Eqn. 6, is this needed?\n* Define \\mu when you first use it (Eqn 4?)\n* Is \\delta_a in implementation details the same as \\sigma around Eqn 4?\n* Table 3: Is there variance in these results based off fine-tuning? Could you include error bars or stderr on these estimates?\n* Figure 6: are the search spaces different for these different approaches? I.e. does AutoQ perform better due to the upper/lower bounds you set on QBN?\n\n=============\n\nThank you to the authors for addressing many of my concerns. The updated paper still does not present any baselines for methods that can search or learn kernel-wise quantization parameters, e.g. run random search and select the best-performing models according to your reward function.

Importantly, due to a large amount of search space, hierarchical RL was used to guide the search.\n\nStrength\n\nFirst of all, I really liked the idea about more detailed search for kernel-wise configurations. It is interesting to see that different kernel settings has different best bitwidth. More importantly, it is great to provide cost model based estimations for cost/latency.\n\nThe authors also provided detailed discussion about weight bit distributions and average quantization bits among the layers. \n\nThe author provided implementation on real world FPGAs using bit-serial spatial architecture, which plays particularly nice with the algorithm. This something that should be highlighted in the discussion.\n\nWeakness\n\nFirst of all, I would love to see more detailed discussion about the corresponding hardware support implications. In particular, given the need of re-using computing resources, kernel-wise quantization has to use the bit-serial version of architecture(otherwise the MAC cannot be reused and we have to layout the entire network on FPGA), which may limit the applicability of the methods to higher number of bits.\n\nThe second potential weakness is the close relation between the method and HAQ. The method feels like a straight-forward extension(with DRL added). What would happen if you directly apply HAQ\u2019s method to the kernel-wise search space?\n\nFinally it would be great if the authors can clarify more about the FPGA setups(number of accumulators being used, whether there is reuse of compute unit in FPGA, or did you just layout everything spatially).\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow do you handle layers like BatchNorm(which normally need floating pt)?\n\nOverall, I find this paper provides interesting insights and solid evaluation and should be accepted to ICLR.\n\n\n---\ni have read the authors' response. \n\nPlease do note that because the different kernel-wise precision, the accelerator has to resort to bit-serial computation, which somewhat limits the structure of the accelerator. e.g. we cannot simply build 8bit MAC along with 4 bit ones, but have to use 4bit ones to bit-serially accumulate the 8 bit ones. This will somewhat limit the applicability of the model, and i think the author should add a discussion section to the paper about this limitation.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper181/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper181/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AutoQ: Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization ", "authors": ["Qian Lou", "Feng Guo", "Minje Kim", "Lantao Liu", "Lei Jiang."], "authorids": ["louqian@iu.edu", "fengguo@iu.edu", "minje@indiana.edu", "lantao@iu.edu", "jiang60@iu.edu"], "keywords": ["AutoML", "Kernel-Wise Neural Networks Quantization", "Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Accurate, Fast and Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization with Mixed Precision using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Network quantization is one of the most hardware friendly techniques to enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power mobile devices.

Comparing against choosing QBNs based on weight variance\n \nFirst, simple heuristics like choosing QBNs based on weight variances cannot compete with our AutoQ, because of Equation 2, the Extrinsic Reward of AutoQ. AutoQ can not only do kernel-wise quantization but also directly consider the inference latency, hardware overhead and inference energy during the searches for QBNs. For example, in Table 3, we can see that different search policies such as resource-constrained and accuracy-guaranteed searches find totally different results. Although for ResNet-18, two search policies achieve only 2.4\\% top-1 accuracy difference and 0.18\\% top-5 accuracy difference, the inference latency difference is huge, i.e., >128\\%. The simple heuristics cannot distinguish the latency, energy and hardware overhead difference at all.\n\nSecond, although it is reasonable to choose a larger QBN (+A-bit) to quantize a weight kernel with larger variance (+B\\%), it is difficult to decide how large QBN should be assigned to the kernel, i.e., the quantitative ratio between A and B. We tried such simple heuristic by setting a fixed ratio between A and B (e.g., 1:1 or 1:10), but the kernel-wise quantization result, i.e., accuracy, is much worse than HAQ [Wang et al. (2019)] and ReLeQ [Elthakeb et al. (2018)]. This is why we did not show such simple and na\u00efve heuristics in the paper. If Reviewer-1 knows some papers show such simple heuristics can work, we are happy to read those references and add them as our strong baselines. \n\n\n2. Fig 1: weight kernels? network/dataset?\n\nThe weight kernels are from ResNet-18 on ImageNet. \n\n\n3. Reference of ML experts obtaining only sub-optimal results?\n\n[Wang et al. (2019)] shows sometimes ML experts obtain only sub-optimal results during designing QBNs. ML experts are rare resources. AutoQ can automatically perform kernel-wise quantization for average users.\n\n\n4. Extra memory overhead?\n\nWe described the Storage Cost at the end of Section 3.\n\n\n5. Kernel-specific activation quantization?\n\nEach activation layer of a CNN is defined as $\\mathbf{A}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{layer}\\times c_{in}\\times w_{a}\\times h_{a}}$, where $n_{layer}$ is the number of layers; $c_{in}$ is the input channel number, $w_{a}$ is the feature map width, and $h_{a}$ means the feature map height. An activation layer has no kernel domain.\n\n\n6. The notation in Fig 3.\n\nThe notations in Figure 3 are consistent with the notations in Equation 1 \u2013 6. $w_{w}$ indicates the weight kernel width, and $h_{w}$ is the weight kernel height. iRd is the Intrinsic Reward, while eRd is the extrinsic Reward.\n\n\n7. In Eqn 2, log(accuracy) vs accuracy? \n\nEquation 2 is the most important equation in this paper. We define it as the Extrinsic Reward. Compared to directly using accuracy, log(accuracy) can make the HLC and LLC more sensitive to the accuracy degradation, so that they can find the QBN configurations with higher inference accuracy. User-defined constants are NOT decay factors. They are factor weights. Some design trade-offs can be decided by only users. For instance, AutoQ cannot decide the power consumption reduction is more important or the chip area reduction is more important for users. Only user themselves can decide which one is more important by assigning a larger weight to it. \n\n\n8. Hardware overhead estimator accurate independent of QBN?\n\nYes, the hardware overhead [Liu & Carloni (2013)] and power [Zhou et al. (2019)] estimators are trained by synthesis result mappings between QBN, hardware overhead and power consumption. It can accurately predict the hardware overhead and power consumption for each input QBN configuration.\n\n\n9. Gaussian augmentation? Re-labeling transitions after Eqn. 6?\n\nAutoQ needs to perform the re-labeling. Because the LLC is learning and thus changing. The state-goal-reward transitions stored in the replay buffer are not 100% correct. These transitions obtained from the past LLCs do not accurately reflect the actions that would occur if the same goal was used with the current LLC.\n\n\n10. $\\mu$ in Eqn 4?\n\n$\\mu_{\\phi_{LLC}}^{LLC}(state_{[L_{i}, K_{j+1}]}$ is the policy network of LLC.\n\n\n11. Is $\\delta_a$ the same as $\\sigma$ around Eqn 4?\n\nNo, $\\delta_{a_{[L_i,K_j]}}=0.5$ in the implementation details is the probability of LLC to perform explorations on its action during the search. In contrast, $\\sigma_{a_{[L_i,K_j]}}$ in Equation 4 is the variance of the action during the exploitation.\n\n\n12. Table 3: Variance in results?\n\nError bars will be in the next version.\n\n\n13. Figure 6: are search spaces different for different approaches? \n\nIn Figure 6, all techniques use the same quantization method LQ-Nets and the same upper/lower bounds on the QBN during the search for MobileNetV2 on ImageNet. AutoQ outperforms because of its Hierarchical DRL agents with shaped intrinsic reward.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper181/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper181/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AutoQ: Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization ", "authors": ["Qian Lou", "Feng Guo", "Minje Kim", "Lantao Liu", "Lei Jiang."], "authorids": ["louqian@iu.edu", "fengguo@iu.edu", "minje@indiana.edu", "lantao@iu.edu", "jiang60@iu.edu"], "keywords": ["AutoML", "Kernel-Wise Neural Networks Quantization", "Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Accurate, Fast and Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization with Mixed Precision using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Network quantization is one of the most hardware friendly techniques to enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power mobile devices.

The motivation of using hierarchical DRL.\n\nCompared to the layer-wise quantization technique like HAQ, the search space of our kernel-wise quantization AutoQ is much larger as Table 1 shows. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional DRL DDPG-based agents to find optimal results for our kernel-wise quantization AutoQ. In Figure 6, compared to a DRL DDPG-based agent (HAQ), our hierarchical DRL with shaped intrinsic reward (AutoQ) uses shorter search latency to find a kernel-wise quantized CNN configuration with much higher inference accuracy.\n\n\n2. The definition of $iRd_{[L_i, K_j]}$ in the Intrinsic Reward.\n\n$iRd_{[L_i, K_j]}$ is the intrinsic reward for the weight kernel $K_j$ of the layer $L_i$. And it is used to evaluate the LLC action for the weight kernel $K_j$ of the layer $L_i$.\n\n\n3. HAQ uses simple quantization. Why did we use LQ-Nets? Is it fair?\n\nTo present the state-of-the-art inference accuracy, in this paper, we make both HAQ and AutoQ quantize CNNs by LQ-Nets in all figures and tables. It is a fair comparison.

More details on hardware support. The kernel-wise quantization has to use the bit-serial architecture, which may limit the applicability of the methods to higher number of bits.\n\nThe kernel-wise quantization uses bit-serial multiply-accumulation (MAC) units in both the temporal [Umuroglu et al. (2019b)] and the spatial [Sharma et al. (2018)] CNN accelerators. In each cycle, a bit-serial MAC unit can compute only 1-bit of a fixed-point MAC operation. For instance, if we quantize a kernel with 4-bit, a bit-serial MAC unit requires 4 cycles to complete a 4-bit MAC operation. However, compared to the conventional N-bit-parallel MAC unit, a bit-serial MAC unit costs only <1/N hardware overhead and <1/N power consumption. The CNN inference latency is decided by the accelerator MAC throughput. Although a bit-serial MAC unit increases the latency of an N-bit MAC operation by N times, both the temporal and the spatial CNN accelerators implement N times bit-serial MAC units to maintain the same MAC throughput with even smaller hardware overhead and power consumption. For higher number of bits, these bit-serial architectures can still have the same MAC throughput. Our kernel-wise quantization greatly reduces the average quantization bit number (QBN) of a CNN. Therefore, it can significantly increase the inference throughput of CNNs on both the temporal and the spatial CNN accelerators.\n\n\n2. Directly applying HAQ\u2019s method to the kernel-wise search space?\n\nCompared to the layer-wise quantization technique like HAQ, the search space of our kernel-wise quantization AutoQ is much larger as Table 1 shows. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional DRL DDPG-based agents to find optimal results for our kernel-wise quantization AutoQ. In Figure 6, compared to a DRL DDPG-based agent (HAQ), our hierarchical DRL with shaped intrinsic reward (AutoQ) uses shorter search latency to find a kernel-wise quantized CNN configuration with much higher inference accuracy.\n\n\n3. Clarify the FPGA setups.\n\nThe detailed implementation and configuration of the temporal accelerator is shown in [Umuroglu et al. (2019b)], while those of the spatial one can be found in [Sharma et al. (2018)]. The spatial CNN BitFunsion accelerator adopt a 2D systolic array of the fusion MAC units spatially summing the shifted partial products of weights and activations. The systolic array can automatically and spatially control and process the MAC data flow. We do not need to layout everything spatially.\n\n\n4.\tHow do you handle layers like Batch Norm (which normally need floating pt)?\n\nWe use fixed-point batch normalization during the kernel-wise quantized CNN inferences. Compared to its floating-point counterpart, the fixed-point batch normalization has little inference accuracy loss [Chen et al. (2017), Lin et al. (2016)].\n\n\nX. Chen, X. Hu, H. Zhou and N.
