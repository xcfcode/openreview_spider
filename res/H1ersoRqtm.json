The review below is the original one I wrote before the paper changes.\n\n# Positive aspects of this submission\n\n- The intuition and motivation behind the proposed model are well explained.\n\n- The empirical results on the MethodNaming and MethodDoc tasks are very promising.\n\n# Criticism\n\n- The novelty of the proposed model is limited since it is essentially adding an existing GGNN layer, introduced by Li et al. (2015), on top of an existing LSTM encoder. The most important novelty seems to be the custom graph representation for these sequence inputs to make them compatible with the GGNN, which should then deserve a more in-depth study (i.e. ablation study with different graph representations, etc).\n\n- Since you compare your model performance against Alon et al. on Java-small, it should be fair to report the numbers on Java-med and Java-large as well.\n\n- The \"GNN -> LSTM+POINTER\" experiment results are reported on the MethodDoc task, but not for MethodNaming. Reporting this number for MethodNaming is essential to show the claimed empirical superiority of the hybrid encoder compared to GNN only.\n\n- I have doubts about the usefulness of the proposed model for natural language summarization, for the following reasons:\n\n    - The comparison of the proposed model for NLSummarization against See et al. is a bit unfair, since it uses additional information through the CoreNLP named entity recognizer and coreference models. With the experiments listed in Table 1, there is no way to know whether the increased performance is due to the hybrid encoder design or due the additional named entity and coreference information. Adding the entity and coreference data in a simpler way (i.e. at the token embedding level with a basic sequence encoder) in the ablation study would very useful to answer that question.\n\n    - In NLSummarization, connecting sentence nodes using a NEXT edge can be analogous to using a hierarchical encoder, as used by Nallapati et al. (\"Abstractive Text Summarization using Sequence-to-sequence RNNs and Beyond\", 2016). Ignoring the other edges of the GNN graph, what are the theoretical and empirical advantages of your method compared to this sentence-level hierarchical encoder?\n\n    - Adding the coverage decoder introduced by See et al. to your model would have been very useful to prove that the current performance gap is indeed due to the simplistic decoder and not something else.\n\n- How essential is the weighted averaging for graph-level document representation (Gilmer et al. 2017) compared to uniform averaging?\n\n- A few minor comments about writing:\n    - In Table 1, please put the highest numbers in bold to improve readability\n    - On page 7, the word \"summaries\" is missing in \"the model produces natural-looking with no noticeable negative impact\"\n    - On page 9, \"cove content\" should be \"core content\"\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Neural Summarization", "abstract": "Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input.

Unfortunately, due to a problem with integrating the \u201ccoverage\u201d idea of See et al. into our codebase and the long training times for these models, we were unable to update the paper with these results so far. However, we expect to provide these results over the next few days. We note that the time since the start of the rebuttal period was too short to do hyperparameter optimization on the CNN/DailyMail summarization dataset, and we instead used the same hyperparameters we used before (without coverage).\n\nConcretely, we provide the following additional experimental results:\n\n\u2022\tWe have added the GNN->LSTM+pointer model for the Method Naming task as requested by Reviewer 3. The results show that removing the biLSTM encoder worsens the results compared to our biLSTM+GNN->LSTM+pointer network.\n\n\u2022\tWe ran biLSTM encoder-based baselines for the CNN/DM task using the OpenNMT implementation, to better compare with our extension of that codebase. Despite using the same setup as See et al. our experiments yield slightly worse results. This is most likely due to the fact that we have not performed separate hyperparameter optimization for each task but instead use identical hyperparameters for _all_ our tasks and datasets. Our biLSTM+GNN results are most fairly compared to these baselines.\n\n\u2022\tAs discussed in our last post, we have performed experiments 1-3 on CNN/DM to analyze the influence of the extra information provided by the CoreNLP parser. The results can be summarized as follows:\n\n      o\t[Experiment 1] We ran a biLSTM encoder with access to the CoreNLP parse information. Concretely, we extended the token embedding with an embedding of the per-token information provided by the parser, and additionally added tags marking references using fresh \u201c<REF1>\u201d, \u201c<REF2>\u201d, \u2026 tokens. Our results indicate that this only minimally improves results compared to the standard biLSTM encoder operating on words, and hence that exposing the structure explicitly by using a GNN encoder provides more advantages.\n\n      o\t[Experiment 2] Removing all linguistic structure, i.e. Stanford CoreNLP edges, but retaining the extra sentence nodes and edges, yields a small improvement over the baseline biLSTM-based encoder, increasing ROUGE-2 score by one point and yielding minor differences in the other metrics.\n\n      o\t[Experiment 3] When adding edges that connect tokens with identical stemmed string representations, the performance increases a bit but does not reach the performance levels comparable to using the full coreference resolution.\n\n\nWe have clarified the above points in the text. In conclusion, pending on the coverage experiment, the above experiments demonstrate that:\n\na)\tNeither biLSTM, nor GNN encoders alone achieve best performance in summarization tasks and the biLSTM+GNN combination improves on all baselines in all cases.\n\nb)\tEncoding additional linguistic structure is helpful for natural language summarization but cannot be captured adequately using only a standard biLSTM encoder.\n\nc)\tEncoding sentence and connecting long-distance tokens with the same stems only slightly helps performance, while using more advanced resolution of references yields bigger gains.\n\nFinally, we would like to emphasize again the broad applicability of our summarization method to both natural language and source code. While the natural language summarization task is clearly the most interesting for the reviewers, our summarization model is also able to compete with (and beat) specialized approaches on the two source code tasks on three datasets.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Neural Summarization", "abstract": "Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input.

Further analysis of this behavior traced this to a problem with a duplication of samples in the dataset. For example, about 30.7% of files in the Java-Large are near-duplicates of other files in the corpus (across all folds), indicating that results on these datasets primarily measure overfitting to the data. We managed to train competitive models, but only by choosing very large sizes for the hidden dimensions (>1000) and removing dropout. In contrast, Java-Small only has 3.0% duplicates. We will clarify this in the next version of our paper. [This is similar to our experiences with the Barone & Sennrich dataset discussed in Sect. 4.1.2.]\n\n\nOn NL Summarization and additional information:\n\nWe agree that our model uses additional information that is not available to the pure sequence models \u2013 indeed, we believe that the ability to use this information is the core contribution of our work. Indeed, it is unclear how to add information from the CoreNLP parser to a standard sequence model (how, for example, are coreference connections represented?). As discussed in our reply to all reviews, we will run additional experiments to further elucidate this effect. Primarily, we will run an LSTM baseline that uses additional per-token information in the embedding of words, and additionally will introduce fresh tokens (\u201c<REF1>\u201d, \u2026) to mark points at which references are made. If you had other comparisons in mind, please do react quickly, as these experiments do take a bit of time...\n\n\nOn comparison with Nallapati et al. 2016:\n\nThe structure of the \u201cNext\u201d tokens in the graph model resembles that of Nallapati et al. (2016). However, the core difference is in how message-passing GNNs work. In Nallapati et al. (2016) computing the representations this is truly hierarchical, I.e. information flows in one direction: sentence representations are computed, then these are combined into a document representation. In a GNN, messages are passed in both directions, and thus our per-sentence nodes also allow the exchange of information between different tokens in the same sentence. Hence, our model is more comparable to a hierarchical setting in which information can flow both up and down.\n\n\nOn using coverage:\n\nWe wanted to avoid the additional work for this experiment, since we believe that the improvements from adding a coverage mechanism are orthogonal to the ones provided by our model but will now run this and provide the results once the experiments have finished.\n\n\nOn weighted averaging:\n\nIn past experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks, we have found that weighted averaging helps compared to uniform averaging. We believe that this is due to the fact that weighted averaging acts as an attention-like mechanism that allows the model to pick the salient information from the graph while allowing the message-passing to \u201cfreely\u201d transfer information. Since this is also the accepted method in the GNN literature (e.g. Gilmer et al. 2017) we did not further experiment with this design decision. As our compute resources are limited, we want to avoid rerunning this ablation on the CNN/DM dataset, but will provide additional experiments on the two smaller tasks.  \n\n\nPlease, let us know if these do not sufficiently address the concerns you raise in your review and what alternative experiments are missing."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Neural Summarization", "abstract": "Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input.

As discussed in our reply to all reviews, we will run four additional experiments covering points raised by the different reviewers.\n\n\nOn related work in NLP with graphs:\n\nThank you for bringing up additional related work. The cited works handle quite different tasks, and so drawing a direct comparison to our work is hard. Marcheggiani et al. (2017) uses their model, with a single GCN propagation, for classification not sequence prediction, whereas Bastings et al. (2017) does sentence-to-sentence translation. Both employ purely syntactic graphs and thus lack the advantages that additional semantic information can provide. Our additional experiments 2 and 3 are designed to show the effect of this. The short paper of De Cao et al. (2018) uses a GCN over entities in multiple documents.  Finally, we want to highlight that we propose to use graphs for longer documents, whereas the approaches above are primarily concerned with single sentences. On average the CNN/DM documents lead to graphs with 900 nodes and 2.5k edges.\n\nRegarding the question of SequentialGNN vs GCN, we believe that there are no substantial differences between the use of GCNs and GGNNs. The core contribution proposed in our paper is the idea to fuse information obtained from state-of-the-art sequence models with a form of structured reasoning that can integrate domain knowledge.\nWe will clarify the above in the related work section.\n\n\nOn the performance of SelfAtt vs. SelfAtt+GNN on MethodDoc C#:\n\nIn the paper, we discuss this result explicitly in the third paragraph of 4.1.4. The core reason for the decrease in ROUGE scores is that the SelfAtt+GNN model produces substantially longer outputs, which tends to impact ROUGE scores. This causes the substantial improvement in the BLEU score. We will extend the appendix to include examples of outputs of the SelfAtt/SelfAtt+GNN models that illustrate how the longer output improves the information content of the results. Overall, we want to note that ROUGE and BLEU are problematic measures for these tasks, but we are not aware of any other metrics that can be computed at scale.\n\n\nOn randomness of shown samples:\n\nThe sample in Figure 2 is one appearing in See et al. For Figure 1, we had to pick a sample that would fit within the given space, so it\u2019s not randomly sampled. All other examples are randomly selected. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Neural Summarization", "abstract": "Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input.

The extension of GNNs is simple, but effective across all datasets in comparison to external baselines for CNN/DailyMail, internal baselines for C#, and a combination of both for Java. The idea of applying a more structured approach to summarization is well motivated given that current summarization methods tend to lack the consistency that a structured approach can provide. The chosen examples (which I hope are randomly sampled; are they?) do seem to suggest the efficacy of this approach with that intuition.\n\nComments:\n\nShould probably cite CNN/DailyMail when it is first introduced as NLSummarization in Section 2 like you do the other datasets.\n\nCan you further elaborate on how your approach is similar to and differs from that in Marcheggiani et al 2017 on Graph CNNs for Semantic Role Labeling, Bastings et al 2017 on Graph Convolutional Encoders for Syntax-aware Machine Translation, and De Cao et al 2018? Why should one elect to go the direction of sequential GNNs over the GCNs of those other works, and how might you compare against them? I would like to see some kind of ablation analysis or direct comparison with similar methods if possible.\n\nWhy would GNNs hurt SelfAtt performance on MethodDoc C# SelfAtt+GNN / SelfAtt?\n\nWhy not add the coverage mechanism from See et al 2017 in order to demonstrate that the method does in fact surpass that prior work? I'm left wondering whether the proposed method's returns diminish once coverage is added.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper621/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Structured Neural Summarization", "abstract": "Summarization of long sequences into a concise statement is a core problem in natural language processing, requiring non-trivial understanding of the input.
