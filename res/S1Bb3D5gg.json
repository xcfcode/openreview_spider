All data is generated in the restaurant setting, where the goal is to find availability and eventually book a table based on parameters provided by the user to the bot as part of a dialog.  Data is generated by running a simulation using an underlying knowledge base to generate samples for the different parameters (cuisine, price range, etc), and then applying rule-based transformations to render natural language descriptions. The objective is to rank a set of candidate responses for each next turn of the dialog, and evaluation is reported in terms of per-response accuracy and per-dialog accuracy. The authors show that Memory Networks are able to improve over basic bag-of-words baselines.\n\nTHOUGHTS:\nI want to thank the authors for an interesting contribution.  Having said that, I am skeptical about the utility of end-to-end trained systems in the narrow-domain setting. In the open-domain setting, there is a strong argument to be made that hand-coding all states and responses would not scale, and hence end-to-end trained methods make a lot of sense. However, in the narrow-domain setting, we usually know and understand the domain quite well, and the goal is to obtain high user satisfaction. Doesn't it then make sense in these cases to use the domain knowledge to engineer the best system possible?\n\nGiven that the domain is already restricted, I'm also a bit disappointed that the goal is to RANK instead of GENERATE responses, although I understand that this makes evaluation much easier. I'm also unsure how these candidate responses would actually be obtained in practice? It seems that the models rank the set of all responses in train/val/test (last sentence before Sec 3.2). Since a key argument for the end-to-end training approach is ease of scaling to new domains without having to manually re-engineer the system, where is this information obtained for a new domain in practice?  Generating responses would allow much better generalization to new domains, as opposed to simply ranking some list of hand-collected generic responses, and in my mind this is the weakest part of this work.\n\nFinally, as data is generated using a simulation by expanding (cuisine, price, ...) tuples using NL-generation rules, it necessarily constrains the variability in the training responses. Of course, this is traded off with the ability to generate unlimited data using the simulator. But I was unable to see the list of rules that was used. It would be good to publish this as well.\n\nOverall, despite my skepticism, I think it is an interesting contribution worthy of publication at the conference. \n\n------\n\nI've updated my score following the clarifications and new results.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog", "abstract": "Traditional dialog systems used in goal-oriented applications require a lot of domain-specific handcrafting, which hinders scaling up to new domains.

The dataset and tasks are constructed artificially using rule-based programs, in such a way that different aspects of dialogue system performance can be evaluated ranging from issuing API calls to displaying options, as well as full-fledged dialogue.\n\nThis is a welcome contribution to the dialogue literature, which will help facilitate future research into developing and understanding dialogue systems. Still, there are pitfalls in taking this approach. First, it is not clear how suitable Deep Learning models are for these tasks compared to traditional methods (rule-based systems or shallow models), since Deep Learning models are known to require many training examples and therefore performance difference between different neural networks may simply boil down to regularization techniques. The tasks 1-5 are also completely deterministic, which means evaluating performance on these tasks won't measure the ability of the models to handle noisy and ambiguous interactions (e.g. inferring a distribution over user goals, or executing dialogue repair strategies), which is a very important aspect in dialogue applications. Overall, I still believe this is an interesting direction to explore.\n\nAs discussed in the comments below, the paper does not have any baseline model with word order information. I think this is a strong weakness of the paper, because it makes the neural networks appear unreasonably strong, yet simpler baselines could very likely be be competitive (or better) than the proposed neural networks. To maintain a fair evaluation and correctly assess the power of representation learning for this task, I think it's important that the authors experiment with one additional non-neural network benchmark model which takes into account word order information. This would more convincly demonstrate the utility of Deep Learning models for this task. For example, the one could experiment with a logistic regression model which takes as input 1) word embeddings (similar to the Supervised Embeddings model), 2) bi-gram features, and 3) match-type features. If such a baseline is included, I will increase my rating to 8.\n\n\n\nFinal minor comment: in the conclusion, the paper states \"the existing work has no well defined measures of performances\". This is not really true. End-to-end trainable models for task-oriented dialogue have well-defined performance measures. See, for example \"A Network-based End-to-End Trainable Task-oriented Dialogue System\" by Wen et al. On the other hand, non-goal-oriented dialogue are generally harder to evaluate, but given human subjects these can also be evaluated. In fact, this is what Liu et al (2016) do for Twitter.

Our paper should not be interpreted as a manual on how to build a restaurant booking bot in practice, but mostly as a way to address generalizability across all domains. We use the restaurant booking domain as a pretext for outlining key capabilities that a dialog system should have (querying KBs, sorting options, etc.) and we use this to study end-to-end models, a subset of all possible dialog systems. The choice of restaurant booking is meant to make comparisons to existing methods easier, but the value of domain-knowledge-free methods is that they generalize to all domains.

This paper represents a serious reality check. While it is mostly relevant for Dialog/Natural Language venues (to educate software engineer about the limitations of current chatbots), it can also be published at Machine Learning venues (to educate researchers about the need for more realistic validation of ML applied to dialogs), so I would consider this work of  high significance.\n\nTwo important conjectures are underlying this paper and likely to open to more research. While they are not in writing, Antoine Bordes clearly stated them during a NIPS workshop presentation that covered this work. Considering the metrics chosen in this paper:\n1)\tThe performance of end2end ML approaches is still insufficient for goal oriented dialogs.\n2)\tWhen comparing algorithms, relative performance on synthetic data is a good predictor of performance on natural data. This would be quite a departure from previous observations, but the authors made a strong effort to match the synthetic and natural conditions.\n\nWhile its original algorithmic contribution consists in one rather simple addition to memory networks (match type), it is the first time these are deployed and tested on a goal-oriented dialog, and the experimental protocol is excellent. The overall paper clarity is excellent and accessible to a readership beyond ML and dialog researchers. I was in particular impressed by how the short appendix on memory networks summarized them so well, followed by the tables that explained the influence of the number of hops.\n\nWhile this paper represents the state-of-the-art in the exploration of more rigorous metrics for dialog modeling, it also reminds us how brittle and somewhat arbitrary these remain. Note this is more a recommendation for future research than  for revision.\n\nFirst they use the per-response accuracy (basically the next utterance classification among a fixed list of responses). Looking at table 3 clearly shows how absurd this can be in practice: all that matters is a correct API call and a reasonably short dialog, though this would only give us a 1/7 accuracy, as the 6 bot responses needed to reach the API call also have to be exact.\n\nWould the per-dialog accuracy, where all responses must be correct, be better? Table 2 shows how sensitive it is to the experimental protocol. I was initially puzzled that the accuracy for subtask T3 (0.0) was much lower that the accuracy for the full dialog T5 (19.7), until the authors pointed me to the tasks definitions (3.1.1) where T3 requires displaying 3 options while T5 only requires displaying one.\n\nFor the concierge data, what would happen if \u2018correct\u2019 meant being the best, not among the 5-best? \n\nWhile I cannot fault the authors for using standard dialog metrics, and coming up with new ones that are actually too pessimistic, I can think of one way to represent dialogs that could result in more meaningful metrics in goal oriented dialogs. Suppose I sell Virtual Assistants as a service, being paid upon successful completion of a dialog. What is the metric that would maximize my revenue? In this restaurant problem, the loss would probably be some weighted sum of the number of errors in the API call, the number of turns to reach that API call and the number of rejected options by the user. However, such as loss cannot be measured on canned dialogs and would either require a real human user or an realistic simulator\n\nAnother issue closely related to representation learning that this paper fails to address or explain properly is what happens if the vocabulary used by the user does not match exactly the vocabulary in the knowledge base. In particular, for the match type algorithm to code \u2018Indian\u2019 as \u2018type of cuisine\u2019, this word would have to occur exactly in the KB. I can imagine situations where the KB uses some obfuscated terminology, and we would like ML to learn the associations rather than humans to hand-describe them.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog", "abstract": "Traditional dialog systems used in goal-oriented applications require a lot of domain-specific handcrafting, which hinders scaling up to new domains.

First, MemNNs augmented with match type features are among the best performing recent models, and it is far from clear that all end-to-end models would perform as well on the 3 tasks this model solves; we believe it would be useful for researchers using other models to check whether they also solve those tasks. Second, there is room for progress as long as performance is not 100%. In fact, two papers have already appeared with new models using this testbed:\nLiu and Perez, \"Gated End-to-End Memory Networks\",  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.04211v2.pdf  and Seo et al., \"QUERY-REDUCTION NETWORKS FOR QUESTION ANSWERING\". These papers reduce the error rate on task 3 to 25% and 8%, respectively, but still do not solve it.
