Such action dependent baseline can be used in settings where the action can be decomposed into factors that are conditionally dependent given the state. The paper:\n(1) shows that using separate baselines for actions, each of which can depend on the state and other actions is bias-free\n(2) derive the optimal action-dependent baseline, showing that it does not degenerate into state-only dependent baseline, i.e. there is potentially room for improvement over state-only baselines.\n(3) suggests using marginalized action-value (Q) function as a practical baseline, generalizing the use of value function in state-only baseline case.\n(4) suggests using MC marginalization and also using the \"average\" action to improve computational feasibility\n(5) combines the method with GAE techniques to further improve convergence by trading off bias and variance\n\nThe suggested methods are empirically evaluated on a number of settings. Overall action-dependent baseline outperform state-only versions. Using a single average action marginalization is on par with MC sampling, which the authors attribute to the low quality of the Q estimate. Combining GAE shows that a hint of bias can be traded off with further variance reduction to further improve the performance.\n\nI find the paper interesting and practical to the application of policy gradient in high dimensional action spaces with some level of conditional independence present in the action space. In light of such results, one might change the policy space to enforce such structure.\n\nNotes:\n- Elaborate further on the assumption made in Eqn 9. Does it mean that the actions factors cannot share (too many) parameters in the policy construction, or that shared parameters can only be applied to the state?\n- Eqn 11 should use \\simeq\n- How can the notion of average be extended to handle multi-modal distributions, or categorical or structural actions? Consider expanding on that in section 4.5.\n- The discussion on the DAG graphical model is lacking experimental analysis (where separate baselines models are needed).

The proposed approach justifies the utilization of action-dependent baselines, and quantifies the gains achieved by it over more general state-dependent or static baselines.\n\n\nThe writing and organization of the paper is very well done. It is easy to follow, and succinct while being comprehensive. The baseline definition is well-motivated, and the benefits offered by it are quantified intuitively. There is only one mostly minor issues with the algorithm development and the experiments need to be more polished. \n\nFor the algorithm development, there is an relatively strong assumption that z_i^T z_j = 0. This assumption is not completely unrealistic (for example, it is satisfied if completely separate parts of a feature vector are used for actions). However, it should be highlighted as an assumption, and it should be explicitly stated as z_i^T z_j = 0 rather than z_i^T z_j approx 0. Further, because it is relatively strong of an assumption, it should be discussed more thoroughly, with some explicit examples of when it is satisfied.\n\nOtherwise, the idea is simple and yet effective, which is exactly what we would like for our algorithms. The paper would be a much stronger contribution, if the experiments could be improved. \n- More details regarding the experiments are desirable - how many runs were done, the initialization of the policy network and action-value function, the deep architecture used etc.\n- The experiment in Figure 3 seems to reinforce the influence of \\lambda as concluded by the Schulman et. al. paper. While that is interesting, it seems unnecessary/non-relevant here, unless performance with action-dependent baselines with each value of \\lambda is contrasted to the state-dependent baseline. What was the goal here?\n- In general, the graphs are difficult to read; fonts should be improved and the graphs polished. \n- The multi-agent task needs to be explained better - specifically how is the information from the other agent incorporated in an agent's baseline?\n- It'd be great if Plot (a) and (b) in Figure 5 are swapped.\n\nOverall I think the idea proposed in the paper is beneficial. Better discussing the strong theoretical assumption should be incorporated. Adding the listed suggestions to the experiments section would really help highlight the advantage of the proposed baseline in a more clear manner. Particularly with some clarity on the experiments, I would be willing to increase the score. \n\nMinor comments:\n1. In Equation (28) how is the optimal-state dependent baseline obtained? This should be explicitly shown, at least in the appendix. \n2. The listed site for videos and additional results is not active.\n3.

These suggestions and questions are reflected in the updated article. We have added the derivation of the optimal-state dependent baseline (based on Greensmith, et al., 2004) in Appendix A, and a video has since been uploaded to the site. We have added experiment details to Appendix G, and have clarified baselines for multi-agent settings in Section 5 (Figure 4b). Thank you also for noting the typos! We have updated the manuscript to reflect these changes and included a clarification of our notation in Section 3.1, paragraph 1. We have addressed your key points below and incorporated the discussion into the new revision of the article.\n\n> For the algorithm development, there is an relatively strong assumption that z_i^T z_j = 0. This\n> assumption is not completely unrealistic (for example, it is satisfied if completely separate parts\n> of a feature vector are used for actions). However, it should be highlighted as an assumption, \n> and it should be explicitly stated as z_i^T z_j = 0 rather than z_i^T z_j approx 0. Further, because \n> it is relatively strong of an assumption, it should be discussed more thoroughly, with some \n> explicit examples of when it is satisfied.\n\nThank you for this very important observation. We have revised the manuscript to state this assumption explicitly and have also provided examples where it is satisfied (in Section 4.2, paragraph 1). We note however that this assumption is primarily for the theoretical analysis to be clean, and is not required to run the algorithm in practice. In particular, even without this assumption, the proposed baseline is bias-free. When the assumption holds, the optimal action-dependent baseline has a clean form which we can analyze thoroughly. As noted by the reviewer, the assumption is not very realistic. Some examples where these assumptions hold include multi-agent settings where the policies are conditionally independent by construction, cases where the policy acts based on independent components [1] of the observation space, and cases where different function approximators are used to control different actions or synergies [2,3] without weight sharing.\n\n[1] Y.

What was the goal here?\n\nThank you for the great question. Our goal was to emphasize that one does not lose out on temporal difference based variance reduction approaches like GAE, which are complimentary to reducing variance caused by high dimensionality of action space considered in this work.
