Answers are produced in three phases: a retrieval-based model extracts candidate answers; a generator model, conditioned on retrieved answers, produces an additional candidate; a reranker outputs the best among all candidates.\n\nThe approach is interesting: the proposed ensemble can improve on both the retrieval module and the generation module, since it does not restrict modeling power (e.g. the generator is not forced to be consistent with the candidates). I am not aware of similar approaches for this task. One work that comes to mind regarding the blend of retrieval and generation is Memory Networks (e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03126.pdf and references): given a query, a set of relevant memories is extracted from a KB using an inverted index and the memories are fed into the generator. However, the extracted items in the current work are candidate answers which are used both to feed the generator and to participate in reranking.\n\nThe experimental section focuses on the task of building conversational systems. The performance measures used are 1) a human evaluation score with three volunteers and 2) BLUE scores. While these methods are not very satisfying, effective evaluation of such systems is a known difficulty. \n\nThe results show that the ensemble outperforms the individual modules, indicating that: the multi-seq2seq models have learned to use the new inputs as needed and that the ranker is correlated with the evaluation metrics.\n\nHowever, the results themselves do not look impressive to me: the subjective evaluation is close to the \"borderline\" score; in the examples provided, one is good, the other is borderline/bad, and the baseline always provides something very short. Does the LSTM work particularly poor on this dataset? Given that this is a novel dataset, I don't know what the state-of-the-art should be. Could you provide more insight? Have you considered adding a benchmark dataset (e.g. a QA dataset)?\n\nSpecific questions:\n\n1. The paper motivates conditioning on the candidates in two ways. First, that the candidates bring additional information which the decoder can use (e.g. read from the candidates locations, actions, etc.). Second, that the probability of universal replies must decrease due to the additional condition. I think the second argument depends on how the conditioning is performed: if the candidates are simply appended to the input, the model can learn to ignore them.\n2. The copy mechanism is a nice touch, encouraging the decoder to use the provided queries. Why not copy from the query too, e.g. with some answers reusing part of the query <\"Where are you going?\", \"I'm going to the park\">?\n3. How often does the model select the generated answer vs. the extracted answers? In both examples provided the selected answer is the one merging the candidate answers.\n\nMinor issues:\n- Section 3.2: using and the state\n- Section 3.2: more than one replies\n- last sentence on page 3: what are the \"following principles\"?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Ensemble of Retrieval-Based and Generation-Based Human-Computer Conversation Systems.", "abstract": "Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing.

For several of the GBDT features, the approach chosen is unusual or perhaps outdated. In particular, the choice of a word-level MT-based metric rather than an utterance-level one, and the choice of a bigram-based fluency metric rather than one based on a more complete language model are puzzling and should be justified.\n2. The authors report primarily comparisons to ablations of their own model, not to other recent work in dialog systems.\n3. The human evaluation performance of a simple reranking ensemble between the authors' generation-based model and their retrieval-based model is significantly higher than multi-seq2seq, suggesting that multi-seq2seq may not be an especially powerful way to combine information from the two models.\n4.

Then a concatenation of the query and the candidates are fed into a generative model to generate an additional artificial candidate.\nIn a final step, the k+1 candidates are re-ranked to report the final response.\nEach of these steps involves careful engineering and for each there are some minor novel components.\nYet, not all of the steps are presented in complete technical detail.\nAlso, training corpora and human labeling of the test data do not seem to be publicly available.\nConsequently, it would be hard to exactly reproduce the results of the paper.\nExperimental validation also is relatively thin.\nWhile the paper report both BLEU metrics and Fleiss kappa from a small-scale human test, the results are based on a single split of a single corpus into training, validation and test data.\nWhile the results for the ensemble are reported to be higher than for the various components for almost all metrics, measures of spread/variance would allow the reader to better judge the degree and significance of improvement.\n\nMinor:\nThe paper should be read by a native speaker, as it involves a number of minor grammar issues and typos.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Ensemble of Retrieval-Based and Generation-Based Human-Computer Conversation Systems.", "abstract": "Human-computer conversation systems have attracted much attention in Natural Language Processing. Conversation systems can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information. The generated reply together with the retrieved ones then participates in a re-ranking process to find the final reply to output. Experimental results show that such an ensemble system outperforms each single module by a large margin.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/79ba1e1fef02d9584a289be8067908ef7c1d4525.pdf", "TL;DR": "A novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based for open-domain conversation systems.", "paperhash": "song|an_ensemble_of_retrievalbased_and_generationbased_humancomputer_conversation_systems", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsong2018an,\ntitle={An Ensemble of Retrieval-Based and Generation-Based Human-Computer Conversation Systems.},\nauthor={Yiping Song and Rui Yan and Cheng-Te Li and Jian-Yun Nie and Ming Zhang and Dongyan Zhao},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sk03Yi10Z},\n}", "keywords": ["conversation systems", "retrieval method", "generation method"], "authors": ["Yiping Song", "Rui Yan", "Cheng-Te Li", "Jian-Yun Nie", "Ming Zhang", "Dongyan Zhao"], "authorids": ["songyiping@pku.edu.cn", "ruiyan@pku.edu.cn", "chengte@mail.ncku.edu.tw", "nie@iro.umontreal.ca", "mzhang_cs@pku.edu.cn", "zhaody@pku.edu.cn"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1511845199000, "tmdate": 1515642400451, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper159/Official_Review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper159/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper159/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper159/AnonReviewer3", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper159/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "Sk03Yi10Z", "replyto": "Sk03Yi10Z", "writers": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper159/AnonReviewer[0-9]+", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"required": true, "order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}"}, "rating": {"required": true, "order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"required": true, "order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1519621199000, "cdate": 1515642400451}}}], "count": 6}
