The top-k selection problem is phrased as a linear constraint reducing it to the problem of Lee et al.  The approach is illustrated on toy examples and a GAN application.\n\nThe main criticism of the problem is the novelty of the paper.  R1 feels that it is largely just the combination of two known approaches (although it appears that the incomplete estimator is key), while R3 was significantly more impressed.  Both are senior experts in the topic.\n\nOn the balance, the reviewers were more positive than negative.  R2 felt that the authors comments helped to address their concerns, while R3 gave detailed arguments in favor of the submission and championed the paper.

To achieve this, combining MMD and PSI is one of the simple approaches. To deal with the normality constraint in PSI, we also proposed an incomplete U-statistics estimator for MMD and showed basic theoretical properties of the estimator.

Right now it is hard to me to judge whether or not the proposed estimator is correct (the only place that seems to support this is Fig. 4(a). Where the p-value seems to be clear to a uniform distribution. \n\nThe main idea is to use an estimator of MMD with normal response to perform testing and selective inference. The proposed incomplete estimator randomly subsamples the U-stats kernels of MMD, and asymptotic normality follows from properties of incomplete U-statistics. In finite sample cases, the correctness of this estimator is supported by the uniform p-value distribution in Figure 4(a), and also the fact that the false positive rate is successfully controlled at the desired \\alpha in both synthetic and real datasets.\n\n>For instance, the proposed PSI estimator, we will need to estimate the covariance matrix. This was explained in Section 3.3, and it was said that the algorithm in Fan et al. (2013) was used for the explanation. However, I think more detailed discussions and explanation should be provided here. In order to obtain correct p-value estimate, I believe getting accurate covariance matrix estimate is crucial. How large the sample size is needed, in order for us to get an accurate enough covariance matrix, to perform sub-sequent post selection inference?\n\nFor hypothesis testing, the consistency of the covariance matrix estimator is necessary to get accurate covariance matrix estimates. In our PSI setup, the consistency of the covariance matrix estimator which corresponds to the result of Theorem 2 and its corollaries is derived under standard regularity conditions. \n\nIn practice, for the small number of samples, the estimation of covariance matrix is extremely hard. As shown in the Figure 6 of supplementary material, we experimentally found that the estimation error of the incomplete MMD covariance is smaller than that of the block MMD covariance. Moreover, for the incomplete U-statistics MMD, we have $\\ell=rn$ samples to estimate the covariance matrix, while we have only $n/B$ samples for the block MMD. That is, the number of samples that can be used for covariance estimation of the incomplete U-statistics estimator is $rB$ times larger than that of the block estimator. In the setup of Figure 6, we have $rB = 100$. For example, for $n = 1000$, we can use $5000$ samples for the incomplete U-statistics, while we have only $50$ samples for the block estimator. Thus, for the block MMD, this is problematic for high-dimensional case (e.g., d = 100), and the estimated covariance matrix is not full-rank. To alleviate this issue, we employ the POET algorithm for the block estimator.  \n\nMoreover, we run the PSI algorithms for the white wine dataset by changing the number of samples as 200, 400, \u2026, 4000. As can be seen, both PSI algorithms can control the FPR with 2000 samples. Moreover, it is clear that the incomplete U-statistics estimator can get better performance than the block estimator in both TPR and FPR.  We included this experimental result in the revised supplementary material (see Figure 8)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper111/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper111/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper111/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Post Selection Inference with Incomplete Maximum Mean Discrepancy Estimator", "abstract": "Measuring divergence between two distributions is essential in machine learning and statistics and has various applications including binary classification, change point detection, and two-sample test.

They propose a non-parametric approach under the PSI (post selection inference) umbrella using MMD (maximum mean discrepancy) as a discrepancy measure between probability distributions. The idea is to apply (asymptotically) normal MMD estimators, rephrase the top-k selection problem as a linear constraint, and reduce the problem to Lee et al., 2016. The efficiency of the approach is illustrated on toy examples and in GAN (generative adversarial network) context. The technique complements the PSI-based independence testing approach recently proposed by Yamada et al., 2018. \n\nThe submission is a well-organized, clearly written, nice contribution; it can be relevant to the machine learning community.\n\nBelow I enlist a few suggestions to improve the manuscript:\n-Section 1: The notion of characteristic kernel (kernel when MMD is metric) has not been defined, but it was referred to. 'Due to the mean embeddings in RKHS, all moment information is stored.': This sentence is somewhat vague.\n-Section 1: 'MMD can be computed in closed form'. This is rarely the case (except for e.g. Gaussian distributions with Gaussian or polynomial kernels). I assume that the authors wanted refer to the estimation of MMD.\n-Section 1: 'K nearest neighbor approaches (Poczos & Schneider, 2011)'. The citation to this specific estimator can go under alpha-divergences. The Wasserstein metric could also be mentioned.\n-Section 3.1: k is used to denote the number of selected features and also the kernel used in MMD. I suggest using different notations.\n-Theorem 1: '\\Phi is the CDF...'. There is no \\Phi in the theorem.\n-Section 3.2: The existence of MMD (mean embedding) requires certain assumptions: E_{x\\sim p}\\sqrt{k(x,x)} < \\infty, E_{x\\sim q}\\sqrt{k(x,x)} < \\infty.\n-Section 3.2.: block estimator: 'B_1 and B_2 are finite'. 'fixed'?\n-Section 3.2.: MMD_{inc}: \n   i) 'S_{n,k}': k looks superfluous.\n   ii) 'l': it has not been introduced (cardinality of D).\n-Section 3.3: typo: 'covraiance' (2x)\n-Section 3.3: Fan et al. 2013: The citation can go to \\citep{}.  \n-Theorem 2: \n   i)'c' is left undefined.\n   ii)Comma is missing before 'where'.\n   iii)\\xrightarrow{d} (Theorem 2, Corollary 3-4): Given that 'd' also denotes dimension in the submission, I suggest using a different notation for convergence in distribution.\n-At the introduction of block-MMD the block size (B) was fixed, while in the experiments (e.g. Figure 3) it is growing with the sample size (B=\\sqrt{n}). The assumption on B should be clearly stated.\n-Section 5.1: (b) mean shift: comma is missing before 'where'.\n-References: \n   i) Abbreviations and names in the titles should be capitalized (such as cramer, wasserstein, hilbert-schmidt, gan, nash). \n   ii) Scholkopf should be Sch\\{\"o}lkopf (in the ALT 2005 work).\n   iii) 'Exact post-selection inference, with application to the lasso': All the authors are listed; 'et al.' is not needed.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper111/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Post Selection Inference with Incomplete Maximum Mean Discrepancy Estimator", "abstract": "Measuring divergence between two distributions is essential in machine learning and statistics and has various applications including binary classification, change point detection, and two-sample test. Furthermore, in the era of big data, designing divergence measure that is interpretable and can handle high-dimensional and complex data becomes extremely important. In this paper, we propose a post selection inference (PSI) framework for divergence measure, which can select a set of statistically significant features that discriminate two distributions. Specifically, we employ an additive variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for features and introduce a general hypothesis test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which has an asymptotically normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically. Through synthetic and real-world feature selection experiments, we show that the proposed framework can successfully detect statistically significant features. Last, we propose a sample selection framework for analyzing different members in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) family.
