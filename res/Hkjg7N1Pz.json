The simulated study provides a reasonably convincing safety check, and the results on the real dataset are indeed interesting. My only concern regards the fact that only a single real dataset has been used: a wider experimental side would definitely provide a stronger support to the paper's claims. Moreover, it would be interesting to check the stability of the method as a function of the authors' choices within the procedure, e.g. the bins' size when partitioning the sorted set of mutations.\nOverall, I rate the paper as very interesting and well written, and I recommend it for acceptance.

They finally show that there is small discrepancy between their predicted mixtures and the ground truth. \nThe idea sounds interesting. Here are my issues:\n\n- It is not clear how this idea is inherently different from the methods based on mutation clustering, which is used in the past. Also, these traditional methods are not compared against the proposed method. \n- The latent model used in the paper (Sec. 2.2) is most interesting when the topics (\\mu_i) are unknown. Here the authors assume those patterns are provided a priori (48 signatures in PCAWG). It would be nice to ignore those and estimate them. This gives the method more flexibility (although making it challenging to compare against the ground truth).
