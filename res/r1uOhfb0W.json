To do this, the authors propose to (1) sample models using SG-MCMC with group sparse prior, (2) prune hidden units with small weights, (3) and retrain weights by optimizing each pruned model. The ensemble is applied to MNIST classification and language modelling on PTB dataset. \n\nI have two major concerns on the paper. First, the proposed procedure is quite empirically designed. So, it is difficult to understand why it works well in some problems. Particularly. the justification on the retraining phase is weak. It seems more like to use SG-MCMC to *initialize* models which will then be *optimized* to find MAP with the sparse-model constraints. The second problem is about the baselines in the MNIST experiments. The FNN-300-100 model without dropout, batch-norm, etc. seems unreasonably weak baseline. So, the results on Table 1 on this small network is not much informative practically. Lastly, I also found a significant effort is also desired to improve the writing. \n\nThe following reference also needs to be discussed in the context of using SG-MCMC in RNN.\n- \"Scalable Bayesian Learning of Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling\", Zhe Gan*, Chunyuan Li*, Changyou Chen, Yunchen Pu, Qinliang Su, Lawrence Carin", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Sparse Structured Ensembles with SG-MCMC and Network Pruning", "abstract": "An ensemble of neural networks is known to be more robust and accurate than an individual network, however usually with linearly-increased cost in both training and testing. \nIn this work, we propose a two-stage method to learn Sparse Structured Ensembles (SSEs) for neural networks.\nIn the first stage, we run SG-MCMC with group sparse priors to draw an ensemble of samples from the posterior distribution of network parameters.

As stated in the end of Section 3.2, there are two justifications for the retraining phase: First, theoretically (namely with infinite samples), model averaging does not need retraining. However, the actual number of samples used in practice is rather small for computational efficiency. So retraining essentially compensates for the limited size of samples for model averaging. Second, the MAP estimate is more likely than the network obtained just after pruning but before retraining. Retraining increases the posteriori probabilities of the networks in the ensemble and hopefully improves the prediction performance of the networks in the ensemble.\n\n> The second problem is about the baselines in the MNIST experiments. The FNN-300-100 model without dropout, batch-norm, etc. seems unreasonably weak baseline. So, the results on Table 1 on this small network is not much informative practically. \n\nSuch basic setting in the MNIST FNN experiments allows easy reproduction of the results.\nStrong results are reported on the more challenging LSTM LM task.\n\n> Lastly, I also found a significant effort is also desired to improve the writing.\n\nWe polish the paper and especially rewrite those parts after Sections 4.\n\n> The following reference also needs to be discussed in the context of using SG-MCMC in RNN. - \"Scalable Bayesian Learning of Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling\", Zhe Gan*, Chunyuan Li*, Changyou Chen, Yunchen Pu, Qinliang Su, Lawrence Carin\n\nThis work pioneers in applying SG-MCMC to Bayesian learning of RNNs, but without considering model pruning and the cost of model averaging.

However, the actual number of samples used in practice is rather small for computational efficiency. So retraining essentially compensates for the limited size of samples for model averaging. Second, the MAP estimate is more likely than the network obtained just after pruning but before retraining. Retraining increases the posteriori probabilities of the networks in the ensemble and hopefully improves the prediction performance of the networks in the ensemble.\n\nNote that running SGLD enhances exploration of the model-parameter space, and we take thinned collection of samples so that there are low correlations between the samples. So in contrary to converging to the same minimum after retraining, thinned samples from SGLD would lead to neighbors of different local minima and retraining further fine-tune the paramters to take different minima.\n\n> 2) \nThanks for your suggestion, we have changed the notation to dim(\\theta_g).\n\n> 3)\nWe polish the paper and especially rewrite those parts after Sections 4.\n\n> 4)\nThanks for your suggestion. The results of SGD (1 model) + GSP + PR and SGD (ensemble) + GSP + PR have been added to Table 5, with the discussion in the paragraph before the last paragraph in Section 5.2.\nSGD (1 model)+GSP+PR can reduce the model size but the PPL is much worse than the ensemble, which clearly shows the improvement provided by the ensemble. Additionally, we compare SGLD (4 models)+GSP+PR with SGD (4 models)+GSP+PR. The two ensembles achieve close PPLs. However, SGLD ensemble learning reduces about 30% training time.\n\n> 5)\nWe empirically find that 90% is the highest pruning rate without hurting performance for LSTMs.\n\n> 6)\nTypos have been fixed."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Sparse Structured Ensembles with SG-MCMC and Network Pruning", "abstract": "An ensemble of neural networks is known to be more robust and accurate than an individual network, however usually with linearly-increased cost in both training and testing. \nIn this work, we propose a two-stage method to learn Sparse Structured Ensembles (SSEs) for neural networks.\nIn the first stage, we run SG-MCMC with group sparse priors to draw an ensemble of samples from the posterior distribution of network parameters.
