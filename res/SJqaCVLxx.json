And also the GPU extended for deep learning.\n\n\"What are its advantages/dis-advantages\":\n\none of advantages is not need back-prop operation only needs the feed forward operation in LeNet-5; On other hand, not needed the calculation of derivation. That is useful in parallel processing. Perhaps, our approach could be useful in artificial brain in robots; I have still worked on this idea for learinig a few pattern in different dataset (like merging the MINST and NORB).\n\n\"the results reported are RMSE as opposed to classification error. Why is that the case\":\n\nIn some figures we have selected the best RMSE in the different iterations.\nIn Some plot we have showed all RMSE that generated in iterations. Since the system of LeNet-5 is NP-complete the RMSE have different values. In final iteration the population sorted by ranking with two objects that minimized(RMSE and MCR); therefore, the best individuals use for weights of LeNet-5. \n\n\"The authors seem to have merged the training and validation set of the MNIST dataset and use only a subset of it\":\n\nI had to select the few pattern from the famous dataset. My laptop has two core of cpu. therefore I had to use small pack for calculating.\n\nThus, the dataset have 50 samples in 10 classes. I learn the whole sample based on k-folded.

My motivation was to find the method that have been not back propagation; the feed forward rendering is 5 times faster than the back propagation. Our approche in parallel can be run fast ratio with the SGD.\n\nI am studied in AI.

For this, come under the chronological of my research:  \n\nnote: the best results selected from the iterations in practices and show average them with 5 experiments.\n\n1) started Searching by reading the all of article in CNN and deep learning.\n2) Started study about Filters and vision specially on TICA filters and filters of Mammal like rats and Macaques.\n3) Practiced on the heuristics and evolutionary algorithms likes GA, PSO, Coco and so on.\n4) Focused on PSO algorithm (particle swarm organization) for fast converge with 100 to 1000 iterations.\n6) The main PSO tested up 1000 times with set different respective parameters but the learning failed (Minimizing the RMSE); This showed in the article that the PSO practices no help to minimizing the error(RMSE=x Single-objective optimization). several functions tested in the pso`s cost function like X power 2 and log2x end others famous.\n7) The main GA tested like the PSO practices. And the result showed in article failed.\n8) I have tested the PSO and GA chromosome that initialized with famous vision filters like TICE filters. And the result showed in article failed.\n9) I am noticed that the good individual remove from population. I should maked a decision: Change the PSO code or GA for my propose or finding the other version. I decided to find an algorithm that have been in native to do not remove the good individual.\n10) I have worked on the NSGA-II one of type of GA algorithm (Multi-objective optimization;RSME and MCR). It work good but have problem to minimize the errors despite of used the TICA filters and RMSE Single-objective optimization.\n11) Finally,with my scholar in this fields and get the minimum and maximum value of the SGD LeNet-5 wieghts , I have used the TICA filters for initializing their chromosomes in population. \n12) For obtaining the individuals that have minimum error I used two stage for learning with different parameters (Discraibed in proposal section).\n\nAt The end, I try to rewrite the article for excepting.

Neither do the authors ever motivate why do such a training as opposed to the standard back-prop. What are its advantages/dis-advantages? Furthermore the experimental section is equally unclear. The authors seem to have merged the training and validation set of the MNIST dataset and use only a subset of it. It is not clear why is that the case and what subset they use. In addition, to the best of my understanding, the results reported are RMSE as opposed to classification error. Why is that the case? \n\nIn short, the paper is extremely hard to follow and it is not at all clear what the training algorithm is and how is it better than standard way of training. The experimental section is equally confusing and unconvincing. \n\nOther comments: \n-- The figures still say LeCun-5\n-- The legends of the plots are not in english.

The current version of this paper seems improved compared to the initial version, but still far from a finished level.  I'd encourage the authors to keep editing over the language and presentation.\n\nI also think it would be good to also try answering some of the following questions very clearly in the paper:\n\n- What is the advantage, if any, of the proposed algorithm over SGD?  What is the motivation and goal of the work beyond MNIST benchmarking?\n\n- Why are few training examples used?  Is this a scenario in which the system might have an advantage?\n\n- Concretely describe the genetic algorithms terminology used in the algorithm descriptions, and what each term means in the context of the convolutional network.\n\n- Try to make sure that the method, as described, can be understood by a reader without much prior background on genetic algorithms.\n\n- A single experiment on MNIST is too small to adequately describe the algorithm performance.  Consider using a second or third dataset and/or experimental application.\n\nMuch work is still needed on the paper's writing before it can be understood well enough.  I hope that some of this might be useful in helping to improve. I would encourage the authors to try to find outside readers, preferably fluent in English, to work with on a frequent basis before resubmitting to another venue.\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "New Learning Approach By Genetic Algorithm In A Convolutional Neural Network For Pattern Recognition", "abstract": "Almost all of the presented articles in the CNN  are based on the error backpropagation algorithm and calculation of derivations of error, our innovative proposal refers to engaging TICA  filters and NSGA-II  genetic algorithms to train the LeNet-5 CNN network.

It would be great to edit this down and make it more concise.\n\nFurther proof-reading and editing for English would also be a major improvement.  There are many odd phrases and misplaced parts of speech, which unfortunately makes the paper very hard for me to follow.  (For example, \"The purpose has ferreted out a novelty approach to train the weights ...\", first sentence of Sec 2; ).\n\nFor this audience, I suspect much of the background on LeCun-5 and TICA are not so much needed, and those might be a couple places to start making cuts.  The additional background on NSGA-II is nice, as I haven't seen this algorithm before myself, but I think the overall idea to this approach could be more clearly stated early on.  This section also uses terminology that I am not entirely familiar with, and explaining these would help, too.  For example, the initial explaining sentence in sec 1.3 says, NSGA-II \"stores all of the information of dominated particles\nand the number of domination for each particle\".  But what is a \"particle\" in this application, and what does it mean to be \"dominated\"?\n\nOn a different note, I haven't yet found any discussion comparing this approach to gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.  I feel a discussion of key differences and advantages would be helpful, as would a direct experimental comparison, since SGD is a simple and very common approach for training a LeCun-5 net.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "New Learning Approach By Genetic Algorithm In A Convolutional Neural Network For Pattern Recognition", "abstract": "Almost all of the presented articles in the CNN  are based on the error backpropagation algorithm and calculation of derivations of error, our innovative proposal refers to engaging TICA  filters and NSGA-II  genetic algorithms to train the LeNet-5 CNN network.
