The authors claimed the proposed method could help with exploding gradient  in training the linear memories. It would be helpful to include some experiments indicating that this was the case (for the baseline) and that this method does indeed help with this problem.\n>>> 4. In general, it seems that the experiments could be more carefully designed to reflect the contributions of the proposed method. Some suggestions for future edits are, more analysis on gradients, maybe more experiments on the stability of training such as gradients could help.\n\nWe agree that this are interesting experiments. We believe that it is especially useful to study the effect on the gradient and training stability when combined with the truncated backpropagation (e.g. as done in the LSTM paper). Unfortunately, we still do not have the final results on these experiments.\n\n\n>>> 2. The experiments on the copy task only showed results for length upto 500, which almost all baseline models are able to solve. I am not too sure how the proposed initialization helps in this case. \n \nWe used the experiments on the copy tasks to show that the LMN architecture learns the copy task with a saturating nonlinearity (tanh). As far as we know, this is the only architecture that can do it, while most of the other models use variations of ReLUs.\n\n\n>>> 1. There are some confusions, on P2 \"we can construct a simple linear recurrent model which uses the autoencoder to encode the input sequences within a single vector\", I think the authors meant encode the input sequences into a sequence of vectors? Equation 1 and 2 suggest that there is a vector m^t per timestep (as oppose to having 1 for the entire sequence). \n \nThe state vector of the LAES m^t can be used to reconstruct the entire input sequence x^1, \u2026 x^t. Therefore, each vector m^t encodes the entire subsequence x^1, \u2026, x^t. We will update the paper to make this point clearer.\n\n\n>>> 2. Although the copy task was used in ((Arjovsky et al., 2015), I believe the original task was proposed in the following paper and hence this citation should properly be the correct one to cite here\n \nThank you for noticing this, we will add the reference.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2202/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2202/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["antonio.carta@di.unipi.it", "sperduti@math.unipd.it", "bacciu@di.unipi.it"], "title": "Autoencoder-based Initialization for Recurrent Neural Networks with a Linear Memory", "authors": ["Antonio Carta", "Alessandro Sperduti", "Davide Bacciu"], "pdf": "/pdf/e7903a2bb7758958cfa6fbd152992bbf4d1b5816.pdf", "TL;DR": "We show how to initialize recurrent architectures with the closed-form solution of a linear autoencoder for sequences.

But these are not minor changes and radically change the inductive bias of the models.  The LSTM uses the forget gate to reset the cell state activations, while the LMN uses a more efficient encoding and does not forget past activations. The result of this choice is that the LMN is better on tasks that require the memorization of long sequences (e.g. copy task, MNIST). On different tasks, like language modeling, other architectures (like the LSTM) are probably a better choice since the problem does not require explicit memorization.\n\n\nYou are correct that the initialization scheme come from a previous contribution.  However, what we show here is that such initialization is more coherent with the assumption and nature of the LMN, rather than for a RNN with non-linear memory. We also show how that the autoencoder initialization can help in some tasks (improving both the results of orthogonal and gated models) and hinder the performance in others. These results show that the proposed approach is complementary to LSTMs and other gated architectures, and that the two approaches can be used to solve different tasks of different nature (in terms of long and short-term memorization abilities). We are not aware of other researches investigating the differences between encoding/orthogonal-based approaches and gated models and the capabilities of the different memorization schemes (which, to the extent of our understanding, appears a relevant topic for ICLR).\n \n\n>>> For the experiment part, the first two tasks are a bit toyish in 2019\nWe agree that some of the benchmarks are simple tasks. However, the chosen datasets are used to compare against classic benchmarks in the literature of orthogonal RNNs.  Most of the papers in the literature use pixel-MNIST.\n[1] copy task, pixel-MNIST, PTB\n[2] copy task, TIMIT, pixel-MNIST\n[3] pixel-MNIST, pixel-CIFAR10\n[4] copy, MNIST, TIMIT, PTB, MIDI\n\nIf the reviewer is aware of different benchmarks allowing to compare with the related literature we will gladly consider it.\n\n\n>>> Even for the TIMIT dataset, the results are a bit far from state-of-the-art which makes the paper's claim less convincing. \nThank you for noticing this. The results may seem poor because we do not use bidirectional models. This is done to compare against [4].

The proposed initialization is aimed at helping to maintain longer-term memory and instability during training such as  exploding gradients (due to linearity).\n\nPros:\n\n1. The paper is well written, the motivation and methods are clearly described.\n\nCons.\n\n1. The authors claimed the proposed method could help with exploding gradient  in training the linear memories. It would be helpful to include some experiments indicating that this was the case (for the baseline) and that this method does indeed help with this problem.\n\n2. The experiments on the copy task only showed results for length upto 500, which almost all baseline models are able to solve. I am not too sure how the proposed initialization helps in this case.\n\n3. TIMNIT is a relatively small speech recognition dataset. The task/ dataset does not require long-term memorization. It is nice to see that the initialization helps in this case. However, it is still a little how this experiment corresponds to the messsage that the authors are attempting to deliver at the end of the introduction.\n\n4. In general, it seems that the experiments could be more carefully designed to reflect the contributions of the proposed method. Some suggestions for future edits are, more analysis on gradients, maybe more experiments on the stability of training such as gradients could help.\n\nMinor:\n\n1. There are some confusions, on P2 \"we can construct a simple linear recurrent model which uses the autoencoder to encode the input sequences within a single vector\", I think the authors meant encode the input sequences into a sequence of vectors? Equation 1 and 2 suggest that there is a vector m^t per timestep (as oppose to having 1 for the entire sequence).\n\n2. Although the copy task was used in ((Arjovsky et al., 2015), I believe the original task was proposed in the following paper and hence this citation should properly be the correct one to cite here,\n\nHochreiter, Sepp and Schmidhuber, J\u00fcrgen.

First, the LMN seems to be a simpler version of LSTM and it has no significant advantages compared with other recurrent structures introduced in the past several years.\nSecond, the autoencoder-based init scheme (Pasa&Sperduti, 2014) is not new while the only technical contribution of this paper is a minor change of this scheme so that it works for the LMN. In my opinion, combining these two (LMN and init scheme) can hardly be considered as a solid novelty contribution.\nFor the experiment part, the first two tasks are a bit toyish in 2019 and I have not seen any significant improvement gained from the proposed model. Even for the TIMIT dataset, the results are a bit far from state-of-the-art which makes the paper's claim less convincing.\n\nOverall I think the novelty contribution is marginal and I suggest the authors to test their models on larger-scale real problems.\n\nThe writing is clear and easy to follow."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2202/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2202/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["antonio.carta@di.unipi.it", "sperduti@math.unipd.it", "bacciu@di.unipi.it"], "title": "Autoencoder-based Initialization for Recurrent Neural Networks with a Linear Memory", "authors": ["Antonio Carta", "Alessandro Sperduti", "Davide Bacciu"], "pdf": "/pdf/e7903a2bb7758958cfa6fbd152992bbf4d1b5816.pdf", "TL;DR": "We show how to initialize recurrent architectures with the closed-form solution of a linear autoencoder for sequences.
