A shortcoming of VIN lies in its spatially invariant convolutional kernel of fixed size and the computational cost growth in order with respect to the optimal path lengths.   \n\nTo address these challenges, by viewing VIN as a recurrent convolutional network, the paper proposed LSTMIN which replaces the iteration map by convolutional LSTM which is suggested by (Shi et al. 2015) for 2D precipitation nowcasting and allows more bias relaxation. In some preliminary experiments on 15x15 2D mazes (News and Differential-Drive), the proposed scheme shows better efficiency in reaching optimal paths with a better variance control at various kernel sizes and depth lengths than the VIN and its naive extension Hyper-VIN by heterogeneous weight relaxations. In appendix further empirical results on 3D mazes and with QMDP-Nets also show that LSTMIN performs slightly better than VIN. \n\nIn a summary, this is an interesting exploration on LSTM-based value iteration scheme.  Some questions include: \n\n1. As both VIN and LSTMIN mimic the VI algorithm, could you briefly discuss why the original VI algorithm does not effectively find the optimal paths in the 2D mazes while these deep networks versions can have supreme performance than the original VI? \n\n2. There are other recurrent structures like GRU, are they performing similarly as LSTM used in this work?\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LSTM Iteration Networks: An Exploration of Differentiable Path Finding", "abstract": "Our motivation is to scale value iteration to larger environments without a huge increase in computational demand, and fix the problems inherent to Value Iteration Networks (VIN) such as spatial invariance and unstable optimization.
