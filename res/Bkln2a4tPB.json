As done in previous related papers, some challenging video datasets can be used for more convincing evaluation.\"\n\nOur focus is more on traditional time series modelling (which we note is a respectable area of research). Mocap data, which has a rich structure and moderately high dimensionality, is a good demonstration of contributions to this area. Our aim is to provide a holistic view of the situations where using an MTDS framework is likely to be useful, and those where it may not be. \n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n2. \"The compared baseline models are too weak, given that no state-of-the-art model is compared.\"\n\nWe believe the baselines for the mocap data are fairly strong: the pooled GRU model is close to state of the art in the mocap literature [1]. In traditional benchmarks, this pooled approach cannot easily be beaten, but we consider different quantitative benchmarks that demonstrate the importance of explicit sequence customization. Various models proposed recently in the disentangled literature might also be co-opted to our context (these are typically concerned with demonstrating disentanglement, perhaps from large amounts of data, e.g. Miladinovi\u0107 et al., 2019). Our goal of exploiting customization is a complementary viewpoint. \n\nWe have updated the introduction to give more prominence to this recent work. Importantly, we have also performed new experiments with a (deterministic state) version of Miladinovi\u0107 et al.: this performs poorly for customizing LDS models, but fairly well for RNNs. Nevertheless, our MTDS approach is superior in terms of data efficiency and user control, more details can be found in the updated version of the paper. We have decided against implementing Yingzhen et al. (2018) since it is unable to customize dynamics, and Hsu et al. (2018) would effectively result in the same model as Miladinovi\u0107 et al..\n\n                                                                                       ***\n\nFootnotes:\n[1]: As stated in the paper, this follows Martinez et al., 2017. As far as we are aware, the current state of the art is held by Pavllo et al. 2018, via the use of various data augmentation and pre-processing tricks, as well as possibly use of quaternion arithmetic in the RNN.

In particular, it has been helpful in revising our introduction. We hope that the below helps to clarify these points, please let us know otherwise.\n\n                          ***\n\n1. \"The main motivation of this paper is to treat each sequence as a task in the training set.. What are the advantages of this setting for sequence generation?\" ... \"What is the main benefit of parameterizing each latent variable? Does it improve diversity?\"\n\nWe list some of the benefits of this approach (for example) at the end of para. 5 on page 1. Our objective is to provide explicit customization of dynamical systems predictions: (i) for simple dynamical systems where no customization is otherwise available, (ii) improving the scope where it is, and avoiding mode drift (sec. 1, para. 2) and (iii) in either case, permitting user control of this customization. For an example of our motivation, consider an animator controlling the style of mocap predictions from an RNN (e.g. a 'depressed' or 'childlike' walking style). Our approach is to learn a latent manifold over the dynamical system _parameters_ which can generate these different styles. This can be viewed as a form of multi-task learning (MTL), treating each sequence as a 'task', and learning different parameter settings for each. We agree that the motivation for MTL can be made a little clearer, we have updated the introduction in our revised version accordingly.\n\n                          ***\n\n2. \"[W]hat is the key idea that the proposed model can generate diverse sequences compare to other generative models (e.g., GAN or VAE-based models).\"\n\nOur work here pertains to arbitrary-length sequences (such as in the time series context) rather than fixed-length sequences. Hence standard VAE- and GAN-based architectures are inappropriate. In contrast to generative autoregressive models such as NADE (Larochelle et al., 2011), and more recent forms such as PixelRNN (van den Oord et al., 2016), the key idea is that we can _control_ the style of the generation via a latent variable. Generative (dynamical) models which utilize ideas from VAE- and GAN-based architectures are given in the related work (section 3).\n\n                          ***\n\n3. \"The authors claim that the proposed approach provides grater data efficiency. How is it compare to other generative models?\"\n\nGiven our discussion of generative models above, two sensible comparisons will be to (i) a 'generative' RNN (generative in the same sense of e.g. a PixelRNN) and (ii) a recent VAE-based architecture given in Miladinovi\u0107 et al. (2019). A comparison to (i) is given by the 'Pooled-GRU' model -- where all the 'tasks' in the training set are pooled together. In response to your question, and also to R3, we have run the experiments for (ii), which are now available in our updated manuscript. In particular see the Mocap experiments (sec 4.2, 'MTBias' model) especially Figure 3(a).\n\n                          ***\n\n4. \"Overall, it is not clear the benefit of the proposed model over existing algorithms. This paper needs to provide comparisons with any other existing models, especially on Mocap data.\"\n\nThe pooled-GRU model which serves as our benchmark is due to Martinez et al. (2017), which is approximately state of the art for this problem. Our contribution is to show that we can provide fine-grained control of the customization (see style transfer task and animations), and also that this produces better quantitative results in smaller data regimes and under dataset shift, for which our experiments provide strong evidence. As noted above, we also now provide a comparison with the most similar recent work to ours (Miladinovi\u0107 et al.) which further supports our claim. We have also tightened up the introduction to make the benefits more clear.\n\n                          ***\n\n5. \"What are the differences between pooled models and single-task models?\"\n\nSee sec. 4.1 (Model) and sec. 4.2 (Experiment 1). As we state in the introduction, sequence data often consists of multiple similar tasks mixed together (e.g. walking styles in mocap data). A pooled model thus ignores the distinction between the multiple tasks and learns a single model for the entire collection. A single-task (ST) model learns from data associated only with a single task (e.g. learns only from one walking style in the mocap data) and hence a much smaller training set. One can think of MTL as finding the 'sweet spot' in between these extremes. A minor clarification has been made in sec. 4.2 for ST models in view of this question.\n\n                          ***\n\nReferences:\n* Larochelle et al.

I believe. U^{-1} x could be of this form, but not necessarily x\"\n\nTo clarify, our argument is that any LDS distribution over the $y_{1:T}$ may be obtained using the restricted parameterization of eq. (6). We are careful not to claim that eq. (4) is equivalent to eq. (6) in isolation. We have made a slight tweak to the wording in the main text, and an additional note in the supp. mat. to emphasise this point. \n\nAs to the relationship between the state variables, the $x_{1:T}$ of eq. (6) are indeed obtained via the transformation $U^{-1}$ of the state variables in eq. (4), with $U$ the matrix of left singular vectors of $A$. ($B$ and $b$ must also be transformed similarly, cf. eq. (14).) Replacing $A$ in eq. (4) simply by a diagonal matrix is certainly a restriction; specifically it excludes any oscillations in the latent state, and hence in observation space. We note in passing that this reduced parameterization (diagonal*orthogonal) was crucial in practice to stabilize the learning of the MTLDS.\n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n> (sec 2.3, inference): \"the estimation of the posterior using your method of AIS with MoG seem quite involved... What happened for simpler methods?\" \n\nWe provide a wide-ranging discussion of inference techniques in supp. mat. A.1.4-A.1.5 which argues that there are relatively few inference approaches that can be used for this problem. An HMC/Langevin-MCMC approach will require a large number of (serial) gradient evaluations via BPTT, and hence will be very slow, but can utilize existing tools (e.g. Stan, Pyro). Using AdaIS with a simple Gaussian proposal will suffer in higher dimensions and/or for multi-modal or highly non-Gaussian posteriors, leading to reduced performance. The MoG variation adds relatively little complexity both conceptually, and in run-time (since run-time is dominated by forward simulation), and hence is more generally useful than a simple Gaussian proposal. Furthermore (as noted in p17, bottom), we observed highly non-Gaussian posteriors for small $t$ even in the MTLDS experiments.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper796/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper796/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["abird@turing.ac.uk", "ckiw@inf.ed.ac.uk"], "title": "Customizing Sequence Generation with Multi-Task Dynamical Systems", "authors": ["Alex Bird", "Christopher K.

Another strength of the model is flexibility as different base models and latent models can be chosen. In experiments, it can achieve reasonable performance using hierarchical RNN as a base model and VAE for latent modeling. \n+ The new formulation is well-explained in the thorough appendix.\n\n\n<Weakness>\nIn my opinion, the major weakness of this paper is weak experiments, although many results of different types of tests are reported. \n\n1. The experiments are carried out with a simple toy dataset DHO and MOCAP data. As done in previous related papers, some challenging video datasets can be used for more convincing evaluation.\n\n2. The compared baseline models are too weak, given that no state-of-the-art model is compared. \n- Throughout the papers, only single-task version and pooped version of the model are compared. It may not be surprising that the multi-task version is better than these two weak baselines. \n -In section 3, several latent sequential models are introduced, including Miladinovic et al. (2019),  Hsu et al. (2017), Yingzhen & Mandt (2018), Bird et al. (2019). I strongly recommend a couple of them may need to be implemented and investigated in some sets of experiments.\n\n<Conclusion>\nMy initial rate is borderline with slightly leaning toward accept.

In this paper we show that hierarchical multi-task dynamical systems (MTDSs) provide direct user control over sequence generation, via use of a latent  code z that specifies the customization to the\nindividual data sequence. This enables style transfer, interpolation and morphing within generated sequences. We show the MTDS can improve predictions via latent code interpolation, and avoid the long-term performance degradation of standard RNN approaches.", "code": "https://bitbucket.org/user3036976834/mtds_iclr_codebase/src/master/", "keywords": ["Time-series modelling", "Dynamical systems", "RNNs", "Multi-task learning"], "paperhash": "bird|customizing_sequence_generation_with_multitask_dynamical_systems", "original_pdf": "/attachment/f2de6105e63d1cbc9d7562c86372abae122ad00d.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nbird2020customizing,\ntitle={Customizing Sequence Generation with Multi-Task Dynamical Systems},\nauthor={Alex Bird and Christopher K.
