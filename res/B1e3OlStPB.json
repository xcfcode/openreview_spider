In our opinion, those don't possess full spherical symmetries as gravity is orienting the objects. We encourage the reviewer to check the work of Khasanova and Frossard, who explicitly designed graph-based spherical CNNs for omnidirectional imaging. In [1], they designed a graph that yields an equivariant convolution to a subgroup of SO(3). Longitudinal rotations are equivariant by construction of the equiangular sampling, and they optimized the graph for latitudinal equivariance. Their scheme is presented in section 3.2 of our paper. While their convolution is not equivariant to the whole of SO(3), that is not an issue for this application as gravity prevents objects from rotating around the third axis. It may even be beneficial. Moreover, the orientation given by gravity allows to factorize the spherical graph and design anisotropic filters [2].\n\nRadius or kNN graphs are means to get a sparse graph for O(n) matrix multiplication, instead of O(n\u00b2) for the full distance-based similarity graph. We believe that the choice of one or the other doesn't really matter. Sparsification can be seen as a numerical approximation that replaces small values by zeros. The kNN scheme is often preferred in practice as the choice of k is directly linked to the computational cost, while the choice of a radius large enough to avoid disconnected vertices might include many more edges than necessary on denser areas.\n\nThanks for pointing out an unclear statement about the dispersion of the sampling sequence. d_i should be understood as the largest distance between the center x_i and any point on the surface sigma_i. Hence, we define d_i to be the radius of the smallest ball centered at x_i containing sigma_i. We'll clarify.\n\nFrom the following two sentences, we don't understand what could be improved.\n* \"The theoretical analysis and discussion of sampling is interesting, though should be more clearly stated throughout and potentially visualized in figures.\"\n* \"A figure detailing the parameters and setup for theorem 3.1 and figure 2 would be useful.\"\nWe would be glad if the reviewer could elaborate.\n\nA revised manuscript will be uploaded shortly.\n\n[1] Renata Khasanova and Pascal Frossard.

The primary goal is to develop a method that encodes equivariance to rotations, cheaply. The graph is formed by sampling the surface of the sphere and connecting neighbors according to a distance-based similarity measure. The equivariance of the representation is demonstrated empirically and theoretical background on its convergence properties are shown. DeepSphere is then demonstrated on several problems as well as shown how it applies to non-uniform data.\n\nThe paper is interesting and clear. The projection of structured data to graphical representations is both efficient in utilizing existing algorithmic techniques for graph convolutions and useful for approaching the spherical structure of the data. The theoretical analysis and discussion of sampling is interesting, though should be more clearly stated throughout and potentially visualized in figures.\n\nThe experiments performed are thorough and interesting. The approach both outperforms baselines in inference time and accuracy. However, one wonders the performance on the well-researched tasks such as the performance on 3D imagery, e.g., Su & Grauman, 2017; Coors et al., 2018. \n\nThe unevenly sampled data is a nice extension showing the generality of the approach. How does the approach work for data connected within a radius rather than a k-nearest approach?\n\nMinor:\n- A figure detailing the parameters and setup for theorem 3.1 and figure 2 would be useful.\n- The statement on the dispersion of the sampling sequence states \u201cthe smallest ball in \\R^3 containing \\sigma_i\u201d, but I believe it should be \u201ccontaining only \\sigma_i\u201d."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2413/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2413/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["michael.defferrard@epfl.ch", "martino.milani@epfl.ch", "frederick.gusset@epfl.ch", "nathanael.perraudin@sdsc.ethz.ch"], "title": "DeepSphere: a graph-based spherical CNN", "authors": ["Micha\u00ebl Defferrard", "Martino Milani", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Gusset", "Nathana\u00ebl Perraudin"], "pdf": "/pdf/4062fbb4d40a4cef410b9b9b99e84e62ade36d63.pdf", "TL;DR": "A graph-based spherical CNN that strikes an interesting balance of trade-offs for a wide variety of applications.", "abstract": "Designing a convolution for a spherical neural network requires a delicate tradeoff between efficiency and rotation equivariance. DeepSphere, a method based on a graph representation of the discretized sphere, strikes a controllable balance between these two desiderata. This contribution is twofold. First, we study both theoretically and empirically how equivariance is affected by the underlying graph with respect to the number of pixels and neighbors. Second, we evaluate DeepSphere on relevant problems. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates the efficiency and flexibility of this formulation. Perhaps surprisingly, comparison with previous work suggests that anisotropic filters might be an unnecessary price to pay.
