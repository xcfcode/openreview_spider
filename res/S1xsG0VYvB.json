The object classification task is not really relevant to elicit the observed behavior and 2. Inhibitory neurons are not essential (at least when training with batch norm). \n\nDo the conclusions of the paper about understanding of E/I cells in the brain still hold? I am not really sure. I would like to urge the authors to carefully assess their conclusions again in light of the new evidence and perhaps rephrase abstract, intro and discussion where necessary.\n\nHaving said that, I still like the paper and its approach. I think it provides valuable insights to the field (e.g. neuro-inspired architecture design, concerns regarding training objectives, etc.) and important steps in the right direction and could be a valuable contribution even if the original claims are not entirely substantiated.\n\n\n[Original review]\n\nThis paper seeks to understand why excitatory neurons in cortex are more stimulus selective than inhibitory cells and why excitatory cells are more sparsely connected to each other. The authors train a recurrent neural network model with a number of biological constraints on CIFAR-10. These constraints include Dale's law, an unequal number of E vs. I cells and only excitatory connections between layers (areas) of the network. I would summarize the main findings as follows:\n\n- Excitatory principal neurons are more selective and more sparsely connected to each other than local inhibitory neurons, consistent with biology\n\n- Stimulus selectivity and performance depend only on the number of excitatory cells, but neither on the E/I ratio nor the number of I cells\n\n- High selectivity appears to be a general property of principal cells, but does not depend on the sign of local connections, while sparse connectivity is mainly linked to the excitatory local connections\n\n\nStrengths:\n+ Architectural decisions are well motivated from a neuroscientific perspective\n+ Provides a hypothesis why certain connectivity and selectivity patterns emerge in the brain by incorporating biological knowledge into neural network models trained on a specific task\n+ Well written and clear, logic development of the arguments\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Unclear whether classification task is necessary to elicit the authors' observations\n- Interneurons seem unnecessary, raising concerns about relevance of results\n- Also trains on ImageNet, but only some results are shown; most from CIFAR\n\n\nOverall I like the paper from the perspective of a neuroscientist, as it provides a kind of normative account of why things in the brain might look the way they do. My enthusiasm is somewhat limited, however, because I am not convinced the classification task is actually what drives the authors' observations. I am willing to increase my score and argue more strongly for the paper if the authors can address this concern, detailed in the following:\n\nA few observations lead me to believe the classification task the networks are trained may not be important to elicit the observed behavior. \n\n1.) The emergent properties in stimulus selectivity show up almost immediately after training starts according to Fig. 5A+B. Performance, on the other hand, takes a few more epochs to pick up according to Fig. 10. \n\n2.) The connectivity preferences that emerge in Figure 5C appear at already 50 epochs where CIFAR-10 performance is at 50%. To put that into perspective, a linear SVM already achieves 40% on this task, and a one-layer multilayer perceptron with only 100 hidden neurons reaches that performance. \n\n3.) The results of Fig. 11 suggest that the number of inhibitory channels is not important. Did the authors try a stripped down version with only excitatory cells?\n\nI suggest the authors train on CIFAR-10 with shuffled labels on the training set [Zhang et al. 2016; https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530]. Although performance on the test set would be at chance (no object recognition capabilities), it would be interesting to see whether the selectivity and connectivity properties still emerge.\n\nFinally, (related to 3.) I wonder whether it makes sense to draw conclusions about differences between E and I cells from a model trained on a task where the number of inhibitory cells seems irrelevant. Wouldn't one need to have at least both types of neurons to be required for the task in order to draw such conclusions?\n\n\nMinor Comments:\n\n- I sometimes found the nomenclature of the multiple models you tried a bit confusing and hard to follow \u2014 especially in parts of the Appendix\n\n- The type of operations (convolution, element-wise) in equation 1, together with the meaning of nonlinearities like \\sigma_c are only defined one page after, making that section a bit hard to follow.

We have run multiple preliminary experiments that hopefully address the reviewer\u2019s concerns. We included these preliminary results in two new supplementary figures (Figure 16, 17) and sections (Appendix J, K). Given the short amount of time available for rebuttal, these figures are far from publication quality yet. We will continue to improve them.\n\n1. On whether the classification task is important. \nThe reviewer made an astute observation about the earlier rise of orientation and image skewness compared to classification performance. To draw attention to this phenomenon, we have edited the manuscript text. This phenomenon can have at least two causes. One possibility is that the rise of skewness is unrelated to classification per se. Another possibility is that the rise of skewness is necessary for subsequent improvement in classification accuracy.\n\nTo test these hypotheses, as suggested by the reviewer, we trained networks on CIFAR-10 with shuffled labels closely following the method of Zhang et al. 2016 (Appendix J, Figure 16). Our Standard network for CIFAR10 contains 107K trainable parameters, compared to ~1.6M parameters in networks used by Zhang et al. 2016, therefore we used shuffled training sets 10X smaller than the original training set. Unlike Zhang et al. 2016, networks trained to fit random labels did not have regularizations turned off. If we turn off L2 regularization on weights, then connection probability of excitatory and inhibitory neurons approach 1, similar to observed before (see Appendix A).\n\nAfter training, networks can achieve high accuracy on the training set (but not on the validation set, as expected). Higher selectivity and sparser connectivity among excitatory neurons still emerge in such networks (Figure 16), although less consistently across areas or random seeds. Understanding the minimal task necessary for the emergence of E-I differences would be interesting for future work. We have added a Results section to show this finding.\n\n2. On whether inhibitory neurons are necessary.\nThe reviewer made another excellent observation that the classification accuracy appears to depend very weakly on the number of inhibitory channels. As suggested by the reviewer, we trained the Standard and StandardEI networks with no inhibitory channels (Appendix K, Figure 17). To our surprise, the accuracy dropped, but rather moderately (Standard, 0.855 \u2014> 0.817; StandardEI, 0.842 \u2014> 0.728). We sought to understand what compensated for the loss of inhibitory neurons. We found that without Batch Normalization (BN) on excitatory neurons, the loss of inhibitory neurons becomes devastating, reducing the performance to chance level (Standard, 0.837 \u2014> 0.107; StandardEI, 0.711 \u2014> 0.122). Therefore, inhibitory neurons are particularly necessary in networks trained without BN.\n\nTo ensure that the main findings are independent of whether batch normalization is applied, we repeated our experiments of Figs. 6 and 7, but for Standard and StandardEI architectures with no BN. We were able to reproduce all major findings summarized by the reviewer.\n\nWe did notice that even though having 0 inhibitory neurons is devastating, the accuracy can be rescued by having a single inhibitory channel (Figure 17c), which in a convolutional network corresponds to many inhibitory neurons with the same tuning. This is consistent with experimental findings that inhibitory neurons are weakly or non-selective.\n\nWe would also like to point out that, even with BN applied, inhibitory neurons are active and strongly connected with excitatory neurons, meaning that they participate in the proper functioning of the network.\n\nTo summarize, inhibitory neurons are always used, but only indispensable when BN is not applied. The main conclusions of the paper hold with or without BN. These new results are included in the updated manuscript and Figures.\n\n3. On the results from ImageNet\nWe did not run the same numbers of experiments as we did for CIFAR10, but we will include a summary figure in the same style as Figure 7 for networks trained on ImageNet.\n\n4. On confusing nomenclature and explanation of Eq. 1\nWe will update the figures with hopefully clearer names, including the ones in the Appendix. We will also update the manuscript to clarify the section of Eq. 1.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sunminni1031@gmail.com", "jian.li.acad@gmail.com", "thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "gracewlindsay@gmail.com", "kendmiller@gmail.com", "mario.dipoppa@gmail.com", "gyyang.neuro@gmail.com"], "title": "Understanding the functional and structural differences across excitatory and inhibitory neurons", "authors": ["Sun Minni", "Li Ji-An", "Theodore Moskovitz", "Grace Lindsay", "Kenneth Miller", "Mario Dipoppa", "Guangyu Robert Yang"], "pdf": "/pdf/f661284e01ac9fe714cabc1c1e8e0a4089a5cca7.pdf", "TL;DR": "Deep nets with excitatory and inhibitory neurons developed functional and structural differences similar to the brain, and here's why.", "abstract": "One of the most fundamental organizational principles of the brain is the separation of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons.

The authors attempt to emulate real-life human brain neural network structure with artificial neural networks similar in architecture to the visual cortex.\nThe authors claim that they observe similar patterns emerge in the Neural Networks when it comes to the interaction and topological properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.\n\nUnfortunately, the paper's claims seems to be undermined by several factors. First, the properties of the artificial neural networks that the authors build into the model (excitatory/inhibitory neurons relative abundance, inter-layer projection) are likely to be sufficient to explain the properties authors claim are informative in their model.\n\nIn addition to that, some architectural choices by the authors are highly disputable and counter-intuitive. For instance ReLU activation for Neurons would be contradicting any biological reality.\n\nBesides, to be biologically innovative, the authors' approach seems to miss a number of crucial factors - notably interaction between neurotransmitters, timing of discharges and synapses offsets, allowing single neurons to perform complex logical computations requiring artificial neural networks with simple scalar non-linear activation functions multi-layer sub-networks to learn.\n\nThe case the authors cite - similarity of architectures of convolutional neural networks and the pinwheel architecture of visual cortex V1/V2 areas, is one of the few examples of convergent architectures of real-world and artificial neural networks specializing in a task.\n\nFinally, the role of Inhibory neurons in the visual cortex seems to be\nwell understood, both biologically and mathematically (see for instance https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627303003325 or https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627303003325 or https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092842570300072X)\n\nOverall, the quality of the article at least in its current state, does not seem to be ready for acceptance to ICLR, but I'm willing to adjust my opinion after reading the opinion of more qualified reviewers' in this area and the authors response.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sunminni1031@gmail.com", "jian.li.acad@gmail.com", "thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "gracewlindsay@gmail.com", "kendmiller@gmail.com", "mario.dipoppa@gmail.com", "gyyang.neuro@gmail.com"], "title": "Understanding the functional and structural differences across excitatory and inhibitory neurons", "authors": ["Sun Minni", "Li Ji-An", "Theodore Moskovitz", "Grace Lindsay", "Kenneth Miller", "Mario Dipoppa", "Guangyu Robert Yang"], "pdf": "/pdf/f661284e01ac9fe714cabc1c1e8e0a4089a5cca7.pdf", "TL;DR": "Deep nets with excitatory and inhibitory neurons developed functional and structural differences similar to the brain, and here's why.", "abstract": "One of the most fundamental organizational principles of the brain is the separation of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons.

On architectural choices\nWe thank reviewer #2 for noting the tradeoff between biological fidelity and network performance. We believe our architectural choices are reasonable (for example, reviewer #1 notes that  \u201cArchitectural decisions are well motivated from a neuroscientific perspective\u201d), and are close to that of other papers recently published at ICLR and similar conferences. We detail our reasoning below. We have edited our Results section, and included a new Appendix section to discuss the architectural choices.\n\n2.1 ReLU activation function\nBesides being one of the standard choices of activation function for deep convolutional neural networks since around 2011 [Glorot, Bordes, Bengio 2011, Nair & Hinton 2010, He, Zhang, Ren, Sun 2016], ReLU and its close variants (ELU, LeakyReLU, etc.) are widely used in deep neural network models for visual neuroscience (many of them being the same models used in computer vision) [Rajalingham, Issa, DiCarlo et al. 2018 JNeuroSci, Cadieu, DiCarlo et al. 2014 PlosComBio, Sinz, Tolias et al. 2018 NeurIPS, Nayebi, Bear, Yamins, et al. 2018 NeurIPS, Lindsey, Ocko, Ganguli, Deny 2019 ICLR].\n\nAdmittedly, the ReLU activation function is not an accurate depiction of a biological f-I curve, however, it does capture the important rectification of activity at low input values. ReLU does not saturate at high input values, while neurons obviously do (>200 sp/s). However, most cortical neurons do not operate in this high-activity saturating regime. Many rate-based computational models of neural circuits use activation functions that do not saturate at high values [e.g., Wong & Wang 2006 JNeuroSci, Rubin, Van Hooser, Miller 2015 Neuron].\n\n2.2 More complex single neuron and synapse model\nThe reviewer cites a number of biological factors not included in our model, including \u201cinteraction between neurotransmitters\u201d, \u201ctiming of discharges\u201d, and single neurons that \u201cperform complex logical computations\u201d.\n\nAs mentioned above, our work aims at exploring the necessary computational conditions for several experimentally-observed properties to emerge. It is, in fact, another important implication of our work that the biological features mentioned above are not required for such emergent properties. Rather than attempting to implement all biologically-relevant network features in our models, we include features that represent a step forward in biologically fidelity relative to most deep networks (e.g., excitatory and inhibitory neurons), but which are still feasible to implement on high-dimensional visual classification tasks. It is an interesting challenge for future work to further incorporate biological components, including those mentioned above, into deep neural networks. We have included this discussion in the Discussion section.\n\n\n3. On Pinwheel and the role of inhibitory neurons\n\u201cThe case the authors cite - similarity of architectures of convolutional neural networks and the pinwheel architecture of visual cortex V1/V2 areas\u201d. However, we would like to note that we did not mention pinwheels in our manuscript. In fact, convolutional neural networks can not develop pinwheel structures because of the convolutions, meaning that neurons selective to one direction would be located at all spatial locations.\n\nThe reviewer mentioned that \u201cThe role of Inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex seems to be\nwell understood\u201d, and cites two papers published in 2003 (2 of the 3 references cited by the reviewer are the same). We respectfully disagree with this assessment. The continued progress in our understanding of the role of inhibitory neurons, especially different types of inhibitory neurons, is evidenced by many high-profile publications studying them in the visual cortex published long after 2003 [e.g., Adesnik, Scanziani, et al. 2012 Nature, Atallah, Scanziani et al. 2012 Neuron, Fu, Stryker et al. 2014 Cell]. Nevertheless, in the Introduction, we now better acknowledge the classical literature on the functional role of inhibitory neurons by including more references from authors like David McLaughlin and Bob Shapley.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sunminni1031@gmail.com", "jian.li.acad@gmail.com", "thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "gracewlindsay@gmail.com", "kendmiller@gmail.com", "mario.dipoppa@gmail.com", "gyyang.neuro@gmail.com"], "title": "Understanding the functional and structural differences across excitatory and inhibitory neurons", "authors": ["Sun Minni", "Li Ji-An", "Theodore Moskovitz", "Grace Lindsay", "Kenneth Miller", "Mario Dipoppa", "Guangyu Robert Yang"], "pdf": "/pdf/f661284e01ac9fe714cabc1c1e8e0a4089a5cca7.pdf", "TL;DR": "Deep nets with excitatory and inhibitory neurons developed functional and structural differences similar to the brain, and here's why.", "abstract": "One of the most fundamental organizational principles of the brain is the separation of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons.

On the motivation of this work\nWe thank the reviewer for observing that  \u201cthe properties...build into the model...are likely to be sufficient to explain the properties authors claim are informative in their model.\u201d  This is indeed exactly what we are attempting to demonstrate. Our results show that the built-in properties (abundance of E neurons, excitatory long-range projections) are sufficient to explain the emergence of other biologically-realistic properties (sparser E-E connections, more selective E neurons) not present at initialization. Training is required for the built-in properties to foster the development of these emergent properties. This can be seen in Figure 5, where there is no difference between selectivity and connectivity of E and I neurons at the beginning of training.\n\nOne of our goals is to find precisely what the reviewer references: the minimal set of network characteristics that are required to produce biologically-realistic connectivity and selectivity through training. This is why we systematically trained different variants of the original model (Fig. 6, 7). We edited our Introduction section to clarify these points.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1012/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["sunminni1031@gmail.com", "jian.li.acad@gmail.com", "thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "gracewlindsay@gmail.com", "kendmiller@gmail.com", "mario.dipoppa@gmail.com", "gyyang.neuro@gmail.com"], "title": "Understanding the functional and structural differences across excitatory and inhibitory neurons", "authors": ["Sun Minni", "Li Ji-An", "Theodore Moskovitz", "Grace Lindsay", "Kenneth Miller", "Mario Dipoppa", "Guangyu Robert Yang"], "pdf": "/pdf/f661284e01ac9fe714cabc1c1e8e0a4089a5cca7.pdf", "TL;DR": "Deep nets with excitatory and inhibitory neurons developed functional and structural differences similar to the brain, and here's why.", "abstract": "One of the most fundamental organizational principles of the brain is the separation of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons.
