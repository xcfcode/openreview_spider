[1] show that this correlation is highly dependent on the max. drop path probability value used during the one-shot model train. But there where 2 recent papers [2, 3] that show that this correlation is actually low, and it a high value of that might be due to some intrinsic properties of the search spaces. Therefore, I believe that the method proposed might not scale to other space designs.\n\nFurthermore, I think that it is possible to compare apples-to-apples. There are certain benchmark papers doing this such as NAS-Bench-101 [4], NAS-Bench-1Shot1 [3], AA-NAS-Bench [5] or \"NAS evaluation is frustratingly hard\" [6]. Therefore I would say that running the proposed algorithm in the standard DARTS search space would be useful to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method alone, when compared to DARTS.\n\nI thank again the authors for their response and for taking into account the points I listed. However, I still would lean to a weak reject. I would recommend a more careful analysis to assess the sensitivity of their proposed method, and a more careful head-to-head comparison with other one-shot NAS algorithms using the same settings.\n\n-- References --\n[1] Gabriel Bender, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Quoc Le.

Below we provide our responses to your concerns. \n\nQ1: \nWe agree that the measurements from the stand-alone architecture and from the one-shot model must be strongly correlated if the performance estimation strategy is to succeed. However, we would like to point out that the one-shot model has been addressed multiple times in the NAS literature already. Bender et al. have studied this before: see Figure 5 in [1] for concrete support of this fact, showing strong monotonic correlation between the performance of a one-shot model trained with weight-sharing and a stand-alone model. \n\nMoreover, Random Search with weight sharing [2] simplifies the training procedure of the one-shot model from [1] omitting the complex stabilization techniques adopted in [1] such as ScheduledDropPath and ghost batch normalization, while achieving competitive results to existing methods. Our methodology follows the training algorithm from [2], and hence does not require the ScheduledDropPath probability hyperparameter. (See also Section 3 from [2].)  We specifically chose $p=0.5$ to train the one-shot model such that the one-shot model was optimized for the sub-network sampled from $\\alpha ~ \\{-1, 1\\}^n$ under uniformly chosen random tuples. \n\n\nQ2: We thank the reviewer for raising this question. In the revision, we will clarify that the CoNAS performance improvement may come from both the search space and the search method, but we explain below that ultimately the final metric should be running time for a given accuracy.\n\nWe agree that apples-to-apples comparisons of NAS approaches are difficult due to the existence of several hyperparameters influencing the final performance: various data augmentation techniques (including cutout [3] and auto-augment [4]), training epochs, learning rate decay methods ([5]), regularizing hyperparameters, label-smoothing, and others. Therefore, we have focused on comparing CoNAS with DARTs as a baseline.\n\nWe agree that using 7 operations (8 operations, but with a zero operation) would enable a better one-to-one comparison to DARTs; however, we have observed from our experiments that the difference of operation sets between 5 ops and 7 ops is not a limiting factor.\n\nTable 1 shows that CoNAS outperforms not only with the experimental results for DARTs reported in [6] and [2], but also DARTs with 5 operations (6 operations, but zero operation). Moreover, the number of possible architectures ($\\binom{140}{16} \\approx 4.3 * 10^{20}$) from CoNAS far exceeds the search space of DARTs with 5ops ($5.0*10^{15}$, $7ops: 10^{18}$). Since CoNAS found the best architecture with less amount of search time even with the much larger search space, we infer that our improvements mainly arise due to the search method. \n\nMoreover, we would like to point out the performance of ENAS [7] taken from Table 1 from Liu et al. also uses 5 operations (6 ops including zero-ops), and achieve 2.91% test error with DARTs\u2019 final training protocol, whereas CoNAS achieved 2.57% test error with significantly smaller parameter size (3.3M vs 2.3M).\n\n\nQ3: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have included the proof of Theorem 3.2 in the paper and some discussion in appendix A.2.\n\n\nQ4: We gratefully thank the reviewer for suggesting this structure of the paper. We have reorganized the paper accordingly to compress the main paper within 9 pages.\n\n\nAgain, we appreciate your time and efforts looking into our paper.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] Gabriel Bender, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Quoc Le.

We've added corrections and clarifications regards to your concern on our paper. \n\nQ1: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In the submitted version, we had provided some discussion regarding the upper bound of the number of rows for the graph-sampling matrix A to satisfy RIP. We have clarified the proof right after Theorem 3.2 in the paper. \n\n\nQ2: We agree that the improvement of test error is not significantly different than the current state-of-the-art. However, we respectfully push back against the criticisms of lack of improvement. The criteria for evaluating algorithm performance in NAS involves not only the test error, but also the search time, model size, and number of FLOPs. \n\nThe seminal work of NAS starts from Zoph et al. [1] suggests the method of automatically designing the competitive architectures (test error: 2.65%, model size: 3.3M on CIFAR-10), but required substantial computational resources (2000 GPU days). Numerous later works have been introduced to reduce the search time, but the test error performance has remained comparable to [1]. These are summarized in this table:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n|Method     |Test Error(%)   |Search Time (Days/GPU)|Model Size (M)|\n|NASNET[1]|2.65%               |2000                                  |3.3                   |\n|ENAS  [2]   |2.89%               |0.45                                   |4.6                   |\n|DARTS [3]  |2.76 \\pm 0.09  |4                                        |3.3                   |\n|SNAS  [4]   |2.85 \\pm 0.02  |1.5                                     |3.3                   |\n|RSWS  [5]  |2.85 \\pm 0.08  |2.7                                     |3.7                   |\n|GHN   [6]   |2.84 \\pm 0.07  |0.84                                   |5.7                  |\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would like to highlight that a perfectly fair comparison between the performance of NAS algorithms are currently very challenging since various hyperparameters are involved in the training protocol for the final evaluation: cutout [7], auto-augment [8]), training epochs, learning rate decay methods ([9]). We refer to Table 1, which shows CoNAS breaks the 2% barrier of test error on CIFAR-10 with auto-augment. \n\nOur focus, therefore, has been to show the impact of a better search strategy (Fourier sparse recovery) while keeping other factors as similar as possible. The hyperparameter setup (training protocol for the final evaluation) of CoNAS is exactly the same as that of DARTs, but we demonstrate that CoNAS achieves a (small) improvement in test error but given smaller model size, lesser number of FLOPs, and  significantly reduced search time.\n\n\nQ3: The main idea of our algorithm is to represent the one-shot model (f) with its Boolean expansion; note that this trick works for any $f$ that is a black-box function. We note that the vanilla search strategy with one-shot architecture randomly samples the architectures and pick the best one with the smallest loss (random search), while the objective of our method is to express $f$ in terms of the polynomial basis functions ($g$).\n\nWe would like to point out that CoNAS achieved better performance than random search with weight-sharing [5] while the search time of CoNAS is much shorter than [5]: 0.4 Day/GPU for our method and 2.7 Day/GPU for [5] (the longer search time allows to sample more architecture.\n\n\nMinor concern: We gratefully thank the reviewer for pointing out the error in Equation 3.1. In the graph-sampling matrix A, the row corresponds to the measurement while the columns correspond to the Fourier basis. We have fixed the expression accordingly.\n\nAgain, we thank your time and effort for reviewing our paper.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Jonathon Shlens, Quoc V. Le.

We have added the clarification regard to your concerns on our paper in below.\n\nQ1: We gratefully thank the reviewer for suggesting the structure of the paper. We have reorganized the paper accordingly to compress the main paper in 9 pages. \n\n\nQ2: We agree with the reviewer that Boolean function expansion using Fourier methods is a classical trick, used by multiple papers in the ML literature (e.g., Stobbe et al. [1], Kocaoglu et al. [2]) that predate the Harmonica work. \n\nWe also agree that CoNAS follows the same path as Harmonica. As we explain in detail in Section 5, NAS and hyper-parameter optimization are both meta-learning problems, but the two bodies of literature in these two sub-fields of meta-learning have been largely disjoint. \n\nBut beyond this, CoNAS also is different from Harmonica in two other important ways. Our measurements are gathered in a much more efficient manner (see Appendix A.1) leading to an improvement of nearly 4 orders of magnitude over the naive random sampling approach adopted by Harmonica, and our algorithm does not require invocation of a baseline HPO scheme like random search, successive halving, or Hyperband.\n\n\nQ3: We appreciate the reviewer for raising this point. As our paper mainly focuses on comparing our algorithm to DARTs with the fair comparison, we respectfully claim that the main factor of performance improvements comes from our search strategy.\n\nOur search space is a generalized version of proposed in DARTs [3] with larger capacity of possible architecture candidates. In other words, our search space is a superset of DARTs\u2019 search space. Given an equivalent number of edges activated, the number of possible architectures from CoNAS is $\\binom{140}{16} \\approx 4.3 * 10^{20}$, while DARTs search space has approximately $10^{18}$ architecture candidates. The actual number of candidate architecture can in fact be larger than $4.3 * 10^{20}$ since the number of activated edges can vary depending on the solution of the sparse recovery step.\n\nThe NAS survey paper [4] shows that reducing the size of the search space by incorporating human prior knowledge may accelerate the search time; however, this prevents finding novel architecture beyond the current human knowledge due to the introduction of human bias. We would like to point out that our search algorithm finds a winning architecture with smaller search time than [3] (0.4 days vs 4 days) while the search space is larger than that of [3].\n\n\nQ4: In our experiments, the values of different parameters are set to d=2, s=10, n =140. According to the bound provided in Theorem 3.2 for the number of rows of matrix A (i.e.,  m = O(s d log^2 s log n)), choosing m=100 will be consistent with these set of parameters. We have also explained this in the proof of Theorem 3.2.\n\n\nAgain, we appreciate your time and effort looking into our paper.\n\nReferences\n[1] Peter Stobbe, Adreas Krause.

As such, this work is an application of recent progress in the field of compressive sensing to One-shot neural architecture search. Given the problem formalism, the authors have also provides guarantee for the optimality of their method, i.e the method can recover the optimal sub-network of any given  a sufficient number of performance measurements.\n\nClarity\nOverall, the paper is well motivated and the technical content is good. That said the structure could be enormously  improved to ease the reading and the overall understanding. For example: better caption for Figure 2 explaining what is shown; presenting the pseudo-code directly in the method overview and spending the rest of the section explaining the method; showing the related work before the experiments; etc.\n\nNovelty\nThe main novelty in my opinion is the application of compressive sensing methods to One-shot NAS. This approach is significantly different from other One-shot NAS method that I am aware of mainly regarding the search strategy employed to find the best architecture. \nHowever, this work seems like an incremental improvement over Hazan et al 2018. To this regard, the only novelty that was the framing of One-shot NAS as a recovery of boolean functions from their sparse Fourier expansions is not new either.  That is said, I am open to be proven wrong on this point!\n\nResults\nThe experiment section is not self-content, the readers is refered a couple of times to other papers to get details that are  critical to reproducibility and understanding. \nOverall, the search strategy of CoNAS seems  parameter efficient, fast and competitive. Also, small ablation studies showing the effect of the different parameters of CoNAS were very informative and well-appreciated.\nHowever,  the search space is different between CoNAS and the others methods for some experiments, making it difficult to decide if the search strategy of CoNAS is definitely competitive compared to other methods or not.\n\nPoints of improvement:\n1 - Structure of the paper\n2 - Clarify novelty compared to HARMONICA ( not the application domain please)\n3 - demonstrate that with the same search space your method is competitive.\n4 - Does m=1000 in your experiments satisfies theorem 3.2? What is the value of d in your experiments? Can you provide supporting experiments that answer those questions?\n\nPreliminary decision:\nFor now, I will say *weak reject* \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1050/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1050/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "One-Shot Neural Architecture Search via Compressive Sensing", "authors": ["Minsu Cho", "Mohammadreza Soltani", "Chinmay Hegde"], "authorids": ["chomd90@iastate.edu", "mohammadreza.soltani@duke.edu", "chinmay@iastate.edu"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "autoML", "neural architecture search", "image classification", "language modeling"], "TL;DR": "A new approach for one-shot neural architecture search that blends in techniques from Fourier-sparse recovery.", "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS), or automated design of neural network models, remains a very challenging meta-learning problem.

The authors propose a new search strategy, as well as a slightly different search space compared to DARTS [1], ProxylessNAS [2], etc. They use architecture samples from the one-shot model evaluated with the search parameters as a surrogate of the true objective in order to speed-up the search. Afterwards, these surrogate function evaluations are used to compute Fourier coefficients which are eventually used to optimize the vector of binary parameters encoding the architecture. \n\nOverall, I think the proposed algorithm is interesting and of practical usefulness. However, in terms of novelty, this work seems more to be an application of Harmonica [6] to the NAS problem (with small modifications in order to make it applicable). In page 10 you state some of the differences of your method with Harmonica. I agree that the number of function evaluations you use (coming from the one-shot model) is larger and computationally less expensive to obtain, however this does not guarantee that these are a good surrogate of the true objective that NAS aims to minimize, i.e. the validation/test accuracy of final (stand-alone) architectures . The empirical evaluations of their algorithm seem to outperform/be competitive compared to other NAS methods on all benchmarks used in the paper, however only DARTS is evaluated on their search space and the other results are taken from the corresponding papers. The paper is well-written and -structured with the caveat of being more than the recommended 8 pages.\n\nI will adjust my score depending on the authors responses concerning the following questions/issues:\n\n1. The correlation between the architectures evaluated using the one-shot weights and retrained from scratch, seems to be of crucial importance in your method, since you directly use the one-shot weights to collect the measurements, similarly to Random Search with weight sharing [3], ENAS [4] or Bender et al. [5]. What is the correlation of these measurements with the stand-alone architectures trained from scratch using the final evaluation settings? How did you tune the p in the Bernoulli distribution during the one-shot weight updates. According to Bender et al. [5] the ScheduledDropPath probability is an important hyperparameter affecting the aforementioned correlation.\n\n2. What is the main motivation for using 5 operations in the operation set and not 8 as in DARTS [1] for example? Does the main contribution in the competitive results come from the different search space or the search method?\n\n3. Is there any reference or proof for the correctness of Theorem 3.2?\n\n4. I think there are some parts that can be moved in the Supplementary, such as the pseudocode for the proposed algorithm or Figure 3, and some other parts that can be compressed, such as the Related Work section.\n\t\nReferences\n[1] Hanxiao Liu, Karen Simonyan, and Yiming Yang.
