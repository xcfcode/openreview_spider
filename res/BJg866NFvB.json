The claim is that the model can decide (i) treatment plan; (ii) optimal time of treatment; and (iii) when to stop treatment. The proposed method attempts to learn time-invariant representations that are not predictive of the next treatment by borrowing ideas from Ganin, et al. (2016)\u2019s work on for domain adversarial training. In fact, this paper is an extension of (Atan et al., 2018) to be applicable for longitudinal data. \n\nThis paper should be rejected due to the following arguments:\n\t- Page 1, par. 4, line 4-7: The example given in sentence \u201cFor instance, if ...\u201d is true regardless of time. Therefore, it does not describe a situation where a time-variant confounder might make causal inference hard. In fact, nowhere in the paper there is a solid description of how time-variant confounders would break the current approaches for causal inference. \n\n\t- Page 3, par. 4, last sentence: I don\u2019t understand why sequential treatments and change of covariates through time can stop us from using the conventional methods for learning balanced representations. Why not consider each time point as an instance (thus representing each patient with multiple instances) and learn the representation from the collection of all these instances?\nAll in all, I don\u2019t understand why the authors assume that the world is non-Markovian and that they have to consider the entire \\bar{H}_t. Especially when in the their Experiments section the model used for tumor growth that generates the synthetic data is Markov, and consequently, does not check if the proposed method works in a non-Markovian world.\nIn summary, if the goal is to solve the non-Markov case, the presented experiments don\u2019t show that the proposed method is addressing that; and if the  goal is to solve the Markov case: (i) why insist on framing the problem as non-Markov; and (ii) (Atan et al., 2018) already have solved this (since we established that there are no time-dependent confounders and as the authors state on page 4, par. 3, line -4 to -3 \u201cthe novelty here comes from the use of domain adversarial training to eliminate bias from the time-dependent confounders\u201d).\n\n\t- Page 6, Theorem 1 and 2 lines above it: This theorem does not prove that the confounding bias is completely removed because the objective function in Eq. (4) being optimized also includes a loss term for outcome prediction. In fact, IF there is a confounding bias (that [partially] determines both treatment and outcome), it would be wrong to remove it from the learned representation.\n\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n\t- Page 2, par. 1, line -2: Use of adverb \u201cMoreover\u201d is wrong. Extreme weights are due to division by small Pr(t|x). The consequence of this numerical instability is high-variance estimates.\n\t- Page 2, par. 4, 1st sentence: incomprehensible\n\t- Page 2, par. 4, line -2: \u201cbut also\u201d should come after a \u201cnot only\u201d.\n\t- Page 3, par. 4, line -1: incorrect usage of citation; both author name(s) and publication year must be in parentheses.\n\t- Page 4, par. 5, last line: sentence \u201cFor testing, the \u2026 \u201c needs elaboration.\n\t- Page 6, par. 1, line -3: \u201cstart of\u201d should be \u201cstart off\u201d.\n\nReferences:\n\t- Atan, O., Zame, W.

We would be happy to perform more experiments that you consider necessary. \n\n\n* Experiments *\n\nRegarding our experimental set-up, please note that the treatment assignments (bottom of page 6 and equation (23) in Appendix F) depend on the mean value of the history of the tumour diameter for the past 15 days. This introduces time-dependent confounding since the history of the tumour diameter (and not just the current value) affects the treatment assignment and subsequently the future outcomes. \n\nIn addition, the chemotherapy drug concentration C(t) follows an exponential decay and depends on the current chemotherapy treatment assignment and past drug concentration (equation (22)). We provide in Appendix F a full description of the tumour growth simulation. \n\nPlease also note that the same data simulation was used to evaluate Recurrent Marginal Structural Networks (Lim et al., NeurIPS 2018) [3] a model that uses the inverse probability of treatment weighting to handle the time-dependent confounders and estimate patient outcomes. \n\n\n* Additional experimental results *\n\nTo further improve the experiments and illustrate the applicability of the Counterfactual Recurrent Network in more complex scenarios involving real data, we also performed experiments using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database consisting of electronic health records from patients in the ICU. \n\nFrom MIMIC III we extracted a dataset of 3487 patients on antibiotics (treatments). For each patient, we extracted 25 patient covariates including laboratory tests and vital signs measured over time, as well as static patient features such as age and gender. We modelled the antibiotics as binary treatments indicating whether the patient has received antibiotics or not at each timestep. \n\nWe train the Counterfactual Recurrent Network (CRN) and Recurrent Marginal Structural Networks (RMSNs) models to estimate the effect of the antibiotics treatment on the white blood cell count. In this context we again have time-dependent confounders: the patient features change over time and are affected by the previous administration of antibiotics. Moreover, the history of the patient features also determines antibiotics administration and affects future patient outcomes.

We would like to clarify your concerns about our work. \n\n\n* Related Work *\n\nWe highlight below the differences between our work and the work of (Atan et al., 2018) (these were also described in Appendix A). Please note that (Atan et al., 2018) addresses the problem of policy optimization in the static setting which is different from causal inference.\n\n1. While (Atan et al., 2018) also use domain adversarial training to remove confounding bias in the static setting to infer optimal policies, their domains have a different meaning: the entire observational data represents the source domain and a simulated dataset where the actions (treatments) are assigned randomly represents the target domain. Through domain adversarial training they build a representation that is invariant with respect to these two domains (See Section 5.1 in (Atan et al., 2018)). In our work, the different treated populations at each time-step represent the different domains and our aim is to build a representation that is invariant with respect to the treatment received by the patient at each timestep. \n\n2. Directly extending the method proposed by (Atan et al., 2018) to handle time-varying confounders and actions would require generating random sequences of actions over time (to create their target domain), which is impractical.\n\n3. Our model performs causal inference and can be used to estimate counterfactual outcomes under intended treatments plans. Once these counterfactual outcomes are estimated, they can be used to decide optimal treatment plans and timings of treatments. Policy optimization methods, like the one in (Atan et al., 2018) directly predict an optimal treatment from the data and cannot be used for causal inference.\n\n\n* Time-dependent confounders * \n\nTime-dependent confounders are confounders that change over time depending on past treatments and that also influence future treatment assignments and outcomes. Time-dependent confounders are certainly present in observational data because treatments are generally adjusted based on the patients\u2019 response [1]. \n\nThis requires the world to be modelled as non-Markovian and for the patient history to be taken into account to be able to model how the changes in patient covariates over time affect the patient outcomes under different treatment plans. \n\nCurrent approaches for causal inference in the static setting are aimed at handling the cross-sectional set-up, where the treatment and outcome depend only on a static value of the patient covariates. If we consider each time point as an instance and represent the patient by multiple such instances, we cannot model how that patient\u2019s history which contains the time-dependent confounders affects the patient outcome. The methods that propose balancing representations for the static causal inference setting only take into account static patient features and not patient histories. \n\nPlease also refer to Appendix C where we illustrate the causal graph for time-dependent confounders and how they affect treatment assignments and outcomes. In Appendix C, we also provide an explanation based on the causal graphs about how the CRN reduces the time-dependent confounding bias.  \n\n\n* Theorem 1 *\n\nTheorem 1 shows that the treatment loss part of the objective aims to remove the confounding bias. The outcome loss part of the objective ensures that the representation preserves the information predictive of the patient outcome. The few lines after Theorem 1 in our paper also emphasize that the aim of our training objective is to find a representation that minimizes the imbalance between the treatment distributions and that can be used for estimating treatment outcome. \n\nA similar approach for removing confounding bias through balanced representations was used by Johanson et al. [2] in the static causal inference setting. Their proposed method for building the representation uses discrepancy measures (such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy) in the loss function to make treated and control distributions similar. This does not directly extend to multiple treatments (as also noted by the authors) and does not model patient history and time-dependent confounders. In our work, we measure the discrepancy between distributions based on their separability by a discriminatively-trained classifier which is directly applicable to multiple treatments. In addition, our model architecture handles the time-dependent confounders. \n\n\n***\n\nWe will also address the comments that you have mentioned for improving the paper. \n\nWe hope that our reply has addressed your concerns. We are very happy to provide further clarifications if needed!\n\n[1] Mohammad Ali Mansournia, Mahyar Etminan, Goodarz Danaei, Jay S Kaufman, and Gary Collins.

To address the problem, the authors propose an extension of the balancing representation for causal inference framework that seeks render the current treatment independent from a representation of the history of treatment and confounders. This is sensibly actualized within an RNN. The authors provide empirical results that demonstrate the proposed method performing very well in comparison to prior art. \n\nThis paper is well written, proposes a sensible solution to a difficult problem, and performs well empirically. It would be nice to see theory that connects the imbalance to the expected error of the causal estimand, and a notion of hyperparameter tuning (the authors say they search over hyperparameters but do not specify how the parameters are ultimately selected. However, I don't feel that either of those points outweigh the benefit of the paper.
