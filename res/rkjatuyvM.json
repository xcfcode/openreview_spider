While non-monotonic model learns to use a lot of \u2018benign\u2019 features, but the real-time setting does not have such features. What if we totally forbid these features for both models? \n\nThank you for raising this point. We think the explanation of \u2018benign\u2019 features in the paper turned out slightly confusing and caused a misunderstanding. \n\nHere is what we mean when we say \u2018benign\u2019 feature.\nConsider some trained model which takes an execution log as an input and returns the predicted probability of maliciousness. For simplicity, assume that our log is a sequence of events without arguments and there are 100 possible types of events. In this case, we can represent each log with 100 features (counters for all event types) without information loss.  Here we do not care about the order of events because we do not use it in any of the models. A feature from this set may be \u2018benign\u2019 for the model: if we increase the value of this feature then the prediction will decrease. A subset of features can also be \u2018benign\u2019 for the model: if we increase values of all features from this subset then the prediction will decrease. \nThe point is that this definition of \u2018benign\u2019 features depends on the model. In the non-monotonic model, we allow non-monotonic dependencies between features and predictions, therefore, it may have such \u2018benign\u2019 features. In the monotonic model, if the value of any feature increases the prediction can't decrease, therefore, \u2018benign\u2019 features are not possible in such model.\n\nBoth non-monotonic and monotonic models use an execution log as an input in any scenario (real-time or full log). The only difference is that in the full-log scenario they use a full log and in the real-time scenario they use a prefix of a log (which is also a log but a shorter one). Therefore, a feature set is the same for both scenarios. \n\n>The paper should give more explains since the gap between the two models is big in the real-time setting. \n\nWe were also very surprised by these results. From our experiments, we think that the main reason here is that the non-monotonic model is not restricted in its behavior in the middle of the log. Therefore it uses \u2018benign\u2019 features and possibly \u2018benign\u2019 groups of features which makes predictions unstable in time. We are working on more detailed experiments now. \n\n>Moreover, the analysis in the appendix is very interesting. It will be even better if the paper can include the case when the monotonic model makes mistake. \n\nThank you for the suggestion. We will work on this.\n\n>In the full-log setting, the monotonic model is worse than the non-monotonic model. Is it because it makes more false-positive predictions or vice-versa?\n\nWe also think that this question is important for understanding monotonic models. We will investigate it more but for now, the answer is both. We compared  ROC curves of the models, and the curve for the non-monotonic model is higher than curves for monotonic models everywhere. Also, we compared models with optimal thresholds, and the optimal non-monotonic model has higher TPR and lower FPR than optimal monotonic models.

It assumes that the probability of being malicious increases monotonically as new lines of codes are added into the execution log. As a result, the risk of a benign program is expected to be stable, but that of a malicious program will increase until it passes a threshold. The paper applies the monotonic classifier (e.g., min-max network) and modifies the feature extraction process under the monotonicity constraint. Experiments show that in the full-log setting, the monotonic models are close to non-monotonic models. In the real-time setting, however, monotonic models perform much better than the non-monotonic models. The paper explains that \"such behavior is that the non-monotonic model learns to use a lot of \u2018benign\u2019 features while we\nforbid monotonic models to do so\". But does that mean the experiments involve inconsistent feature sets? While non-monotonic model learns to use a lot of \u2018benign\u2019 features, but the real-time setting does not have such features. What if we totally forbid these features for both models? The paper should give more explains since the gap between the two models are big in the real-time setting. Moreover, the analysis in the appendix is very interesting. It will be even better if the paper can include the case when the monotonic model makes mistake. In the full-log setting, the monotonic model is worse than the non-monotonic model. Is it because it makes more false-positive predictions or vice-versa?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Monotonic models for real-time dynamic malware detection", "abstract": "In dynamic malware analysis, programs are classified as malware or benign based on their execution logs.
