One of the biggest challenges of a dialog task is that rewards that fully encapsulate conversation quality are difficult to generate and often easy to exploit. For example, a high reward text could be a long string of question marks and \u201chaha\u201ds. It is easy to sacrifice fluency and coherency for high reward. This is where using KL control with the learned prior is vital to maintain both realistic dialog and optimize for good dialog (high reward).  \n\nThe same initialization (same pre-trained language model) is used for all baselines (Table 1). Otherwise, there would not be enough training data to generate coherent sentences from the reward signals alone. \n\nIn Section 2, we have extensively written about the previous work using KL-control to regularize divergence from a prior policy. We will expand the references to include [1] (on-policy setting). However, this work has major differences due to being completely off-policy where the policy is unable to explore and gather more data.

KL-divergence penalties have previously been explored extensively in the on-policy setting (mainly with policy gradient methods) and the authors claim they are the first to apply this idea to off-policy RL. I am not familiar enough with related work to evaluate this statement, but given it\u2019s true, this is an interesting application of these ideas. I also like the application to dialog because pre-trained language models have been shown to offer very good priors for high-quality natural language generation.\n\nUnfortunately, before any other comments I would like to point out that this paper is not properly anonymized. Both the submitted code and the online demo that is linked to from the paper contain the author names and their affiliation (the page linked to in Section 1 contains the author names but the other one in Section 5 does not\u2014it mentions they have been redacted). Apparently there is also an arXiv version of the paper which I was not aware of and which would be fine if this version was not cited from the README file in the submitted code. Please be more careful with respect to anonymizing your submission!\n\nOverall the paper proposes an interesting algorithm that combines existing ideas in a new way and arrives at an algorithm that achieves good performance, based on the experimental evaluation provided in the paper. The experiments performed on dialog are good and I really like that human evaluation was used. However, the traditional RL experiments are lacking. The authors only present results for the CartPole environment in the main paper, which is a very easy problem and so not that interesting. In the appendix they also show results for the Acrobot environment, which are a bit weaker for WOP. Both are quite simple problems and it\u2019s quite easy to learn a good prior model. Why not present results for harder problems? It should be easy to run on more Gym environments and see if WOP still does well in harder problems. Other than that, I like the main ideas in the paper, but I think they could be presented better. Given this and the anonymization issue I lean towards rejecting this paper for now.\n\nOther comments:\n\n(1) I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the statement \u201cBecause learning language online from humans on the internet can result in inappropriate behavior (see Horton (2016)), learning offline using BRL is imperative.\u201d I would rather just say that learning offline is one way of dealing with this issue but it\u2019s not the only one or necessarily the best one. In general, the paper defends the batch RL setting quite extensively, but I feel some of the statements may be overly strong. There is a lot of prior work that shows when and why the batch RL setting is useful and so I would add more references to such work.\n\n(2) In Section A.1 you present the implicit metrics that were used and the weight of each metric. These weights seem *extremely* arbitrary to me so could you please provide some insight (and references) as to how they were chosen? I like the results presented in Table 3, in terms of the insight they provide. Are these what you used to derive the weights presented in Section A.1?\n\n(3) The yellow shading in Figure 1 is not really visible. You could try using a different color for the shading (e.g., use gray and make the walls blue or something like that).\n\n(4) The axis labels in the plots of Figure 2 are too tiny. These plots should be made bigger to be readable in printed form. Also, I would recommend you order the labels in the legend in maybe chronological order or something like, which would also put WOP at the top to clarify it\u2019s the proposed method.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not too familiar with this area of research and the related work and so my comments and evaluation should be taken into account in that context.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I did not assess the derivations or theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1121/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1121/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["jaquesn@mit.edu", "asma_gh@mit.edu", "judyshen@mit.edu", "fergusoc@mit.edu", "agata@mit.edu", "ncjones@mit.edu", "shanegu@google.com", "picard@media.mit.edu"], "title": "Way Off-Policy Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning of Human Preferences in Dialog", "authors": ["Natasha Jaques", "Asma Ghandeharioun", "Judy Hanwen Shen", "Craig Ferguson", "Agata Lapedriza", "Noah Jones", "Shixiang Gu", "Rosalind Picard"], "pdf": "/pdf/83567ae322b6b19689c31e643df4419e5eaa3924.pdf", "TL;DR": "We show that KL-control from a pre-trained prior can allow RL models to learn from a static batch of collected data, without the ability to explore online in the environment.", "abstract": "Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems are not able to learn effectively from off-policy data, especially if they cannot explore online in the environment.

The key technical contribution is by controlling the KL divergence of the learned policy with a prior policy that was learned on other dialogs. The method is able to constrain the policy not deviate too much from the prior to avoid extrapolation error. Another technical contribution is the use of dropout uncertainty estimates to estimate the Q values, which is more scalable compared to double Q-learning. The authors also incorporate intermediate implicit rewards in dialogs to encourage more positive conversations. \nIn terms of methodology, the use of dropout as uncertain estimates seem to be firstly used for DRL to my knowledge. The experiments seem to be properly conducted, with particular focus on inferring what rewards encourage positive conversations.\n\nHowever, I am not fully convinced by the motivation of using KL control. If there is too much weight on the rewards of learning of human preferences compared to reasonable sentences, one could imagine other compared methods such as batch Q-learning could fail since they will learn to encourage positive conversations and diverge away from realistic language. Using KL to control its generated dialog to the prior is a way to prevent it from diverging. But I would think that with a proper tuning of the different type of rewards could also prevent the policy from diverging to generating non-realistic dialogs especially when there is a large amount of dialogs available. If possible I would hope to see tuning on the weights of different types of rewards used in the problem setup. Also I am curious if you use the same initialization (using the same pretrained language model) for other baselines? I did not seem to find it the paper. \nAlso the proposed method using KL control shares similarity to the one in Distral [1] where a distilled policy is used as prior policy and discounted KL divergence is used as regularizer, which limits it novelty in this perspective.\n\nOverall, the paper is fairly well-written. The paper develops a method for learning human preferences in dialogs in off-policy reinforcement learning and use KL control to avoid extrapolation error issues. The technical novelty of the method is limited as there is a similar method proposed in [1]. The experiments are illustrative but more comparisons with the other methods will be appreciated to make it more convincing. \n\n[1] Teh, Yee, Victor Bapst, Wojciech M.

We test real-world generalization by deploying dialog models live to converse with humans in an open-domain setting, and demonstrate that WOP achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art prior methods in batch deep RL.\n", "code": "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XG9c4HMXwDrxTOUrVPHwR32EdnJJMuMt", "keywords": ["batch reinforcement learning", "deep learning", "dialog", "off-policy", "human preferences"], "paperhash": "jaques|way_offpolicy_batch_deep_reinforcement_learning_of_human_preferences_in_dialog", "original_pdf": "/attachment/83567ae322b6b19689c31e643df4419e5eaa3924.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\njaques2020way,\ntitle={Way Off-Policy Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning of Human Preferences in Dialog},\nauthor={Natasha Jaques and Asma Ghandeharioun and Judy Hanwen Shen and Craig Ferguson and Agata Lapedriza and Noah Jones and Shixiang Gu and Rosalind Picard},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl5rRVFvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
