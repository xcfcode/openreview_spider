Generally, I can tell probably this paper study the Monte Carlo Tree Search-based methods in the field of Reinforcement Learning. \n\nThe paper is badly written with grammatical issues almost in all the sentences. I definitely urge the author(s) to take the writing significantly more seriously. I almost all the time do not end up rejecting a paper due to the lack of clear writing, but for this paper, unfortunately, despite spending time, I could not understand the paper.\n\n\nComments beside the grammatical issues:\nI am sorry but I could not understand the abstract.\nWhat does the author(s) mean by \"In this research, the\ncoordination of episode generation was focused on.\" Same issue with almost all the sentences in the abstract. Unfortunately, I could not follow any of them. Moreover, this paper is full of inaccurate and unjustified statements. Furthermore, again, unfortunately, this paper does not represent even the preliminary elements of scientific writing.\n\n\nI decided to provide further comments, but sadly I had to change my mind because otherwise, I had to write at least one paragraph of explanation for each paragraph of this paper. With that regard, I do not think it is an appropriate way to utilize the review process. But I would be happy to provide more abstract comments upon request.
