Summary:**\n\nThe authors propose a module that regresses the parameters of an affine transformation or homography as an additional objective in the contrastive self-supervised learning framework. The authors argue that the geometric information encoded in the proposed module can supplement the signal provided by a contrastive loss, improving both performance and convergence speed. The authors validate their claims with two recent contrastive self-supervised learning approaches (i.e., SimCLR, BYOL) on several benchmark datasets showing effective results.\n\n**2. Strengths:**\n\n+ The authors extend the typical contrastive objective with an additional homography estimation objective to enforce non-invariance to the affine transformation or homography. This extension is well motivated, and the authors provide a clear intuition for the proposed module.\n\n+ The authors evaluate the proposed module on several benchmarks showing nice results.\n\n**3. Weaknesses:**\n\nWhile the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module on several considered datasets, some points make me concerned about the actual usefulness of this module:\n\n- The authors conduct the empirical study on three small-scale datasets (i.e., CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN). This is fine in itself, however, without experiments on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, it is unknown whether the conclusion still holds since most of the previous effective contrastive learning methods (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL) are originally conducted on ImageNet. It would be better for the authors to provide such experiments to further validate the claims. In this case, there is no need to perform experiments with large batch size to achieve state-of-the-art performance, just a normal batch size (e.g., 256) can validate the effectiveness of the proposed module.\n\n- The authors show significant improvements across all datasets with the proposed module in Table 2 and Table 3. However, as shown in Table 4, when pretrained for longer epoches, the relative benefit diminishes and even degrades the performance a little. Although the authors give a brief explanation on this phenomenon, I am concerned whether the proposed module is actually useful when SimCLR and BYOL have sufficiently converged.\n\n- The authors use the linear evaluation to measure the quality of learned representations by pre-training and fine-tuning on the same dataset. Although it is one of the common evaluation protocols, pre-training and fine-tuning on the same dataset may induce some inevitable biases. Therefore, it would be better to provide more empirical evidence by transferring to other datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed module.\n\nTo sum up, although the paper is interesting, I think it requires more work (see points W1-W3 above) in order to become more complete and convincing. Therefore, I am leaning towards rejection.\n\n====================================================================================\n\n**Post-Rebuttal**\n\nAfter reading the rebuttal and the other reviewers' comments, my concerns persist:\n\n- The technical contribution is limited. Adding a pretext task of homography prediction itself brings little insights regarding how it improves upon contrastive representation learning from a different perspective. \n\n- The experimental results are not convincing compared to the recent advances. The authors are encouraged to include ImageNet results as well as transfer learning evaluation.\n\nTherefore, I would like to keep my initial rating as rejection.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Explicit homography estimation improves contrastive self-supervised learning", "authorids": ["~David_Torpey1", "~Richard_Klein1"], "authors": ["David Torpey", "Richard Klein"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "The typical contrastive self-supervised algorithm uses a similarity measure in latent space as the supervision signal by contrasting positive and negative images directly or indirectly.

They clarified a lot of my questions and hopefully in the process they were able to improve the paper. However, my listed weaknesses still stand:\n* there is no transfer learning experiments\n* there not seem to be any consistent gains with the proposed approach over other methods, as seen in Table 4, after 500 epochs (when the models indeed have probably converged). Gains can be seen for 100 epochs, but from the absolute numbers  it is obvious that models havent really convered at that time. Furthermore, as the authors clarified,  they do require  30% higher training time, something that make the claim that they learn faster even weaker\n* There is no analysis It is unclear why/how forcing the feature vectors difference to be predictive (ie encode) the transformation and learning representations that are non-invariant to homography transforms actually helps for learning better representations. In fact, It turns out that simpler versions of the proposed module than homography estimation are the ones giving the best results. \n\nI will therefore retain my rejection rating.\n\n\n====================================================\n\nSummary:\n\nThe authors propose a module and objective that can be added to recent contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks like SimCLR or BYOL. The module p`erforms an affine or homography transformation $\\phi$ on the input $x_1$. Then the difference of the features of $x_1$ and the geometrically transformed version are the input to an MLP that tries to regress to the parameters of  transformation $\\phi$, using an MSE loss. The authors show gains on CIFAR and SVHN by adding this module over SimCLR and BYOL. \n\nStrong points: The authors show that adding this module speeds up SSL pre-training during early epochs.\n\n\nWeak points: \n\nA) The authors do not measure transfer learning performance and evaluate *only* on a very superficial setup, where they train linear classifiers on top of encoders that are pre-trained with contrastive SSL learning on the exact same datasets.  Although this is indeed an experiment popular among SSL papers,  in all recent SSL works like SimCLR and BYOL the linear evaluation on the same dataset (usually imagenet) is only a small part of the evaluation suite that also involves testing performance on many different tasks and datasets. Transfer learning performance here is not measured, nor is performance on  semi-supervised learning tasks.\n\nB) The authors show some gains and faster learning for the first epochs of SSL pre-training. However, results should be taken with a pinch of salt as their gains are only visible in a realm where performance is still clearly suboptimal and learning is far from converged (eg for CIFAR100,  31.33 at epoch 100 vs 42.53 at epoch 500) To their credit, the authors themselves clearly say this in the text and show in Table 4. However they only present results at 100 and then 500 epochs, so it is hard to understand when (at which epoch) the two lines \"cross\" - at which epoch does the proposed approach stop giving gains? \n\nC) There is no analysis It is unclear why/how forcing the feature vectors difference to be predictive (ie encode) the transformation and learning representations that are non-invariant to homography transforms actually helps for learning better representations. In fact, It turns out that simpler versions of the proposed module than homography estimation are the ones giving the best results. In Table 5, the authors show that most of the gain can be achieved by only predicting the 2-dim sheer tranformation; this is something potentially interesting that the authors however do not investigate any further.\n\nQuestions and notes:\n* Although not used for SSL, the authors should cite and discuss the Spatial Transformer module of [Jaderberg et al 2015]\n* The notation could be clearer (eg although clearly explained in the text, it is a bit confusing that augmentation/transformation $a_2$ is sampled from set $T_1$ and $a_\\phi$ from $T_2$)\n* Design ablations: The authors use vector difference as the input to MLP h to regress to the transformation parameters, but other reasoning modules could also be used. How would performance be affected for other input functions beyond difference, eg concatenation or elementwise multiplication?\n* There area number of hyperparameter choices in Table 1 that do not match the corresponding papers (eg BYOL uses LARS not SGD). Why wasn't the original protocol followed, and were all the differences ablated?\n* How do you balance the two losses in Eq(5)? Is there no hyperparameter? what would happen if you favor one or the other loss?\n* How would performance change if this module was added after g() instead of f()?\n* Why only on $x_1$? Could there be extra gains if the MSE loss was also applied over $x_2$?\n* What is the added cost of the module in terms of training time? \n* It is unclear to me what the variance measures: Is it for results after multiple runs, and if so, how many runs? Were the multiple runs from scratch or only for the linear evaluation?\n* In Figure 2, how often was performance tested? markers would help understand where datapoints are.\n* The datasets used are relatively small and more importantly in very low resolution. Would the same hold for higher resolution datasets?\n* How dataset biased are the results presented? E.g. invariance to homographies might not be beneficial to digits (6 and 9 is a good example) but it would be useful in eg landmark datasets. Maybe a more suiting dataset/task would be something related to localization\n* [Tian et al 2020] is another related paper that could be discussed - there the authors explore different augmentations to get invariance to, and show highly increased performance even after longer training.\n\nReferences:\n[Jaderberg et al 2015] Spatial transformer networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2015.\n[Tian et al 2020] What makes for good views for contrastive learning, Arxiv May 2020, accepted at NeurIPS 2020 (not officially published yet)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Explicit homography estimation improves contrastive self-supervised learning", "authorids": ["~David_Torpey1", "~Richard_Klein1"], "authors": ["David Torpey", "Richard Klein"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "The typical contrastive self-supervised algorithm uses a similarity measure in latent space as the supervision signal by contrasting positive and negative images directly or indirectly.

This is fine in itself, however, without experiments on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, it is unknown whether the conclusion still holds since most of the previous effective contrastive learning methods (e.g., SimCLR, BYOL) are originally conducted on ImageNet. It would be better for the authors to provide such experiments to further validate the claims. In this case, there is no need to perform experiments with large batch size to achieve state-of-the-art performance, just a normal batch size (e.g., 256) can validate the effectiveness of the proposed module.\n\nA1: We agree with the reviewer that ImageNet is an ideal experiment to include in the paper. However, we were unable to include it due to computational resource limitations. We will be running these experiments in future work.\n\n\nQ2: The authors show significant improvements across all datasets with the proposed module in Table 2 and Table 3. However, as shown in Table 4, when pretrained for longer epoches, the relative benefit diminishes and even degrades the performance a little. Although the authors give a brief explanation on this phenomenon, I am concerned whether the proposed module is actually useful when SimCLR and BYOL have sufficiently converged.\n\nA2: We understand the reviewer's concern. However, we argue that at 500 epochs (see Table 4), the methods have indeed converged for these small-scale datasets. This is evidenced by the fact that for a much more difficult dataset (ImageNet), SimCLR was only trained for 100 epochs.\n\nFurther, a primary aim of our work is to demonstrate the fact that being able to predict a homography/affine transformation as an additional objective provides the network with additional information during learning not available to it from the contrastive loss (particularly early on in learning). We opine that this is a useful finding, and merits further investigation into ways to improve or supplement contrastive SSL methods.\n\n\nQ3: The authors use the linear evaluation to measure the quality of learned representations by pre-training and fine-tuning on the same dataset. Although it is one of the common evaluation protocols, pre-training and fine-tuning on the same dataset may induce some inevitable biases. Therefore, it would be better to provide more empirical evidence by transferring to other datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed module.\n\nA3: We definitely agree with the reviewer. As per response A1, we will in future work be conducting experiments on ImageNet, including transfer learning experiments to be consistent with previous work.

In future work we will be investigating the effect of invariance on a host of downstream tasks (object detection and semantic segmentation).

Beyond that, we don't see any clear link. Could the reviewer clarify the reason to include this work?\n\n\nQ2: The notation could be clearer (eg although clearly explained in the text, it is a bit confusing that augmentation/transformation $a_2$ is sampled from set $T_1$ and $a_{\\phi}$ from $T_2$)\n\nA2: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will change the text to make the notation clearer.\n\n\nQ3: Design ablations: The authors use vector difference as the input to MLP h to regress to the transformation parameters, but other reasoning modules could also be used. How would performance be affected for other input functions beyond difference, eg concatenation or elementwise multiplication?\n\nA3: We definitely agree with the reviewer. We did indeed previously consider concatenation as an alternative way to represent the transformation instead of vector difference. However, from preliminary experiments the performance difference was negligible. We are currently scaling the concatenation experiments to get final numbers on this.\n\n\nQ4: There area number of hyperparameter choices in Table 1 that do not match the corresponding papers (eg BYOL uses LARS not SGD). Why wasn't the original protocol followed, and were all the differences ablated?\n\nA4: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The only difference between the original protocols are the optimiser-related hyperparameters. In preliminary experiments, we did indeed trial LARS with original hyperparameter values, however performance was significantly worse (borderline usable). Adam performed much better with far less hyperparameter tuning on these small-scale benchmarks. We posit that this is due to the hyperparameters in the paper being optimised for ImageNet, whereas datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN require significantly different hyperparameters to train. In ImageNet experiments that we will be doing in future work, we will be using the original protocols.\n\n\nQ5: How do you balance the two losses in Eq(5)? Is there no hyperparameter? what would happen if you favor one or the other loss?\n\nA5: We agree with the reviewer that this is indeed a useful study to perform. We plan to do this in future work involving multiple kinds of downstream tasks (object detection and semantic segmentation). We posit that because the SSL algorithms with and without the module eventually appear to converge, balancing of the losses may need to be based on a schedule that favours one term of the loss more than the other over time.\n\n\nQ6: How would performance change if this module was added after g() instead of f()?\n\nA6: We definitely agree with the reviewer. We did indeed previously consider investigate using $g$ instead of $f$ for this. However, our experiments showed that the performance difference using $g$ is worse: 64.38 on CIFAR10; 29.99 on CIFAR100; and 82.49 on SVHN using SimCLR. We will add these findings to the appendix.\n\n\nQ7: Why only on $x_1$? Could there be extra gains if the MSE loss was also applied over $x_2$?\n\nA7: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We did instead trial adding our module to both $x_1$ and $x_2$. However, the performance different was negligible. We posit that this is because if the one module can solve homography estimation for $x_1$, then a module operating on $x_2$ will have to be able to solve homography estimation for it, because the same types of random homographies/affine transforms are being applied to both. \n\n\nQ8: What is the added cost of the module in terms of training time? \n\nA8: Total SSL training time is 30% larger on average with our module. We will systemically profile the training to identify where the bottleneck lies, and update you accordingly.\n\n\nQ9: It is unclear to me what the variance measures: Is it for results after multiple runs, and if so, how many runs? Were the multiple runs from scratch or only for the linear evaluation?\n\nA9: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. This measure represents 10 random trials. Each run is a full pipeline trained from scratch: SSL pretraining + linear evaluation.

Although this is indeed an experiment popular among SSL papers, in all recent SSL works like SimCLR and BYOL the linear evaluation on the same dataset (usually imagenet) is only a small part of the evaluation suite that also involves testing performance on many different tasks and datasets. Transfer learning performance here is not measured, nor is performance on semi-supervised learning tasks.\n\nA1: We agree with the reviewer that ImageNet is an ideal experiment to include in the paper. However, we were unable to include it due to computational resource limitations. We will be running these experiments in future work, including transfer learning experiments to be consistent with previous work.\n\n\nQ2: The authors show some gains and faster learning for the first epochs of SSL pre-training. However, results should be taken with a pinch of salt as their gains are only visible in a realm where performance is still clearly suboptimal and learning is far from converged (eg for CIFAR100, 31.33 at epoch 100 vs 42.53 at epoch 500) To their credit, the authors themselves clearly say this in the text and show in Table 4. However they only present results at 100 and then 500 epochs, so it is hard to understand when (at which epoch) the two lines \"cross\" - at which epoch does the proposed approach stop giving gains? \n\nA2: We understand the reviewer's concern. However, we argue that at 500 epochs, datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN have indeed converged. Previous works (e.g. SimCLR) train for 100 epochs on the much more complicated ImageNet dataset. We will run experiments to train the methods for longer (1000 epochs) to verify this hypothesis. We will report results once they're in.\n\n\nQ3: There is no analysis It is unclear why/how forcing the feature vectors difference to be predictive (ie encode) the transformation and learning representations that are non-invariant to homography transforms actually helps for learning better representations. In fact, It turns out that simpler versions of the proposed module than homography estimation are the ones giving the best results. In Table 5, the authors show that most of the gain can be achieved by only predicting the 2-dim sheer tranformation; this is something potentially interesting that the authors however do not investigate any further.\n\nA3: We definitely agree with the reviewer. We did indeed previously consider concatenation as an alternative way to represent the transformation instead of vector difference. However, from preliminary experiments the performance difference was negligible. We are currently scaling the concatenation experiments to get final numbers on this.\n\nRegarding the reviewer's concern about the shear transformation outperforming SimCLR on SVHN, we would like to note that this marginal performance improvement of shear only occurred in 1 of 6 cases. Further, from visual inspection of samples from the SVHN dataset, we posit that shear appears to the most useful transformation to be able to encode for such house number images. We plan to investigate the transformation component analysis in future work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Explicit homography estimation improves contrastive self-supervised learning", "authorids": ["~David_Torpey1", "~Richard_Klein1"], "authors": ["David Torpey", "Richard Klein"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "The typical contrastive self-supervised algorithm uses a similarity measure in latent space as the supervision signal by contrasting positive and negative images directly or indirectly.

Importantly, we ensure that this module does not enforce invariance to the various components of the affine transform, as this is not always ideal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional objective on two recent, popular self-supervised algorithms. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of the proposed method and show an improvement in performance for all considered datasets. Further, we find that although both the general homography and affine transformation are sufficient to improve performance and convergence, the affine transformation performs better in all cases.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "torpey|explicit_homography_estimation_improves_contrastive_selfsupervised_learning", "one-sentence_summary": "Explicit homography estimation improves contrastive self-supervised learning", "pdf": "/pdf/5d773534ff8067050015baa0e31582613488982c.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=9aQXgJj6Ql", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ntorpey2021explicit,\ntitle={Explicit homography estimation improves contrastive self-supervised learning},\nauthor={David Torpey and Richard Klein},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=bWqodw-mFi1}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).

In experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, improvement of a up to a few % points is observed.\n\nThe technique is close to augmentation and experimenting with A and H is not novel. \n\nThere are issues with the experiments:\n1. a certain representation of A and H was chosen. Other decompositions are possible. Is the ad hoc chosen one suitable? Have other options been considered?\n2. the representation of A and H influences the sampling. \n3. the three problems used for demonstrations are quite similar. It is unclear what type of vision problems would benefit from this technique.\n\nParts of the paper state well-known facts (description of H and A, there properties), some are irrelevant - for instance par 2. in the intro about transfer learning. More details should be provided about SimCLR and BYOL to make the submission more self-contained.\n\nI see very limited benefit to the reader.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1502/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Explicit homography estimation improves contrastive self-supervised learning", "authorids": ["~David_Torpey1", "~Richard_Klein1"], "authors": ["David Torpey", "Richard Klein"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "The typical contrastive self-supervised algorithm uses a similarity measure in latent space as the supervision signal by contrasting positive and negative images directly or indirectly.
