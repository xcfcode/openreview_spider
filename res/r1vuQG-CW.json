I increase my rating from 5 to 7. The authors could also integrate their discussion about their results on CIFAR in the paper, I think it would help readers understand better the advantage of the contribution.\n\n----\n\nThis paper is based on the theory of group equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs), proposed by Cohen and Welling ICML'16.\n\nRegular convolutions are translation-equivariant, meaning that if an image is translated, its convolution by any filter is also translated. They are however not rotation-invariant for example.  G-CNN introduces G-convolutions, which are equivariant to a given transformation group G.\n\nThis paper proposes an efficient implementation of G-convolutions for 6-fold rotations (rotations of multiple of 60 degrees), using a hexagonal lattice. The approach is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and AID, a dataset of aerial scene classification. The approach outperforms G-convolutions implemented on a squared lattice, which allows only 4-fold rotations on AID by a short margin. On CIFAR-10, the difference does not seem significative (according to Tables 1 and 2).\nI guess this can be explained by the fact that rotation equivariance makes sense for aerial images, where the scene is mostly fronto-parallel, but less for CIFAR (especially in the upper layers), which exhibits 3D objects.\n\nI like the general approach of explicitly putting desired equivariance in the convolutional networks. Using a hexagonal lattice is elegant, even if it is not new in computer vision (as written in the paper). However, as the transformation group is limited to rotations, this is interesting in practice mostly for fronto-parallel scenes, as the experiences seem to show. It is not clear how the method can be extended to other groups than 2D rotations.\n\nMoreover, I feel like the paper sometimes tries to mask the fact that the proposed method is limited to rotations. It is admittedly clearly stated in the abstract and introduction, but much less in the rest of the paper.\n\nThe second paragraph of Section 5.1 is difficult to keep in a paper. It says that \"From a qualitative inspection of these hexagonal interpolations we conclude that no information is lost during the sampling procedure.\"  \"No information is lost\" is a strong statement from a qualitative inspection, especially of a hexagonal image.  This statement should probably be removed. One way to evaluate the information lost could be to iterate interpolation between hexagonal and squared lattices to see if the image starts degrading at some point.\n\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "HexaConv", "abstract": "The effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks stems in large part from their ability to exploit the translation invariance that is inherent in many learning problems.

In our experiments we do show that an identical network architecture where conventional conv layers are replaced by hexagonal g-conv layers, results in consistent improvements on two distinct datasets. Furthermore, we plan to release our codebase which can help further research to scale these methods to larger problems.\n\nOn the group convolution operator:\nWe think it is a very good suggestion to change group convolution operators from * to *_g, to clarify what type of convolution is used. We changed the relevant operators in the updated paper.\n\nOn exact translation equivariance in CNNs: \nWe agree with the reviewer that in order for equivariance to hold exactly, either:\nshifts should be cyclic, or\nOne should use \u201cvalid\u201d-mode convolutions and consider the input image as a function defined on all of Z^2, where values outside of the original image are zero.\nIn practice, we use \u201csame\u201d convolution instead of \u201cvalid\u201d convolution, because the latter would increase the size of the feature maps with each layer. Thus, a typical convolutional network is not exactly translation equivariant. We have added a footnote that addresses this detail.\n\nOn spellchecking:\nWe have run a spellchecker and fixed the spelling mistakes.

We understand the concern of the reviewer that these differences are small for the CIFAR dataset. The results of the experiments were collected over 10 different runs with random parameter initializations. The experiments section of the paper has been updated to emphasize that the values are obtained by taking the average of 10 runs. To show statistical significance of 6-fold rotational symmetries over 4-fold rotational symmetries, we have done a significance test on our data. We test p4 and p4m versus p6 and p6m (our method) in a pairwise t-test, and find it passes with p=0.036. \n\nAlso, it should not be undervalued that our method outperforms a transfer learning approach on AID, that has been pretrained on ImageNet. Our method reduces classification error by 2% compared to networks that leverage only 4-fold symmetries. And our methods improve the error of conventional network by more than 11%.\n\nOn extensions to other groups than 2D rotations:\nThe reviewer is right to observe that in fronto-parallel scenes, this method can leverage global symmetries in the picture. Nonetheless, our experiments on CIFAR-10 show that although the margin of the benefits is smaller, our method can leverage local symmetries on a smaller scale and improve performance. These findings agree with earlier experiments by Cohen and Welling who used only 4-fold symmetries.\n\nOn masking limitations to the group of rotations:\nIt is not our intention to mask in any way that our method is limited to mirror and rotation transformations. Note that although the mathematical framework introduced by Cohen and Welling can be used for any group, in some cases, such the case of 6-fold rotational symmetry, the concrete implementation is far from trivial. Our paper is focused on the various data structures and indexing schemes that are required for an efficient implementation of hexagonal G-convolutions. If the reviewer is not entirely satisfied after the updates we made to the paper, perhaps the reviewer can help us by pointing to specific locations that could be improved in this respect.\n\nOn information loss conclusion by qualitative inspection: \nWe completely agree with the reviewer this is not a precise claim. None of the conclusions on our paper depend on this claim. Moreover, classification performance does not degrade when using hex-images. The paragraph is rephrased in the updated paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "HexaConv", "abstract": "The effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks stems in large part from their ability to exploit the translation invariance that is inherent in many learning problems.

Recently, it was shown that CNNs can exploit other invariances, such as rotation invariance, by using group convolutions instead of planar convolutions. However, for reasons of performance and ease of implementation, it has been necessary to limit the group convolution to transformations that can be applied to the filters without interpolation. Thus, for images with square pixels, only integer translations, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees, and reflections are admissible.\n\nWhereas the square tiling provides a 4-fold rotational symmetry, a hexagonal tiling of the plane has a 6-fold rotational symmetry. In this paper we show how one can efficiently implement planar convolution and group convolution over hexagonal lattices, by re-using existing highly optimized convolution routines. We find that, due to the reduced anisotropy of hexagonal filters, planar HexaConv provides better accuracy than planar convolution with square filters, given a fixed parameter budget. Furthermore, we find that the increased degree of symmetry of the hexagonal grid increases the effectiveness of group convolutions, by allowing for more parameter sharing. We show that our method significantly outperforms conventional CNNs on the AID aerial scene classification dataset, even outperforming ImageNet pre-trained models.", "pdf": "/pdf/57cf39e2d251945bd3776bdb4bf3545d2c7f166d.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce G-HexaConv, a group equivariant convolutional neural network on hexagonal lattices.", "paperhash": "hoogeboom|hexaconv", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nhoogeboom2018hexaconv,\ntitle={HexaConv},\nauthor={Emiel Hoogeboom and Jorn W.T.
