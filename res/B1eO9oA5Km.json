Furthermore, a deep Q-learning style scheduling algorithm is proposed to optimize the overall architecture.\n\nThe writing of the paper needs a major improvement. As a reviewer, I had a very hard time trying to understand the paper, while the proposed idea turns out to be conceptually simple. A few points regarding the writing:\n1) Figure 1 is impossible to understand, especially that zero explanation is given in the caption.\n2) Too many unnecessary definitions and acronyms such as ISE, CISE, GLF, GDL, AE etc. Essentially, only the notion of bi-direction attention entropy is relevant for the purpose of the paper. Much effort should have been dedicated to explaining the idea of the of bi-direction attention entropy instead of irrelevant terminologies.\n3) No objective function or algorithm description is ever shown.\n\nTechnically, I am skeptical about the use of deep Q-learning as a scheduling algorithm. Usually, a Q-net requires training before it can be deployed in an evaluation environment. However, here the paper seems to suggest that the Q-net is trained and deployed together with the NMT architecture in an online fashion. Why use a Q-net in an online setting is beyond my understanding. Ideally, one would choose a truly online algorithm (i.e. UCB for stochastic bandits) in such scenarios, which I believe would work even better than deep Q-learning in practice.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper547/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Guider Network for Multi-Dual Learning", "abstract": "A large amount of parallel data is needed to train a strong neural machine translation (NMT) system.

(2) Multiple languages are used in this framework, where each language also has a $GN_i$  for guiding the training according to the reconstruction error. The authors work on MultiUN dataset to verify their algorithms.\n \n[Clarity]\nThis work is not easy to follow. My suggestions to revise the paper are shown as follows:\n(1) Please use the \\begin{equation}\u2026\\end{equation} environment to clearly describe your framework and training objectives, with each notation, function and hyper-parameter clearly defined. Actually, I do not find the training objective function in this paper.\nBesides, currently, in this paper, there are many undefined notations and typos, for example, (1) in section 3.1, first paragraph, what is the $n$? Then in Eqn.(1) ,what is $N$ and $M$? Also, it is very confusing to use subscripts $i$ and $j$ to distinguish the hidden states from the encoder and decoder. (2) What is the mathematical definition of $ISE_i$? (3) In page 5, 3rd line, \u201cthen ISD_i is used to reconstruct Si = GNi(ISE_i , \\theta)\u2026\u201d Should the ISE_i be ISD_i?\n(2) Please use \\begin{algorithm}\u2026\\end{algorithm} to tell the readers how your framework works.\n \n[Details]\n1. The first question is \u201cwhy this problem\u201d. In the 3rd paragraph of page 1, you mentioned that \u201cHowever, the best direction to update parameters heavily relies on the quality of sampled translations ... which may be far from real translations Y due to inaccurate translations existing in the sampled ones\u2026\u2026\u201d But in practice, dual learning as well as back-translation [ref1] works well for many language pairs. In particular, the dual learning and back-translation works for the unsupervised NMT [ref2], where no labeled data is available. Therefore, I am not fully convinced by this claim and then, the motivation of this work. What\u2019s more, this paper does not work on standard WMT dataset, while previous dual learning and back-translation work on that most commonly used dataset. Therefore, the comparison between the guider network and dual learning are not fair.\n2. I am not sure how the BDE in Eqn. (1) is related to the NMT translation quality. Any reference or theoretical/empirical proofs? \n3. It is hard to reproduce such a complex NMT system with NMT, GN and an RL scheduler. Any open-source code or any simple solutions?\n4. Do you use a single-layer LSTM or a deep LSTM? Transformer [ref3] is the state-of-the-art NMT system. Why don\u2019t you choose this system? Also, you do not work on WMT dataset to verify your GLF-2L (Table 1). Therefore, I cannot justify whether the proposed algorithm is efficient compared to the current NMT algorithms. I am not convinced by the experimental results.\n5. The connection/difference between this work and (Tu et al 2017) should be discussed clearly, and you should implement (Tu et al 2017) as your baseline.  Besides, for the 3-language setting, no multilingual baseline is implemented.\n \n[Pros & Cons]\n(+) This paper tries to extend dual learning from word level to hidden state level;\n(+) Multiple languages are involved in this framework;\n(-) Experiments are not convincing; the models are weak; many important baselines are missing; no results on widely used WMT datasets;\n(-) The paper is not easy to follow.

Building on recent work on unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, we propose a multi-dual learning framework to improve the performance of NMT by using an almost infinite amount of available monolingual data and some parallel data of other languages. Since our framework involves multiple languages and components, we further propose a timing optimization method that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimally schedule the different components in order to avoid imbalanced training. Experimental results  demonstrate the validity of our model, and confirm its superiority to existing dual learning methods.", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["wenpeng.hu@pku.edu.cn", "tttzw@pku.edu.cn", "zhanxing.zhu@pku.edu.cn", "liub@uic.edu", "jokerlin@pku.edu.cn", "jwma@math.pku.edu.cn", "zhaody@pku.edu.cn", "ruiyan@pku.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Wenpeng Hu", "Zhengwei Tao", "Zhanxing Zhu", "Bing Liu", "Zhou Lin", "Jinwen Ma", "Dongyan Zhao", "Rui Yan"], "pdf": "/pdf/650795e676ea63ab875bbd9b7f8a8d1868916338.pdf", "paperhash": "hu|a_guider_network_for_multidual_learning", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nhu2019a,\ntitle={A Guider Network for Multi-Dual Learning},\nauthor={Wenpeng Hu and Zhengwei Tao and Zhanxing Zhu and Bing Liu and Zhou Lin and Jinwen Ma and Dongyan Zhao and Rui Yan},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1eO9oA5Km},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper547/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234436597, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "B1eO9oA5Km", "replyto": "B1eO9oA5Km", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper547/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335748917, "tmdate": 1552335748917, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper547/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 5}
