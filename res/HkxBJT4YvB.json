However, based on the objective function in Equations (3-6), it appears that there are no explicit constraints on what information $Rep(\\Delta)$ can learn to embed: it could be $\\Delta$ and even some $\\Upsilon$. \n\nYour question is about the extreme case: why optimization does not lead to learning a $Rep(\\Upsilon)$ that embeds no information (i.e., learns only noise) and a $Rep(\\Delta)$ that learns to embed both $\\Delta$ and $\\Upsilon$.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a theoretical proof that this won\u2019t occur, but have a hypothesis that is also supported by empirical evidence. As mentioned earlier, the discrepancy term works as a sieve, allowing only the $\\Upsilon$ factors (ones that are related to only Y, but not X nor T) to be learned by $Rep(\\Upsilon)$. If all $\\Upsilon$ are represented by $Rep(\\Upsilon)$, then due to regularization, $Rep(\\Delta)$ will not represent any $\\Upsilon$ and would only represent $\\Delta$. This is the desired case. However, if some $\\Upsilon$ are left out and not represented by $Rep(\\Upsilon)$, $Rep(\\Delta)$ must compensate and represent them, which effectively will reduce the capacity of $Rep(\\Delta)$ to represent $\\Delta$ -- i.e., factors that cannot be represented by any of the other components. \n\nOur hypothesis is that this bottle-neck implicitly derives the optimization procedure to learn to distinguish $\\Delta$ from $\\Upsilon$.\n\nWe empirically tested this hypothesis by limiting the capacity of the $Rep(\\Upsilon)$ network (by reducing the number of hidden neurons -- from 30 to 15 to 0) while increasing the capacity of $Rep(\\Delta)$ (from 30 to 45 to 60 respectively). Our performance results are best at the (30, 30) setting and worsen as the capacity of $Rep(\\Upsilon)$ is decreased, regardless of whether the capacity of $Rep(\\Delta)$ is increased. A particularly important observation is that the increase in the capacity of $Rep(\\Delta)$ does not replace the need for having a separate $Rep(\\Upsilon)$ network: It must be $Rep(\\Upsilon)$ that embeds $\\Upsilon$, not $Rep(\\Delta)$.\n\nSee the Figures here: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hassanpo/misc/rev_Liu.PNG"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Disentangled Representations for CounterFactual Regression", "authors": ["Negar Hassanpour", "Russell Greiner"], "authorids": ["hassanpo@ualberta.ca", "rgreiner@ualberta.ca"], "keywords": ["Counterfactual Regression", "Causal Effect Estimation", "Selection Bias", "Off-policy Learning"], "abstract": "We consider the challenge of estimating treatment effects from observational data; and point out that, in general, only some factors based on the observed covariates X contribute to selection of the treatment T, and only some to determining the outcomes Y.

There are 2 strategies to do this: \n(i) estimating the outcomes of all possible treatments -- then as a by-product, design the policy such that it selects the treatment promising the best outcome. \n(ii) defining a utility function based on the (importance sampling) weighted observed outcomes to directly learn the policy that optimizes the utility.\nOur goal in this work is estimating the Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) -- i.e., $Y^1 -Y^0$, not learning an optimal policy $\\pi( T | X )$. That is, we want to do (i) but do not care about its by-product. \n\nLooking closer at (Eq. 2), we see that unlike (ii), our method is not stuck with a fixed logger policy $\\pi_0( t | x )$ that limits the space for policy search. Instead, we have a tunable denominator $\\pi( t | \\phi )$ (since $\\phi$ is learnable) that can be controlled such that it never becomes too small to de-stabilize the optimization. This however requires coupling the objective function $J( \\phi, h )$ (Eqs. 3-6) with the cost function $C( \\pi )$ for learning $\\pi( t | \\phi )$ through $\\phi$ (making it $C( \\pi, \\phi )$ -- FYI, we previously tried this idea but found the optimization did not converge).\n\nA better way would be to employ the CRM principle to enforce learning weights with low variance. We just gave it a quick empirical assessment and the performance seems promising in some cases.

More precisely, is $T \\perp Y  |  X$ -- i.e., are there no active paths in the Belief Net (Figure 3) connecting $T$ to $Y$, given $X$?\n\nThe answer is Yes: \nOnce the model (here, representation networks) is learned from the training data $\\{ [ x_i, y_i, t_i ] \\}_{i=1..N}$, we can then compute the latent factors $\\{ \\Gamma, \\Delta, \\Upsilon \\}$ from $X$ only. Therefore, although these factors are not explicitly observed, they are effectively observed, in that they are derived directly from the observed $X$, and so should not be categorized as \u201cunobserved confounders\u201d. For example, the latent factor for \u201czip code\u201d in $X$ is \u201csocio-economic status\u201d (perhaps in $\\Delta$). In other words, \u201csocio-economic status\u201d can be inferred from \u201czip code\u201d which can be viewed as a proxy for it. Observing either $X$ or $\\Delta$ blocks the path from $T$ to $Y$, which supports the assumption of unconfoundedness.\n\nUnconfoundedness (and consequently ignorability) only breaks when we have truly unobserved confounders (let\u2019s refer to them as $U$ -- in contrast with the essentially-observed confounders that are derived from $X$). For example, the doctor looks at the patient\u2019s MRI scan ($U$) and based on that prescribes surgery ($T$); note that the information present in the scan will also affect the patient's outcome ($Y$). However, as the scan is not filed in the patient\u2019s health records, it is not part of $X$, and so it is not observed.\n\nWe have updated the manuscript to address your valuable comment; see the modified parts in the paper, marked as R1, in green: \n(i) Figure 3 on page 3\n(ii) Footnote on page 4\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Disentangled Representations for CounterFactual Regression", "authors": ["Negar Hassanpour", "Russell Greiner"], "authorids": ["hassanpo@ualberta.ca", "rgreiner@ualberta.ca"], "keywords": ["Counterfactual Regression", "Causal Effect Estimation", "Selection Bias", "Off-policy Learning"], "abstract": "We consider the challenge of estimating treatment effects from observational data; and point out that, in general, only some factors based on the observed covariates X contribute to selection of the treatment T, and only some to determining the outcomes Y.

Observational data for X,T,Y is available and strong ignorability is assumed. Previous work (Shalit et al 2017) introduced learning a representation that is invariant in distribution across treatment and control groups and using that with treatment to estimate Y. However, authors point out that this representation being forced to be invariant still does not drive the selection bias to zero. A follow up work (Hassanpour and Greiner 2019) - corrects for this by using additional importance weighting that estimates the treatment selection bias given the learnt representation. However, the authors point out even this is not complete in general, as X could be determined by three latent factors, one that is the actual confounder between treatment and outcome and the other that affects only the outcome and the other that affects only the treatment. Therefore, the authors propose to have three representations and enforce independence between representation that solely determines outcome and the treatment and make other appropriate terms depend on the respective latent factors. This gives a modified objective with respect to these two prior works.\n\nThe authors implement optimize this joint system on synthetic and real world datasets. They show that they outperform all these previous works because of explicitly accounting for confounder, latent factors that solely control only outcome and treatment assignment respectively. \n\nPros:\n  This paper directly addresses the problems due to Shalit 2017 that are still left open. The experimental results seems convincing on standard benchmarks. \n\nI vote for accepting the paper. I don't have many concerns about this paper.\n\nCons:\n  - I have one question for the authors - if T and Y(0),Y(1) are independent given X is assumed, then how are we sure that the composite representations (of the three latent factors) are going to necessarily satisfy ignorability provably ?? I guess this cannot be formally established. It would be great for the authors to comment on this.\n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Disentangled Representations for CounterFactual Regression", "authors": ["Negar Hassanpour", "Russell Greiner"], "authorids": ["hassanpo@ualberta.ca", "rgreiner@ualberta.ca"], "keywords": ["Counterfactual Regression", "Causal Effect Estimation", "Selection Bias", "Off-policy Learning"], "abstract": "We consider the challenge of estimating treatment effects from observational data; and point out that, in general, only some factors based on the observed covariates X contribute to selection of the treatment T, and only some to determining the outcomes Y.

Similar to our work, [1] also proposed to decompose observed variables essentially into two subsets: confounding (referred to as $X$) and adjustment ($Z$) variables that are equivalent to our $\\Delta$ and $\\Upsilon$ factors. [1] then proposed an optimization algorithm to identify $X$ and $Z$ which were later used to find an unbiased estimate of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).\n\nHowever, there are several important differences between [1] and our proposed method:\n1. In addition to confounders and adjustment variables, we also identify the factors that determine the treatment and have no effect on the outcome; we refer to them as $\\Gamma$. Although such factors do induce selection bias, they should not be considered in re-weighting samples when trying to estimate counterfactual outcomes. Therefore, identifying these terms, and then explicitly removing their influence is important.\n2. Another major difference is that our proposed method facilitates estimating both ATE as well as Individual Treatment Effect (ITE). It is unclear, however, if [1] could provide estimates of ITEs since $h(U)$ does not accept treatment as its input.\n\nWe will certainly mention and cite [1] in our updated version of the paper and include a brief discussion on the similarities and differences.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper300/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Disentangled Representations for CounterFactual Regression", "authors": ["Negar Hassanpour", "Russell Greiner"], "authorids": ["hassanpo@ualberta.ca", "rgreiner@ualberta.ca"], "keywords": ["Counterfactual Regression", "Causal Effect Estimation", "Selection Bias", "Off-policy Learning"], "abstract": "We consider the challenge of estimating treatment effects from observational data; and point out that, in general, only some factors based on the observed covariates X contribute to selection of the treatment T, and only some to determining the outcomes Y.
