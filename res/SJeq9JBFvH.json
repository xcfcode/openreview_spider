The parameterization is used to simplify the subsampling distribution and ensure an expressive yet tractable distribution.  The new approach contribution is applied to  both reconstruction and classification tasks and demonstrated with a suite of experiments in a toy dataset, MINIST, and COFAR10.\n\n\nOverall, the paper requires significant improvement. \n\n1. The approach is not well justified either by theory or practice. There is no experiment clearly shows convincing evidence of the correctness of the proposed approach or its utility compared to existing approaches (Xie & Ermon (2019); Kool et al.

The paper is not nicely written or rather easy to follow. The model is not well motivated and the optimization algorithm is also not well described.\n\n4. A theoretical analysis of the convergence of the optimization algorithm could be needed.\n\n5. The paper is imprecise and unpolished and the presentation needs improvement.\n\n**There are so many missing details or questions to answer**\n\n1. What is the Gumbel-max trick? \n2. How to tune the parameters discussed in training details in the experiments?\n3. Why to use experience replay for the linear experiments?\n4.

We are happy to share that we have extended our experiments to include the recent competing method LOUPE from Bahadir et al. (2019). Other methods in traditional compressive sampling literature focus only on the reconstruction task and thus do not fit the full scope of our experiments. Besides, the algorithms typically used for this task, e.g. proximal gradient schemes, follow an iterative nature and are therefore less applicable for real-time applications. \nLastly, we argue that the fixed random subsampling pattern followed by an unfolded proximal gradient scheme for the CIFAR10 reconstruction case follows classical CS principles, in which partial Fourier measurements are used by an iterative proximal gradient scheme in order to reconstruct the original signal. We clearly see worse performance here compared to DPS, as a random pattern is still pseudo-random and therefore often still not able to prevent aliasing artifacts.\n\nWe agree that it is too strong a claim to say that DPS fully exploits the data distribution and information-need of a downstream task. We have reformulated this section to read \"to focus solely on the information required to solve the downstream task given the underlying data distribution\". We do not aim to claim that our method finds the global optimum in this situation, but rather focus on the empirical evidence that DPS performs well on a variety of tasks. We rely on the general accepted understanding that deep learning methods effectively discover patterns relevant to the supervised task. \nThough, we added a case in which we train MNIST reconstruction, followed by a separately trained classifier. This case confirms our hypothesize that task-adaptive learning is beneficial.\n\nAfter further tuning the parameters, and bringing DPS-topK better in line with the implementation of DPS-top1, we published new results on DPS-top1 and topK for all cases. The algorithmic description of DPS-top1 and DPS-topK is now added in appendix b as well. \n\nFinally we have extended our manuscript with a more elaborate description of the Gumbel-max trick (below eq. 4), and a definition of the probability distribution (footnote 1). Moreover, tables including all the layer parameters of the task networks (appendix c), and training curves demonstrating empirical convergence (appendix d) are added. We believe this should address all the concerns mentioned before.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing", "authors": ["Iris A.M.

Below we respond to these questions of the referee:\n\nQuestion 1:\nIn compressed sensing, RIP is indeed used to provide a measure for isometry when \u201crestricted\u201d to k columns, i.e. given a measurement $\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}$, of a k-sparse vector $\\mathbf{x}$. For many practical problems of interest, analysis of measurements of sparse vectors is achieved by reformulating the measurement as $\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\mathbf{x}$, with $\\mathbf{\\Psi}$ being a sparsifying basis, and $\\mathbf{z}=\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\mathbf{x}$ being the quantity of interest. Then, RIP should be evaluated for $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Psi}$. A common requirement posed for sparse bases is therefore incoherence of the columns. \n\nInstead, we here directly learn a mapping to $\\mathbf{z}$ from data, with no explicit notion of such a sparsifying basis. While this makes theoretical assessment more challenging, it alleviates the need for manual identification of a proper sparse basis for each new problem.\n\nWe augmented parts of the discussion of the revised manuscript to better reflect this. \n\nQuestion 2:\nThe reviewer raises a fundamental and interesting question regarding the typical loss surface in CS compared to the one of a neural network. Indeed the loss surface of a NN is highly non-linear and non-convex, it typically contains a vast amount of local minima, as a consequence of the weight space symmetry property (Goodfellow et al., 2016), i.e. having the same loss value for a different ordering of the same weights. The size of the gap between local and the global minima remains an open field of research. However, citing from Goodfellow et al. (2016):\n\u201cThe problem remains an active area of research, but experts now suspect that, for su\ufb03ciently large neural networks, most local minima have a low cost function value, and that it is not important to \ufb01nd a true global minimum rather than to \ufb01nd a point in parameter space that has low but not minimal cost (Saxe et al., 2013; Dauphin et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Choromanska et al., 2014)\u201d\n\nAs such, we leverage the empirically-shown ability of stochastic gradient descent to optimize this non-convex function. Indeed there are no global convergence guarantees, but we have the strong advantage compared to typical L1-reconstruction algorithms that we do not need explicit knowledge on the, in practice often unknown, sparsifying basis.\n\nWe followed standard practice in deep learning by  initializing all layers with their default Keras initializations, i.e. glorot uniform (Glorot, 2010), which we found to be working well. The logits of the distributions to be trained in the subsampling part of the network were initialized as a uniform, i.e. high-entropy, distribution, enabling most freedom for explorability of the sampling pattern by not explicitly setting a prior. \n\nWe now detail on the initializations for each layer in the appendix of the revised manuscript. \n\nQuestion 3:\nFor linear problems such as reconstruction, there is a clear relationship between the number of input data versus number of unknowns. In this paper we focus on non-linear reconstruction, as well as other tasks such as object classification. Under this scope, it becomes unclear if we can still consider problems to be over- or underdetermined from a traditional point of view, and a more general information theoretic standpoint might proof fruitful. Concretely, as deep learning methods are optimized stochastically, they are expected to be drawn towards solutions that carry the largest signal for the downstream task. In the face of redundant input samples and under pressure of a small number of output samples, the method is thus expected to randomly select just one of these redundant samples as this would improve the loss of the model. As some tentative evidence to support this claim, we would refer you to figure 2a (96.8% removed), where almost no directly neighbouring pixels are sampled, showing a clear preference of the model for skipping redundant samples."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing", "authors": ["Iris A.M.

The reviewer states in his/her summary: The parameterization is used to simplify the subsampling distribution. We would like to comment on this, by stating that the reparametrization is not used for simplifying the subsampling distribution; on the contrary it actually enables sampling from this trained distribution. In fact, without this reparametrization, our generative sampling model (DPS) would not be differentiable. Below we elaborate upon the questions and raised concerns by the reviewer:\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nWe respectfully disagree with the referee\u2019s conclusions, and will elaborate on the above statements in the following. While we disagree, we did however undertake a significant effort to further clarify and provide additional evidence in the revised manuscript, taking into account these comments.\n\nRegarding the theoretical correctness of deep probabilistic subsampling, in section 3.2 we explain how we incorporate a well-known reparametrization trick, termed the Gumbel-max trick (Gumbel,1954), to sample from a categorical probability distribution. Note that this shares similarities with the reparameterization trick used for sampling from trained gaussian distributions in a vanilla variational autoencoder. The Gumbel-max reparametrization perturbs the logits of the categorical distribution with Gumbel noise after which, by means of the argmax, the highest value is selected. Gumbel (1954) showed that this reparametrization allows sampling from the original categorical distribution. \nRecent state-of-the art work on a relaxation of this trick, termed Gumbel-softmax sampling (Jang et al., 2017) or the concrete distribution (Maddison et al., 2016), allows us to apply this relaxed reparametrization inside a neural network as it enables gradient calculation, which is needed for error backpropagation in the training procedure of the network. We would like to ask the reviewer what is believed to be missing from this explanation on the subsampling part of our proposed method. \n\nRegarding the theoretical basis used for the design of the task network; we took a theoretically principled approach by exploiting a model-driven network architecture for the CIFAR10 reconstruction problem. To that end, we unfold the iterations of a proximal gradient scheme (Mardani et al., NeurIPS, 2018), allowing for explicit embedding of the acquisition model (and therewith the learned sampling) in the reconstruction network.\n\nRegarding the referee\u2019s conclusion that the manuscript lacks comparison to the approaches of (Xie & Ermon (2019); Kool et al. (2019); Pl\u00f6tz & Roth (2018): We would like to point out that these three references all together put forward the Gumbel top-k method. Note that the use of the Gumbel top-k method for compressive sampling is also new, and in fact constitutes a specific case (constrained version with shared weights across distributions) of the proposed deep probabilistic subsampling (DPS) framework. In the MNIST experiments we already included Gumbel top-k sampling, but we will also add this for the other experiments in the revised manuscript. In addition, we added a thorough comparison of the DPS to LOUPE (Bahadir et al, 2019), a recently proposed data-driven method for subsampling.  \n\nQuestion 2:\nWe would first like to refer the referee to third paragraph of the introduction, where we explicitly formulate the main shortcoming of compressed sensing: \n\n\u201cThese [compressed sensing] methods, however, are lacking in the sense that they do not fully exploit both the underlying data distribution and information to solve the downstream task of interest.\u201d\n\nThen, in the list of main contributions, we write:\n\u201cDPS: A new regime for task-adaptive subsampling using a novel probabilistic deep learning framework for jointly learning a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme with a predictive model for downstream tasks\u201d\n\nSubquestion 2:\nWe are of course willing to further specify any details that the referee misses in the current paper. We would therefore like to kindly invite the referee to be specific about the details that he/she would like to be added to the manuscript. \n\nWe respectfully disagree with the referee\u2019s conclusion that the method does not support a significant contribution. We propose a fully-probabilistic generative model for trainable sampling, that exploits both the underlying data distribution and information to solve the downstream task of interest. Our generative model builds upon recent advances on Gumbel max and top-k reparameterizations and their relaxations, showing for the first time how discrete sample selection can be done in a data-driven and task-adaptive fashion. This opens up a vast array of new opportunities in compressed sensing. \n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing", "authors": ["Iris A.M.

The referee indicates (in sharp contrast to referee 3) that the paper is not nicely written, nor easy to follow. We invite the referee to be specific about the sections of the original manuscript that need more clarification, allowing us to revise these sections. \n\nQuestion 4:\nThe optimization algorithm used is the ADAM optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014). We refer to section 4 of Kingma & Ba (2014) for a proof of convergence for convex functions. It is known that that loss surfaces of deep neural networks are typically non-convex, however the gap between global and local minima is believed to be small for (see our answer to the referee\u2019s last question for more detail on this statement).  \n\nQuestion 5:\nWe kindly ask the reviewer to elaborate on the given statement. Could the reviewer indicate which sections are found to be imprecise and unpolished, and which parts of the manuscript need a better presentation? \n\n=====================================\nSecond part of the review\n=====================================\nQuestion 1: \nWe specify the Gumbel-max trick in the paragraph below equation 4. To make the paper more self-contained, we will extend this paragraph to further clarify the Gumbel-max trick.\nWe also refer to our answer to the first question of this referee, in which we elaborated more on the Gumbel-max trick as well.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAll training parameters were tuned empirically. However, we agree it is worth elaborating on our insights regarding the influence on performance of some of them. We experienced that performance was most sensitive to the learning rates for the sampling and task models, and the temperature parameter tau of the softmax relaxation. We augmented the discussion of our revised manuscript to share these insights. . \n\nQuestion 3:\nWe know experience replay as a reinforcement learning technique for storing previous state/action pairs. However, our method does not make use of reinforcement learning, so could the reviewer please elaborate how experience replay would relate to our method?\n\nQuestion 4:\nIn Section 4.1 (MNIST classification) we already compared our proposed sampling method to used Gumbel top-K sampling for data subsampling. We are currently also running experiments that allow for extensive comparison with the recently proposed LOUPE method by Bahadir et al. (2019).\n\nQuestion 5:\nA large part of the experiments in this work are focusing on compressive/partial Fourier measurements. This adequately reflects the measurement setup in many real-world problems, such as k-space measurement in magnetic resonance imaging (Lustig et al.), Xampling for ultrasound imaging (Eldar et al.), and non-uniform step frequency radar (Huang, 2014). In addition, we cover direct pixel sampling, related to real-world applications such as compressive cameras. We would like to emphasize that the proposed approach is measurement-domain agnostic, and therefore can be applied across a vast amount of real-world problem. \n\nIn addition, our ongoing research already shows promising results for real-world applications such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound imaging. This is part of future work. \n\nQuestion 6:\nThe trends towards using deep learning for data-driven compressed sensing indeed has the downside of not having guarantees on finding a global minimum, as the loss surface of a NN is highly non-linear and non-convex. Still, these data-driven results have shown to be very promising (Gregor et al., 2010; Jin,2019; Bahadir et al., 2019; Mousavi, 2019)\n\nHowever due to the weight space symmetry problem (Goodfellow et al., 2016) the loss surface contains a vast amount of local minima with the same error value. The size of the gap between local and the global minima remains an open field of research. However, citing from Goodfellow et al. (2016):\n\u201cThe problem remains an active area of research, but experts now suspect that,\nfor su\ufb03ciently large neural networks, most local minima have a low cost function\nvalue, and that it is not important to \ufb01nd a true global minimum rather than to\n\ufb01nd a point in parameter space that has low but not minimal cost (Saxe et al.,\n2013; Dauphin et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Choromanska et al., 2014)\u201d\n\nAs such, we leverage the empirically-shown ability of stochastic gradient descent to optimize this non-convex function in our NN for finding local minima. Indeed there is no guarantee on finding a global optimum. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing", "authors": ["Iris A.M.

The appropriate setting of these parameters is indeed important and we are happy to explain its impact on our outcomes. \n\nLambda is weighing the adherence to the data-consistency (via MSE error) and visual plausible images (via the cross-entropy discriminator loss). For higher lambda, the discriminator loss is weighted more heavily, and as such, more effort is done by the model to create visually plausible natural images, as they appear in the CIFAR10 database. A balance should be found here, as a too high lambda can cause image predictions that look rather natural, however do not resemble the target image.\n\nThe mu parameter weights the influence of the entropy penalty during training of the logits in the categorical distributions. For higher mu, the distributions converge quicker towards low entropy distributions, i.e. one class has a probability close to 1, as high entropy is highly penalized. There is a tradeoff here between quick convergence and explorability. When the distributions converge really quickly, the model has no chance to explore different subsampling patterns and as such will probably find subsampling patterns that are not useful \nfor the downstream task. However, setting mu too low, can easily slow down convergence of the whole model.\n\nAs suggested by the referee, we will detail on the above in our revised manuscript.\n\nQuestion 5:\nThanks for pointing out this typo, 70,000 is the total number of datapoints that we used, of which 60,000 were used for training.

Below we answer the questions and concerns:\n\nQuestion 1:\nWe agree with the referee and will therefore include a visualization of the trained distributions using Gumbel top-k sampling and a realization of the sampling pattern. We are currently running experiments to obtain Gumbel top-k results for the \u2018lines and circles\u2019 and CIFAR10 experiments as well. \n\nSince we did not sufficiently emphasize that leveraging Gumbel top-k sampling for learning signal subsampling matrices is part of the novelty of the present work, we clarified this in the revised manuscript. In fact, using Gumbel top-k sampling in this context can be seen as a constrained version of DPS, with shared weights across the M distributions. \n\nTo also include previously-published baselines, we are currently running experiments with the recently proposed LOUPE method by Bahadir et al. (2019).\n\nQuestion 2:\nIndeed, the notion of compressed sensing has spurred vast work, ranging from sensing strategies to signal recovery algorithms. On the sensing side, sampling strategies are typically designed to satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP); describing isometry of the sensing matrix given K-sparse vectors, and thereby providing signal recovery guarantees, given an appropriate algorithm. On the algorithm side, sparsity in some basis transform is typically exploited, leveraging a wide variety of optimization algorithms spanning from proximal gradient methods to projection-over-convex-set and greedy algorithms. More recently, deep learning methods have been proposed for fast signal recovery from CS measurements, yielding state-of-the-art results.  \n\nIn this context, DPS adopts current practices in data-driven CS recovery, but extends this to incorporate subsampling (the sensing) in an end-to-end pipeline. Such an end-to-end (sampling-to-any-task) learning strategy opens up opportunities for data-driven optimization of sensing strategies beyond theoretically-established results. \n\nAs pointed out by the referee, the shortcomings of disjoint optimization in classical CS are perhaps most evident when high-level tasks such as classification are part of the pipeline.  \nAs such, we are currently running additional experiments to better illustrate this. \n\nQuestion 3:\nWe agree with the reviewer that such a comparison might be of interest. \n\nAs such, we are currently running additional experiments to include a comparison to Gumbel top-k (as we did for the MNIST classification case) as well as the method proposed by Bahadir et al. (2019). Notably, and unlike our method, the latter approach does not permit setting a specific subsampling rate, with this rate is only being indirectly controlled via hyperparameter settings. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing", "authors": ["Iris A.M.

How does the new method relate to such theoretical results? Are the results and findings along similar lines as (classical) compressed sensing theory? \n\n- Methods in compressed sensing are typically convex, e.g. using l1-regularization. What are the drawbacks of using deep learning in this context, e.g. related to non-convexity? What is the role of initialization?\n\n- Does the method both work for underdetermined and overdetermined problems (number of data versus number of unknowns)?\n\n- What is the influence of the hyper-parameters mu and lambda in eq (14)? How should the model selection be done (currently lambda is set to 0.004 without further motivation)? \n\n- MNIST: 60,000 instead of 70,000?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1887/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep probabilistic subsampling for task-adaptive compressed sensing", "authors": ["Iris A.M.
