But trivially adding it in the objective function does not help. Adding this additional information to previous state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques like evolutionary algorithm and GVAE leads to poor results. Even adding it directly to MCTS performs worse. One key contribution of our paper is to develop a new mechanism to do it efficiently. We show that our technique works significant well compared to previous state of the art symbolic regression techniques (GVAE, evolutionary techniques, MCTS).\n\nSecond, in the paper, for a family of rational expressions, we use \u201cleading power\u201d as an example of the global property that is difficult to incorporate by hard constraint on local syntactic structure or numerical points. This kind of property is very helpful for expression discovery in natural sciences by human experts (see list of examples in the previous response). But there is no efficient way to incorporate this kind of knowledge in symbolic regression. Rather than hypothesizing after the results are known, we present a mechanism to successfully incorporate such knowledge.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that we would like to enable scientists to discover new laws using our framework, but we believe NG-MCTS is already a significant improvement over state of the art symbolic regression techniques on thousands of complex regression tasks.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural-Guided Symbolic Regression with Asymptotic Constraints", "authors": ["Li Li", "Minjie Fan", "Rishabh Singh", "Patrick Riley"], "authorids": ["leeley@google.com", "mjfan@google.com", "rising@google.com", "pfr@google.com"], "keywords": ["symbolic regression", "program synthesis", "monte carlo tree search"], "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a type of discrete optimization problem that involves searching expressions that fit given data points.

These assume CFGs because the target problem is generating (grammatically valid) SMILES strings representing chemical molecules. In these lines of research, we have many other examples (For example, see a review paper in Science (2018) DOI: 10.1126/science.aat2663).\n\nSo the points of the paper would be (1) applications of these strategies to symbolic regression (SR) tasks, and (2) taking into account additional 'asymptotic constraints' in SR tasks. My points (1) and (2) also correspond to these two.\n\nFor (1), I raised a question about how valid applying these grammar-based methods to symbolic regression tasks (that try to uncover hidden natural laws presumably?) is, whereas situations that GVAE and SD-VAE assumed had natural motivations and real-world datasets. Experiments on synthetic datasets would provide limited practical values on any representation learning on these hidden natural laws. (Any real-world datasets available?)\n\nFor (2), I understood these include many examples, but again, can this constraint be validated using any not-synthetic datasets? Adding more information on the ground truth improves prediction performance would be not surprising, and how can we get such information when we try to apply SR to \"yet unseen natural laws\" where it would be hard to assume anything beforehand? In this paper's experiments, we can consider these 'asymptotic constraints' because the datasets are synthetic and we already know the ground truths. This sounds a bit like a HARKing (hypothesizing after the results are known) situation.\n\nI (groundlessly...) assumed that SR is not so familiar for the ICLR readers, and making clear these validities would help us to understand the paper's scientific contributions.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural-Guided Symbolic Regression with Asymptotic Constraints", "authors": ["Li Li", "Minjie Fan", "Rishabh Singh", "Patrick Riley"], "authorids": ["leeley@google.com", "mjfan@google.com", "rising@google.com", "pfr@google.com"], "keywords": ["symbolic regression", "program synthesis", "monte carlo tree search"], "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a type of discrete optimization problem that involves searching expressions that fit given data points.

The search space includes mathematical building blocks such as algebraic operators {+, -, *, /}, variables and constants. Using CFG is one common way to define such an infinite search space. We would like to note that the evolutionary algorithm based symbolic regression also can only search within the search space. If the search search does not have {*, /}, it will not be able to find the target expression with {*, /}. \n\nDepending on the algorithm, the expression can be represented in different ways. For example, Schmidt & Lipson (2009) represents an expression as a graph where the operators are nodes. GVAE (Kusner et al., 2017) represents an expression as a tree of CFG production rules. Any sets of operators in evolutionary algorithm based symbolic regression can be represented by CFG.\n\nWe improved the presentation to make it more explicit why we train a neural network before the MCTS based search, while most symbolic regression algorithms search for expressions directly.\n\n    (a) We only sample a small fraction of expressions in the space to train the network. The network is designed to learn the relation between syntactic structure and leading powers, which can generalize to larger space and higher leading powers. The network is not designed to memorize the expressions in the space. Actually, memorization hurts the generalization tremendously outside of training space, see Full History (FH) and Full History No Condition (FHNC) in Table 3.\n    (b) Our experiments show that our method can generalize to unseen leading powers (M[f] > 4) in larger space than the space considered during training (M[f] <= 4). The neural network can guide the search efficiently even when the target expression is not in the space of training expressions.\n\nUnlike previous works in symbolic regression that only evaluate the technique on few tens of mathematical expressions (e.g. 1 in the case of GVAE), we evaluate our technique on thousands of expressions of varying complexity both with conditions seen in training (M[f]<=4) and conditions that do not exist in training set (M[f]>4). We hope our large evaluation benchmark dataset would become a more standard practice in symbolic regression community, so that one can better evaluate the benefits and shortcomings of different techniques.\n\n(2) Although using asymptotic constraints to derive mathematical formulas is common for physicists and mathematicians, it may not be as familiar for researchers in machine learning community. Besides the heat capacity (T^3) and gravitational field (1/r) examples in the introduction, there are many more real-world practical settings where such information is available. For example,\n    * London dispersion force (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_dispersion_force) is a force between atoms and molecules (with force decreasing with separation R as 1/R^3 or 1/R^6 depending on the type of matters). The expression of it is constructed by the asymptotic decay of the interactions.\n    * In density functional theory, Kato theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kato_theorem) states that the electron density has a cusp at the position of the nuclei. This asymptotic behavior at zero radius is essential to construct the density and density functional.\n    * In differential equations, asymptotic analysis is used to get the trial solutions and to determine some of the coefficients.\n    * In defining kernels for stationary Gaussian random fields, the value of kernel need to decay to zero when the distance of two locations increases to infinity.\n\nThe key idea of our paper is to present the first mechanism to condition the expression generating model with additional information, of which \u201cleading power\u201d is an example in the symbolic regression domain, and then using it to guide search more effectively in MCTS. As discussed in the paper, we believe this framework can generalize to additional expression properties, as well as other domains such as program synthesis where such properties might include the expected time complexity of the desired programs or maximum loop nesting.\n\nWe hope the above clarifications addressed your concerns and we will be happy to discuss more if there are more questions or comments.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural-Guided Symbolic Regression with Asymptotic Constraints", "authors": ["Li Li", "Minjie Fan", "Rishabh Singh", "Patrick Riley"], "authorids": ["leeley@google.com", "mjfan@google.com", "rising@google.com", "pfr@google.com"], "keywords": ["symbolic regression", "program synthesis", "monte carlo tree search"], "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a type of discrete optimization problem that involves searching expressions that fit given data points.

We apologize for the confusion on the framing of this work and appreciate the opportunity to clarify.\n\nThere are two main components in our framework:\n\nThe first component is a neural network that is trained to generate production rules to construct expressions that are consistent with a given pair of leading powers. This network learns the relation between syntactic structure and semantic prior (leading powers). Note that the numerical points are not used in this component.\n\nThe second component is the MCTS algorithm that searches for an expression consistent with a given set of input-output numerical points. This second component uses the neural network from the first component to guide the search process more effectively.\n\n1. The neural network does not generate expression directly. It is used to guide the search algorithm to the subspace with desired property (leading powers in this case).  The training dataset of (partial sequence, leading power, next production rule) is randomly sampled from the full production rule sequences of 28837 expressions, and contains the relation between syntactic structure and leading powers. Since we use a small fraction of expressions in the space for training the network, random sampling ensures that we obtain samples that best represent the distributions of possible combinations of (partial sequence, leading power, next production rule).\n\nFor inference, the neural network generates production rules auto-regressively to construct expressions, by predicting a sequence of production rules starting from the start symbol until all the leaf nodes in the constructed parse tree of the expression are terminal (as described in the first paragraph in Section 5.3). The network favors the subspace of expressions with desired leading powers. This results in making MCTS more efficient to find expressions that fit the data points and have the desired leading powers.\n\n2. For training the neural network, the training objective is minimizing the cross-entropy loss. We have a training set of (leading powers, expression) dataset, which is used to construct the corresponding dataset of (partial sequence, leading powers, next production rule). The network takes as input the leading powers and the sequence of production rules corresponding to the partial expression, and learns to generate the next production rule. It is formulated as a multi-class classification problem.\n\nAfter training the neural network, we use MCTS for searching the expression that fits a given set of data points. It tries to minimize the RMSE on training points and the absolute difference between the desired leading powers and leading powers of the current expression as the objective function.\n\n3. We agree with the importance of providing a fair set of baselines.\n\nTable 1 includes baseline approaches with the additional leading power information (MCTS+PW, EA+PW, and GVAE+PW). NG-MCTS (71.22% solved) significantly outperforms these baselines with the same information: EA+PW (23.27%), MCTS+PW (0.2%) and GVAE+PW (10%) for M[f]<=4, and similarly for other cases with M[f]=5 and M[f]=6.\n\n4. Ablations can provide important insight into how to attribute the improved performance. We included several ablations in the experiments on the two main components in our framework:\n\n    (a) For the neural network that learns to generate grammar production rules conditioned on leading powers, we evaluate models with No Condition (NNNC), Random, Full History (FH), Full History No Condition (FHNC), Limited History (LH), and Limited History No Condition (LHNC) in Section 5.3.\n\n    (b) For the MCTS, we compare MCTS with full information (points and leading power) , MCTS with only leading power information (MCTS (PW-only)),  and MCTS with only the data points. We perform similar ablations for EA and GVAE.\n\nAll these ablations show the importance of training the neural network on leading powers, and the MCTS that is guided by the neural network model.\n\nWe hope the above clarifications addressed your concerns and we will be happy to discuss more if there are more questions or comments.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural-Guided Symbolic Regression with Asymptotic Constraints", "authors": ["Li Li", "Minjie Fan", "Rishabh Singh", "Patrick Riley"], "authorids": ["leeley@google.com", "mjfan@google.com", "rising@google.com", "pfr@google.com"], "keywords": ["symbolic regression", "program synthesis", "monte carlo tree search"], "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a type of discrete optimization problem that involves searching expressions that fit given data points.

For example, when the groundtruth expression is 3 x^2 + 5 x, it behaves like x^2 in the limit x -> infinity, thus the power '2' is given as additional information 'asymptotic constraint'. In the paper's setting, for SR with univariate groundtruth functions f(x), 'asymptotic constraints' for x-> infinity and x -> 0 are given. For this situation, the paper proposes a method called NG-MCTS with an RNN-based generator and MCTS guided by it to consider asymptotic constraints. In SR, a learner is asked to acquire an explicit symbolic expression \\hat{f}(x) from a given set of datapoints {x_i, f(x_i)}, but unlike the parameter optimization aspect of a standard supervised ML setting, the problem is essentially combinatorial optimization over exponentially large space of symbolic expressions of a given context-free grammar (CFG). For a given symbolic space with a prespecified CFG, extensive experimental evaluations are performed and demonstrated significant performance gain over existing alternatives based on EA. Also, quantitative evaluations about extrapolative performance and detailed evaluation of the RNN generator are also reported.\n\nThough it includes a lot of quite interesting methods and results, the paper has two major issues: \n\n(1) the proposed method NG-MCTS explicitly uses the fact that the target expressions are generated from a CFG, but this assumption sounds unnatural if the target problem is SR (unlike the case of GVAE). Apparently, all results except a toy case study in 5.2 depend on artificial datasets from a CFG, and any practical advantages or impacts are still unclear because the experimental settings are very artificial. \n\n(2) the most important claim of this paper would be the proposal to use 'asymptotic constraints', but the availability of this information sounds too strong and again artificial in practical situations. A one-line motivation saying that 'this property is known a priori for some physical systems before the detailed law is derived' is not convincing enough."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper872/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural-Guided Symbolic Regression with Asymptotic Constraints", "authors": ["Li Li", "Minjie Fan", "Rishabh Singh", "Patrick Riley"], "authorids": ["leeley@google.com", "mjfan@google.com", "rising@google.com", "pfr@google.com"], "keywords": ["symbolic regression", "program synthesis", "monte carlo tree search"], "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a type of discrete optimization problem that involves searching expressions that fit given data points.
