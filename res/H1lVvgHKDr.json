The proposed method concatenate the first a few layers of the student network with the last a few layers of the teacher network, and claims the gradient directly flows from teacher to student, instead of through a KL or L2 similarity loss between teacher and student logits. \n\nThe experimental results look good, and extensive experiments have been done on CIFAR, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC. \n\nHowever, the description of the proposed method looks rather unclear. First, the \u2018front\u2019 and \u2018back\u2019 part of networks are very vague. I have to guess that is the first a few layers of student and last a few layers of teacher. And it is still unclear how many layers in student and teacher are concatenated to form the \u2018collaboration network\u2019. How could the authors connect the two subnetwork with different structures?\n\nIt is unclear to me why proposed method is better than AT, FT or FitNets. It looks to me the proposed method use an ad-hoc selected layer to transfer knowledge from teacher to student, and the transfer is indirect because it has to go through the pre-trained subnetwork in teacher.\n\nMinor issue, FT and AT are not defined when they first appear in page 1. \n\nCould the authors show the student and teacher accurayunder standard supervised training in the result tables?\n\nSeveral related works are not discussed, such as\nXu et al. 2018 https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00513\nBelagiannis et al. 2018 https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10750\nWang et al. 2018 https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7358-kdgan-knowledge-distillation-with-generative-adversarial-networks\n\n\n============ after rebuttal ================\nI updated my rate to weak accept. Though it is a borderline or below paper to me. The paper has really good empirical results. However, I cannot understand the intuition behind the paper why concatenating teacher to student is better than use l2 for intermediate layers. The choice of the transferring layer seems to be rather ad-hoc, and it is hard to say how much tuning needed to get the empirical benefits.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2357/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2357/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["gtx@pku.edu.cn", "rqxiong@pku.edu.cn", "liu-zh@pku.edu.cn", "swma@pku.edu.cn", "fengwu@ustc.edu.cn", "tjhuang@pku.edu.cn", "wgao@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Knowledge Transfer via Student-Teacher Collaboration", "authors": ["Tianxiao Gao", "Ruiqin Xiong", "Zhenhua Liu", "Siwei ma", "Feng Wu", "Tiejun Huang", "Wen Gao"], "pdf": "/pdf/766e9dfd3ffa063ac47fd4f320af23fadcaffeab.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel knowledge transfer method which employs a student-teacher collaboration network.", "abstract": "Accompanying with the flourish development in various fields, deep neural networks, however, are still facing with the plight of high computational costs and storage.

We have modified our claims and improved our literature survey based on your comments. Here are our responses to your major concerns.\n\nQ: To reduce model size, there are several different ways including efficient architecture design, parameter pruning, quantization, tensor decomposition and knowledge distillation. The authors forgot to mention tensor decomposition and mixed it with efficient architecture design. As for parameter pruning and quantization, many important papers are missing. \n\nA: We apologize for the unclear description in our \u201cRelated Work\u201d section and have improved the literature survey based on your suggestions in the updated version of our paper. Due to the page limitation mentioned in ICLR submission instructions, some of the related works can only be described briefly in our article. We hope to get your understanding.\n\nQ: Utilizing the \"soft targets\" to transfer knowledge from teacher to student model is not first proposed by Hinton et al. (2015). To the best of my knowledge, it is first proposed in J. Li, R. Zhao, J.-T. Huang, Y. Gong, \u201cLearning small-size DNN with output-distribution-based criteria,\u201d Proc. Interspeech-2014, pp.1910-1914.\n\nA: In paper \u201cLearning small-size DNN with output-distribution-based criteria\u201d, authors took the KL divergence between the posterior probabilities produced by the softmax operation from student and teacher model as loss function for knowledge transfer. Hinton et al. (2015) improved the posterior probability from teacher network by employing the softmax function on the teacher logits with temperature T and called it as \u201csoft target\u201d. The definition of \u201csoft target\u201d in our paper is the same as in Hinton\u2019s. In other knowledge transfer methods, such as FitNet, AT and FT, the definition of \u201csoft target\u201d is the same as ours. We have cited the prior paper in the updated version.\n\nQ: Leveraging back part of teacher model's guidance to improve student performance has been investigated by other researchers on OCR tasks in Ding H, Chen K, Huo Q. Compressing CNN-DBLSTM models for OCR with teacher-student learning and Tucker decomposition[J]. Pattern Recognition, 2019, 96: 106957. They combine student's CNN with teacher's DBLSTM to learn better representations.\n\nA: We are sorry for missing this paper in our literature survey. However, our work started half a year ago, while this paper is published on July 7, 2019. We have cited this paper in the updated version of our paper.\nIn paper \u201cCompressing CNN-DBLSTM models for OCR with teacher-student learning and Tucker decomposition\u201d, authors employed a knowledge distillation method with DarkNet-DBLSTM as student network and VGG-DBLSTM as teacher network. The DBLSTM modules of the student and teacher networks in this paper have same topology, so the student\u2019s BLSTM and inner product layers can borrow parameters from the teacher\u2019s counterparts during training and inference. In contrast, the student networks in our proposed method do not take any part of teacher network for inference and the back part of the teacher network is only employed during the training process. Therefore, our method can be generalized to situations where the student network and the teacher network have different structure. Besides, our method can also be applied to different tasks, which has been confirmed through our experiments.\n\n\nBest regards, \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2357/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2357/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["gtx@pku.edu.cn", "rqxiong@pku.edu.cn", "liu-zh@pku.edu.cn", "swma@pku.edu.cn", "fengwu@ustc.edu.cn", "tjhuang@pku.edu.cn", "wgao@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Knowledge Transfer via Student-Teacher Collaboration", "authors": ["Tianxiao Gao", "Ruiqin Xiong", "Zhenhua Liu", "Siwei ma", "Feng Wu", "Tiejun Huang", "Wen Gao"], "pdf": "/pdf/766e9dfd3ffa063ac47fd4f320af23fadcaffeab.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel knowledge transfer method which employs a student-teacher collaboration network.", "abstract": "Accompanying with the flourish development in various fields, deep neural networks, however, are still facing with the plight of high computational costs and storage.

In our method, the student sub-network is all the front part of a selected layer of the student network and teacher sub-network is all the subsequent layers of teacher network corresponding to the selected layer. The definition of the corresponding layers is mentioned in the updated version of our paper and the description of our proposed method have been modified, which can be seen on page 4.  For cases that the intermediate representation from the student sub-network has different number of channels with the teacher sub-network, a simple convolutional layer is employed to transform the dimension. We have pointed this out in the first paragraph of Sec. 4.1. in the updated version of our paper. \n\nFor your other concerns, here are our responses:\n\nQ: It is unclear to me why proposed method is better than AT, FT or FitNets. It looks to me the proposed method use an ad-hoc selected layer to transfer knowledge from teacher to student, and the transfer is indirect because it has to go through the pre-trained subnetwork in teacher.\n\nA: Our theory is described in Sec. 3.2. The gradient signal of the teacher sub-network plays a role of weight parameters in the backward propagation formula, which indicates that the teacher network provides guidance to the student network on which element in the weights of student network should be paid more attention to during the training process. For the previous methods, they transfer the knowledge by minimizing the loss between the intermediate representations from student and teacher network. However, due to the divergence of the structure between the student and teacher networks, the student network cannot generate the total same intermediate representation as the teacher network. In this case, these methods are not able to determine which element in the weights of student network need to be paid more attention to during the training process.\n\nQ: Minor issue, FT and AT are not defined when they first appear in page 1.\n\nA: The corresponding illustrations of AT and FT are mentioned in page 1. In order to reduce the redundancy of the article, we describe the AT and FT methods briefly in page 1 and define these two methods in page 2. \n\nQ: Could the authors show the student and teacher accuracy under standard supervised training in the result tables?\n\nA: For all the experiment results in our paper, the value in the parentheses after the network\u2019s type is the\naccuracy of student and teacher network under standard supervised training.\n\nQ: Several related works are not discussed\n\nA: The related works you mentioned have been included in our updated version.

The idea is that teacher not only provides student with the correct answer or correct intermediate representation, but also instructs student network on how to get the right answer. The paper suggests to merge the front part of the student network and back part of the teacher network into the collaboration network. In this way, the weights in the student subnetwork are learned from the loss backpropagated from the teacher subnetwork. The target labels for collaboration network are outputs of teacher network. The method is adapted for different tasks, classification and bounding box regression are presented in the experiments. It outperforms previous methods on various datasets. Furthermore, the method shows good results when integrated with traditional knowledge distillation.\n\nOverall, the paper is a significant algorithmic contribution. The related work section provides thorough review of different methods to decrease computational costs, including not only knowledge distillation, but also pruning, compressing and decomposition approaches. The idea is elegant and, to the best of my knowledge, has never been suggested in other works. Considering the theoretical part, it is clearly shown how the gradient signal from the teacher sub-network guides the student network on which part of the weights should be paid attention on. All derivations are easy to follow. The paper also considers how the suggested idea is aimed to solve the problems of previous knowledge transfer methods. The experimental section is consistent and clearly shows the advantage of the suggested method. Teacher and student networks used are different sizes of ResNet, Wide ResNet and VGG. The paper presents classification experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet and object detection experiment on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. STC outperforms previous methods, both with KD integration and without. The performance is always better than pure student training (which was not always the case for previous methods) and sometimes the results are even better than teacher performance. Finally, the choice of teacher output as target over soft target and ground truth, which was previously motivated in the theoretical section, is shown to be superior in the experiment.\n\nPossible improvement of the paper is the instruction on how to choose the intermediate layer from where to teach the representation, i.e. where the student sub-network ends and teacher sub-network begins. For object detection experiment the choice of the border is naturally defined by the architecture of the network in Faster-RCNN approach. Could the choice be different? May be somewhere inside the BackBone part of the networks? For classification, it could be interesting to study how this choice influences the results.
