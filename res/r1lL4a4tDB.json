We posted a revised version according to the reviews, and here we shortly introduce what has been modified:\n\n1. The original Fig.1 has been divided into two (now Fig.1 and Fig.2) for clarity.  \n2. We added a new section 5.4 to discuss how convergence of the keep-learning VRM affect policy improvement.\n3. We added Appendix F to empirically show the effect of hyperparameters of the VRMs on RL, which showed the representation learning part (training the VRMs) of our algorithm is robust to hyperparameters.\n4. The scalability was explained in Appendix G.\n\nAlso some minor modifications on improving clarity and citing references.\n\n\n(* Update after acceptance. *)\nWe thank the reviewers and the chairs for their time and efforts on reviewing our paper!  We here would like to clarify a mistake/typo in the figure descriptions we just found: In Fig.3 caption, we wrote \"Shaded areas indicate 95% confidence interval.\". However, it is actually \u201cS.E.M.\u201d instead of \u201c95% confidence interval\u201d (assuming Gaussian).  We are sorry for this mistake and have fixed it in the latest camera-ready version.\n\nAlso, the codes of our algorithm are now accessible at ( https://github.com/oist-cnru/Variational-Recurrent-Models ).\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dongqi.han@oist.jp", "doya@oist.jp", "jun.tani@oist.jp"], "title": "Variational Recurrent Models for Solving Partially Observable Control Tasks", "authors": ["Dongqi Han", "Kenji Doya", "Jun Tani"], "pdf": "/pdf/008bf8ee5b9f826cd28cccde848cfe092052030e.pdf", "TL;DR": "A deep RL algorithm for solving POMDPs by auto-encoding the underlying states using a variational recurrent model", "abstract": "In partially observable (PO) environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from unsatisfactory performance, since two problems need to be tackled together: how to extract information from the raw observations to solve the task, and how to improve the policy.

Intuitively the decomposition makes sense, though it's not very clear to me that the problems encountered training a recurrent agent should be dramatically simpler when training a recurrent world model instead.\n\nFor the world model the paper proposes using a variational recurrent state-transition model, which is essentially a VRNN which also conditions on the actions. It is not clear to me that this is easier to learn than a recurrent agent because the probability distribution of the data used to train the modified VRNN is highly dependent on the current policy in the same way that the non-iid training data makes it tricky for the RNN policy models to converge.\n\nWhile the experimental results seem to show the new algorithm outperforming the existing ones over a large set of random seeds the paper does not specify how the fixed hyperparameters for all models were chosen, leaving open the possibility that different hyperparameter settings would have shown reversals in the experimental results. It's also not clear that the complexity of the alternate models was adequately accounted for (specially since two VRNNs are required to match the performance of a single RNN agent). That said the incompleteness of the experimental results is my only reservation against accepting this paper.\n\n\n----\n\nThe author response somewhat addressed my major concern, which was the lack of hyperparameter tuning in the baselines, as well as clarifying some of the other questions I had.

Hope the following explanations can address your (and maybe also other readers\u2019) concerns about our claims and results. \n\n\n>>> It's not very clear to me that the problems encountered training a recurrent agent should be dramatically simpler when training a recurrent world model instead. It is not clear to me that this is easier to learn than a recurrent agent because the probability distribution of the data used to train the modified VRNN is highly dependent on the current policy in the same way that the non-iid training data makes it tricky for the RNN policy models to converge.\n\nAs you said, the data used to train the variational recurrent model (VRM) depends on the agent\u2019s policy and can be non-iid. However, the VRMs actually are trained by unsupervised learning given the observations and actions. If we assume a VRM is perfectly trained, it should be able to represent the environment regardless the agent\u2019s policy, because state-transitions condition on action, not policy (definition of POMDP).  \nOur method is expected to outperform a recurrent agent because most RL algorithms (dynamic programming approaches, such as SAC) are bootstrapping (\u201cAll of them update estimates of the values of states based on estimates of the values of successor states. That is, they update estimates on the basis of other estimates.\u201d [Sutton 2018, page 89]). So if a recurrent agent directly learns to represent reward-related state-transitions environments by learning value functions, it may suffer from a biased target due to imperfectly learned value functions. We proposed to solve the representation learning problem by unsupervised learning using the agent\u2019s state-transition data, which is non-bootstrapping and is expected to be easier. \nAs for the convergence problem, you are right, it is tricky to for a VRM to converge if policy changes (We guess you mean the VRM by \u201cRNN policy model\u201d since we do not have a RNN policy model.) This is why we proposed two VRMs, the first-impression model (FIM) and the keep-learning model (KLM), as addressed in the last 2 paragraphs in Section 4.1.  The FIM should converge given fixed policy before the RL begins. The KLM is not guaranteed to converge quickly because the agent keeps improve its policy and novel state-transition samples can appear. However, the KLM should also converge after the agent\u2019s policy converged. \nTo empirically investigate how convergence of the KLM affect policy improvement, we revised the paper by adding corresponding results and discussions in Section 5.4 (as you can download from the current webpage). We hope the new Section 5.4 can help to address this concern.\n\n\n>>> The paper does not specify how the fixed hyperparameters for all models were chosen, leaving open the possibility that different hyperparameter settings would have shown reversals in the experimental results.\n\nThis is actually a good point! It was our mistake not to mention how we selected hyperparameters, which causes concerns because this is indeed important in RL. Let us explain: our algorithm has two parts, the VRMs and the RL controller.\nFor the RL controller, we did not tune the hyperparameters. The hyperparameters (Table 1) were exactly the same as used in the original SAC paper [Haarnoja 2018]. Sensitivity to hyperparameters of SAC were discussed in SAC papers. We think it is reasonable to follow their proposed hyperparameters and it is fair to compare with the alternative methods using the same RL hyperparameters.\nFor the VRMs, since this representation learning problem is non-bootstrapping, hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size should not affect too much as long as the ELBO is correctly estimated (of course, too small learning rate will slow down learning). Importantly, we used the same hyperparameters to all the experiments.\nFor simplicity, we used the same hyperparameters for both the FIM and KLM (Table 2), which were selected intuitively. We selected a larger learning rate (8e-4 > 3e-4 for RL) and a lower training frequency (0.2 < 1 for RL) for the VRM to save computation cost. \n\n(*Updated Nov 15th*)\nWe have performed experiments to investigate the effect of hyperparameters for the VRMs and the results was discussed in Appendix F. The overall performance of our algorithm did not significantly change using different, random hyperparameters of the VRMs (Fig.10 in the revised paper). \n\nWe also have added a short explanation of how we selected hyperparameters in the first paragraph of Section 5 of the revised paper.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dongqi.han@oist.jp", "doya@oist.jp", "jun.tani@oist.jp"], "title": "Variational Recurrent Models for Solving Partially Observable Control Tasks", "authors": ["Dongqi Han", "Kenji Doya", "Jun Tani"], "pdf": "/pdf/008bf8ee5b9f826cd28cccde848cfe092052030e.pdf", "TL;DR": "A deep RL algorithm for solving POMDPs by auto-encoding the underlying states using a variational recurrent model", "abstract": "In partially observable (PO) environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from unsatisfactory performance, since two problems need to be tackled together: how to extract information from the raw observations to solve the task, and how to improve the policy.

We here discuss about them as follows.\n\n\n>>> It is not clear whether all components are needed. For example, why z and d need to be distinguished?\n\nWe adopted the network design mostly from the original VRNN implementation [Chung 2015]. except that we added an action feedback connection to address the effect of action on state-transition. This \u201cdistinguished z and d\u201d setting was also suggested and used by the original VRNN [Chung 2015] paper and many other related works [Shabanian 2017].  The reason is because we need abundant #neurons for expressive power, but we do not want #parameters to be too large. Since z is stochastic variable, there will be much more #parameters (like $\\mu_z, \\sigma_z$) if the dimension of z is large, but we actually do not need that many of stochastic units. So \u201cmore d and less z\u201d appears as a solution considering this tradeoff. \n\n\n>>> In (7),(8) are the expectations over the same state / actions or different? The notation is not clear about it. \n\nThanks for pointing out this confusion. For (5)~(8), $s_t$ is the same, sampled from the replay buffer. \nFor (7), action is reparametrized (indicated by $a_\\eta$) to compute the gradients.  This can result in a lower variance estimator, according to the SAC paper [Haarnoja 2018]\nBut for (8), no gradient is needed on action (indicated by $a$), so action is just treated as a constant.   \nWe\u2019ve added explanations to clarify this in the revised version of the paper (you can download from the current webpage)\n\n>>> After (2), given $x_t$ and $d_{t-1}$ instead of $d_t$?\n\nDo you mean $[\\mu_{z,t}, \\sigma^2_{z,t}] = f^{encoder} (x_t, d_{t-1})$ ? This is because $z_t$ needs to be computed before $d_t$ in the inference model, which is the default design of VRNN.\n\n\n>>> \u2026 In the end, is a good generative model to predict the future observation needed or not needed in this approach?\n\nLet us consider the \u201cPendulum-no velocities\u201d task: Suppose the model cannot accurately predict future observation, but its hidden states can infer whether the pendulum is moving clockwise or counter-clockwise. In this case, the RL controller should be able to acquire a near-optimal policy. Therefore, we consider that a good model is needed to [encode critical information of the environment for control] rather than [to accurately predict future observations/rewards], and the former can be achieved by learning to do the latter (maximizing ELBO).\nHowever, it is hard to evaluated how good the encoding is without decoding. So we could only show Fig.7 (Fig. 9 in the revised version) to partially address this question. It can be seen that the model for Pendulum-no velocities was not satisfying, while this task still could  be well learned. \nAlso, we added a section (5.4) in the revised paper to demonstrate that policy can be improved before the keep-learning VRM fully converges. This suggests that while a good generative model to predict future observations is beneficial, sometimes it is not necessary for the purpose of enhancing control skills. \n\n\n\n>>> The exploration seems to be addressed just by randomizing the policy, are there any better options?\n\nIn our work, we used the default exploration strategy of SAC and many other RL algorithms for continuous control, in which action follows a (parameterized) Gaussian distribution. We did so since we wanted to focus on discussion the benefits of VRM, but not RL algorithm.\nHowever, this is a great point. There are a number of interesting studies on a better exploration strategy for RL, such as temporally-correlated noise [Lillicrap 2015], and noisy neural networks for exploration [Fortunato 2017]. Our future study may consider using deterministic node for action, while the stochasticity necessary for exploration is provided by the random variable z. This may lead to a higher-level exploration and it should be interesting to see how it performs. \n\n \n\nReferences\n-\tChung J, Kastner K, Dinh L, et al.

However, one advantage of our method is that we can use a lower training frequency for the VRMs (at least this works well in our experiments). Since the most time-consuming part is BPTT on RNNs, a lower training frequency for the VRMs can save much time. Indeed, training using our algorithm spends less time to that of SAC-LSTM, though we have more parameters. The following shows the scalability of our approach and alternative ones.\nFor the velocities-only RoboschoolHopper, our algorithm spends around 8 hours for 100k steps (including training the first-impression model) on a desktop computer using an intel i7-6850K CPU.  Our implementation of SLAC need about 5 hours and SAC-LSTM needs 12 hours on the same computer.  SAC-MLP needs only 1 hour since no RNN is trained, given that it mostly failed to learn PO tasks.\nThe total # of parameters is 2.8M for our algorithm (including 2 VRMs and RL controllers), 2.8M for SLAC, 0.4M for SAC, and 1.1 M for SAC-LSTM.\n\n\nReferences:\n-\tSutton R S, Barto A G.

Many of your points are quite valuable for improving the paper, we respond to them as follows. \n\n>>> The 3 categories to solve POMDPs appear artificial.\n\nTo solve POMDPs in which reward relates to history of observations, it is necessary to explicitly or implicitly take history of observations into account. We divide the corresponding methods into 3 categories because they have different implementations which lead to particular pros & cons. Also, we consider the introduction using 3 categories as a quick, short literature review for readers who are not familiar with related studies.\n\n\n>>> Figure 1 is too complicated for an illustrative figure and the presentation and clarity needs to be improved.\n\nThanks for this valuable suggestion! We have improved its clarity in the revised version (as you can download from the current webpage) by dividing this original Fig. 1 into two. The first one contains Fig.1 (a), and a simplified version of Fig.1(b). The second figure illustrates more detailed graphs as in Fig.1 (b)~(c).\n\n\n>>> However, some design decisions appear ad-hoc. For instance, the authors argue it is better to keep 2 models. \nNow, one could wonder if the proposed method would still perform better than the baselines if with, say, the just using a single VRM.\n\nOne of our major design principles is versatility (the algorithm is expected to work on different kinds of tasks without tuning hyper-parameters and model settings).  As we discussed in the last 2 paragraphs of Section 4.1, we worried about the instability of the representation before the VRM converges. This motivated us to conduct for empirical justifications (Appendix C) and we found that the performance using a single VRM in the long-term memorization task was unsatisfactory.\nNevertheless, we believe that a better design can exists than using 2 VRMs. We currently use this 2-VRMs design because its disadvantage is relatively less obvious (Since we only train the first-impression model before RL starts, the training time is not substantially more than that of using a single model).\n\n\n>>> Reference that should be included and possibly compared to [1] Watter, Manuel, et al\n\nThanks for the reference. We have cited this work in Section 2 in the revised version. This is an important early work which pioneered in investigating the idea of embedding the environment into latent variables for optimal control. However, one major difference from ours is that they used the model for planning while we do not. \nA fair comparison will be hard because (1) their method is not end-to-end, or more specifically, their hyper-parameters varied on environments. (2) they only modeled 1-step state-transition, making it difficult to capture long-term dependence. (3) their method requires the cost function (reward function) to be given.\n\n\n>>> What is the scalability, such as wall-clock time and #parameters of the approach compared to the baselines? (When using 2 VRMs the # of parameters is doubled)\n\nWe are sorry to miss this information in our paper, and we\u2019ve update the paper with the following details (Table 4 in the revised paper).\nFor the velocities-only Roboschool Hopper, our algorithm spends around 8 hours for 100k steps (including training the first-impression model) on a desktop computer using an intel i7-6850K CPU.  Our implementation of SLAC need about 5 hours and SAC-LSTM needs 12 hours on the same computer.  SAC-MLP needs only 1 hour since no RNN is trained, given that it mostly failed to learn PO tasks.\nThe total # of parameters (including 2 VRMs and RL controllers) is 2.8M for our algorithm, 2.8M for SLAC, 0.4M for SAC, and 1.1 M for SAC-LSTM.\nNote that although our algorithm uses more parameters, the wall-clock time was less than that of SAC-LSTM because we did not train the keep-learning VRM as frequent as training the RL controller. We could use a higher learning rate for a VRM since its learning is not bootstrapping, and train it every 5 steps (RL controller was trained every step). \n\n\n>>> Why the need to input the original observation x (and not just the latent representation) into the RL controller?\n\nThe reason is simple: we want our approach to learn efficiently also in fully observable environments, since it is not necessary (but maybe beneficial) to train the VRM(s). Therefore, we tried to input the raw observation x together with RNN states d to the RL controller, and we found that by doing so, our algorithm showed very good sample efficiency also in fully observable cases (such as Pendulum and CartPole in Fig.2).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dongqi.han@oist.jp", "doya@oist.jp", "jun.tani@oist.jp"], "title": "Variational Recurrent Models for Solving Partially Observable Control Tasks", "authors": ["Dongqi Han", "Kenji Doya", "Jun Tani"], "pdf": "/pdf/008bf8ee5b9f826cd28cccde848cfe092052030e.pdf", "TL;DR": "A deep RL algorithm for solving POMDPs by auto-encoding the underlying states using a variational recurrent model", "abstract": "In partially observable (PO) environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from unsatisfactory performance, since two problems need to be tackled together: how to extract information from the raw observations to solve the task, and how to improve the policy.

The paper is well written and technically sound. The method achieves improved performance in several (simpler) benchmark problems in comparison to strong baselines.\n\n* Detailed discussion\n\nThe work allocates latent variables to describe unobserved part of the state and learns the state transition probability model (the action-dependent generator (10)). Learning these state transitions becomes an unsupervised learning task, for which the lower bound on the likelihood of the observed data is optimized. This learning of the state transition model is actually similar to classical model-based RL. The policy and value functions are then learned on top of this model using SoTA techniques. From this perspective I would say this is a classical approach to partially observed reinforcement learning with advanced models for transition matrix and value and policy functions.\n\nThe work combines together variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) and soft actor critic (SAC) models into a rather advanced system for reinforcement learning. These parts are somewhat extended to fit together, but it is not clear whether all components are needed. For example, why z and d need to be distinguished, cannot they be combined into one latent variable \u201czd\u201d in order to simplify the number of connections? Or I am missing some important property necessary for the inference?\n\nIn (7),(8) are the expectations over the same state / actions or different? The notation is not clear about it.\n\nAfter (2), given x_t and d_{t-1} instead of d_t?\n\nThe experiments are conducted in the setting that the observations were all relevant measurements for the agent (positions, velocities). From Fig 7 RoboscoolHooper (close loop) we see that actually all measurements can be well predicted by generative model up to 8 steps ahead (in dim 2 that stays zero the noise is amplified). This is a nice and desirable property and is the consequence of the generative modeling and the marginal likelihood ELBO optimization. However the paper seem to argue (Appendix E) that the algorithm does not require the model to make accurate predictions and relies on the encoding capacity, which I find confusing. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see how this approach should scale to the setting when there are more sensory inputs, some less relevant than the other. In the end, is a good generative model to predict the future observation needed or not needed in this approach?\n\nThe exploration seems to be addressed just by randomizing the policy,  are there any better options?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper486/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["dongqi.han@oist.jp", "doya@oist.jp", "jun.tani@oist.jp"], "title": "Variational Recurrent Models for Solving Partially Observable Control Tasks", "authors": ["Dongqi Han", "Kenji Doya", "Jun Tani"], "pdf": "/pdf/008bf8ee5b9f826cd28cccde848cfe092052030e.pdf", "TL;DR": "A deep RL algorithm for solving POMDPs by auto-encoding the underlying states using a variational recurrent model", "abstract": "In partially observable (PO) environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from unsatisfactory performance, since two problems need to be tackled together: how to extract information from the raw observations to solve the task, and how to improve the policy.
