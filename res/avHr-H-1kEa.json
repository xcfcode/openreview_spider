The theoretical analysis shows that neural networks trained with smaller inverse temperatures (beta) exit the linear regime faster, which implies better performance. Experiments on image classification and sentiment analysis confirm that tuning temperature improves neural network generalization, even for state-of-the-art models.\n\nStrengths:\n* The topic is novel and interesting.\n* Empirical results confirm the importance of tuning temperature.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* Theoretical contribution seems unclear.\n* Experiments are limited to two tasks.\n\nI am leaning towards rejecting the paper. My biggest concern is about the theoretical contribution. The main conclusion of the theory seems to be that smaller beta is better, because it helps neural networks exit linear regime faster. But this doesn\u2019t explain the experiment results: optimal beta varies a lot across models, and it is sometimes quite large (beta >= 1). The paper empirically shows that small beta causes more instability as an explanation, but there is no theoretical explanation. Therefore, it is unclear how to use the current theory.\n\nIdeally, I hope the theory can be extended to explain why small beta causes instability (the conclusion section mentions this as future work), and/or how neural network architecture affects optimal beta, but these extensions do not seem obvious.\n\nThe experiments can also be expanded. Currently, there are only two tasks in the experiments. While the results are impressive, I would be more convinced if there are more tasks/models. For example, I wonder what the optimal beta is for state-of-the-art BERT-based models.  What about structured prediction tasks? Does the size of training set affects optimal beta?\n\nOn the positive side, I think the topic is novel and interesting, and the current empirical results are solid. If the theory can be extended to explain the tradeoff between small/large beta and the role of architecture, I would recommend this paper. Alternatively, the paper can also be improved by expanding experiments.\n\nOther suggestion and question:\n- Section 2 (theory) may be easier to read if there is a short summary of main claims/results.\n- For IMDb experiment, is there a reason for choosing GRU instead of more recent BERT-based models?\n- Some of the figure fonts are too small.\n\nFeedbacks after author response:\nI am maintaining my rating after reading the author response. It is a close decision. I like the topic, but I think the draft still has room for improvement to become a great paper. The updated draft is much clearer and answers some of my questions. Most importantly, the updated theory section explains why small beta can be bad: it slows training. While I appreciate the clarification, I think this argument still doesn't fully align with the experiment results. As the CIFAR-10 experiment points out, using small beta can still lead to good performance, so the main problem for small beta seems to be instability (rather than slow training), which the current theory couldn't explain. To improve the theory, I hope the paper can provide more insights into the instability caused by small beta. For example, I wonder if this is somehow connected to the slow training argument; perhaps the failed runs indeed suffer from slow training.

This gives an upper bound on the optimal learning rate of $\\eta^{*} \\leq c/\\beta$, for an architecture-dependent, $\\beta$-independent constant $c$.\n\nIf we compute $\\tau_{z}$, the time it takes the logits to change significantly, at the optimal learning rate, we get $\\tau_{z}\\approx ||\\textbf{Z}^{0}||/ \\beta$. What this means is that it takes  $O(1/\\beta)$ SGD steps for any significant learning to take place - so networks with smaller $\\beta$ will take more SGD steps to train.\n\nWe found this trend to hold in our empirical work; the best results for small $\\beta$ were achieved with $\\eta^{*} \\approx 0.01/\\beta$ (Figure 4), at the cost of slow training (in number of SGD steps) for small $\\beta$. We also observed empirically that training in this high learning rate regime made for less stable dynamics.

We believe your feedback will help us to improve our theoretical exposition. We apologize that our presentation gave you the impression that we did not have any \u201cnon-rudimentary\u201d theoretical results. We would note that although some of the scalings seem simple (for example, the scaling of $\\tau_{nl}$ with $\\beta$), there is significant nuance that must be understood about the units of the problem as we discuss in sec. 2.2. We believe that a careful exposition of these nuances is valuable to the community and puts \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d on firm footing.\n\nTo make things explicit, our main theoretical contributions are:\n\n* The inverse temperature $\\beta$ and logit scale $||\\textbf{Z}||$ control timescales which determine the rate of change of the loss, the relative change in logits, and the time for learning to leave the linear regime.\n* Generalization is generally insensitive to $||\\textbf{Z}||$, except for large values which lead to poorly conditioned learning.\n* Small $\\beta$ allows networks to use non-linear learning dynamics, which improve generalization.\n* The largest allowable learning rate is set by the non-linear timescale. Combined with the rate of change of the loss, this suggests that training networks with small $\\beta$ requires a tradeoff between slow and unstable learning.\n\nWe would like to clarify that our theory section was written informally intentionally to make the results easier to understand (for us, more formal exposition is not necessarily correlated with clarity). Thank you for your feedback, we are happy to make our exposition more formal and add explicit definitions of common notions such as `<<` and `~`. Thanks also for noting that we had not defined \u201cNTK\u201d, this is a great point though that is fortunately easy to correct. Indeed, all statements can be written out formally. For example, the definition of the logit change timescale $\\tau_{z}$, established in Equations 6 and 7, can be more formally established as follows:\n\n$$Z(x,t) - Z(x,0) =  \\textbf{v} t/\\tau_{z} + O(t^2/N**1/2)$$\n\nFor a vector $\\textbf{v}$ with $||\\textbf{v}|| = 1$ and $\\tau_{z}$ as defined in Equation 7 of the paper. Other timescales can be defined similarly.\n\nWould this style of prose help you to understand the text? If so, we are happy to make the corresponding changes to the manuscript.\n\nWe\u2019d also like to directly respond to this comment:\n\n\u201cI don't see a clear motivation for dropping batch normalization or tuning \u03b2 with batch normalization.\u201d\n\nNote that many architectures do not admit batch normalization, for example batch normalization does not improve training of RNNs or transformers. It is therefore interesting, noteworthy, and impactful that networks without batch normalization can attain similar performance to batch normalization with $\\beta$ tuning.\n\nAnother key point is that not all networks support batchnorm, or use batchnorm in a SOTA setting. Finally, our results on ImageNet show that combining batchnorm and $\\beta$ tuning can be beneficial, even if the optimal $\\beta$ is not far from $1$; the $\\beta$ tuning may be a cheap way to improve performance on a difficult task.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper986/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper986/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Temperature check: theory and practice for training models with softmax-cross-entropy losses", "authorids": ["~Atish_Agarwala1", "~Samuel_Stern_Schoenholz1", "~Jeffrey_Pennington1", "~Yann_Dauphin1"], "authors": ["Atish Agarwala", "Samuel Stern Schoenholz", "Jeffrey Pennington", "Yann Dauphin"], "keywords": ["theory", "learning dynamics", "temperature", "theory of deep learning", "generalization"], "abstract": "The softmax function combined with a cross-entropy loss is a principled approach to modeling probability distributions that has become ubiquitous in deep learning.

Combined with the rate of change of the loss, this suggests that training networks with small $\\beta$ requires a tradeoff between slow and unstable learning.\n\nIn particular, we apologize that the final point was not made more clear. In the text we presented the empirical results on optimal learning rate $\\eta^*(\\beta)$ and then provided a theoretical explanation; in fact, the theory inspired us to use a $1/\\beta$ scaling in the search for $\\eta^*$, which turned out to be nearly exact in practice.\n\nWe feel that the above results are significant; does our discussion clarify the impact of our ideas? We look forward to hearing from you, and are happy to further clarify any additional points.\n\nWe agree that the architecture dependence of the optimal $\\beta$ remains non-trivial, both empirically and theoretically. However, from a practical standpoint, the range of optimal $\\beta$ observed across all model classes is small enough ($10^{-2}-10^{1}$) that it should be easy in practice to tune $\\beta$ (see first response to reviewer 1 for an explicit tuning setup). The theory gives two actionable \u201crules of thumb\u201d:\n* For large $\\beta$, it is important to keep $||\\beta\\textbf{z}||$ small ($<10^{2}$) to avoid bad conditioning.\n* Training time and instability both increase rapidly for very small $\\beta$ (e.g. corresponding to $||\\beta\\textbf{z}||<<10^{-2}$).\n\nTogether, this suggests that tuning around the value of $\\beta$ which gives $||\\beta\\textbf{z}|| = 1$ is effective in practice. The optimal value $\\beta^*$ is hard to predict, but the theory suggests that there is not a large range which needs to be searched\n($10^{-2}-10^{1}$ in practice).\n\nWe chose GRUs on the IMDB task in order to evaluate models without pretraining, to more directly compare between a natural language task and an image classification one.

We believe you are correct about your understanding of $\\beta$, but to make things more explicit, setting large $\\beta$ has two main effects:\n* The network is _prevented_ from escaping the linearized regime (as seen by the increased ratio of $\\tau_{nl}/\\tau_{z}$).\n* If accompanied by an increase in $\\beta\\textbf{z}$, the scale of the logits, the learning dynamics are poorly conditioned.\nBoth of these effects can degrade generalization.\n\nWe appreciate the connection you have raised to results in Bayesian deep learning where $\\beta>1$ is generally a good training regime. This is a great question and we will include a discussion of the relationship between our setting and Bayesian deep learning in a revision. Thanks also for pointing out Wenzel, Florian et al. which seems to provide a very interesting perspective on temperature in the Bayesian setting. A difference between their setting and ours seems to be that Bayesian deep learning relies on generating samples from a stochastic process, where the final scale of the network outputs (divided by temperature) determine the sharpness of the distribution. By contrast, in SGD we are ultimately concerned with point-estimates based on the logits, so the temperature affects the learning dynamics, but not the sampling procedure. Note that in fig. 5c we observe the final logit scale to be similar across the $\\beta$-$||\\textbf{Z}^{0}||$ plane indicating that the final logit scale learned by SGD is consistent across initializations.\n\nThe optimal learning rate $\\eta^*$ is defined as the learning rate with the best generalization performance while training wide resnet on CIFAR10 over a sweep of \\beta, with $||\\textbf{Z}^{0}|| = 0$. We note that the optimal learning rate analysis combined with the generalization analysis gives us our practical prescription for tuning $\\beta$: at large $\\beta$ (such that $\\textbf{Z}^{0}||>>1$), generalization performance is generally poor. For very small $\\beta$ (in practice, for values $10^{-3}$ or lower), learning is slow and unstable.\n\nThe practitioner can tune a sweep over $\\beta$ within the limitations of their computational budget. Suppose the budget allows for 4 additional trainings after hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model can be trained over the range $\\beta\\in[10^{-2},10^{-1},10^{0},10^{1}]$, using the learning rate $\\eta_{0}/\\beta $ (where $\\eta_{0}$ is the optimal learning rate for $\\beta = 1$). If there is a significant improvement at the upper or lower ends of that range, then the practitioner can perform additional $\\beta$ tuning to improve the model. If there are no significant improvements, then $\\beta = 1$ is likely optimal/close to optimal.\n\nWe hope this clarifies the tuning procedure, and if it doesn\u2019t we\u2019d be happy to explain further."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper986/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper986/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Temperature check: theory and practice for training models with softmax-cross-entropy losses", "authorids": ["~Atish_Agarwala1", "~Samuel_Stern_Schoenholz1", "~Jeffrey_Pennington1", "~Yann_Dauphin1"], "authors": ["Atish Agarwala", "Samuel Stern Schoenholz", "Jeffrey Pennington", "Yann Dauphin"], "keywords": ["theory", "learning dynamics", "temperature", "theory of deep learning", "generalization"], "abstract": "The softmax function combined with a cross-entropy loss is a principled approach to modeling probability distributions that has become ubiquitous in deep learning.

In the theory part, this paper introduces the concepts of early learning timescale and nonlinear timescale, and shows how the learning dynamics depend on the parameter $\\beta$. The empirical investigations are carried out with wide Resnets on CIFAR10, Resnet50 on ImageNet, and GRUs on IMDB. The results suggest that the optimal $\\beta$ is architecture sensitive. \n\nThe theory developed in this paper is rudimentary. I don't see how the theory in Section 2 is crucial for the understanding of the impact of $\\beta$. The results basically say proper normalization on the timescale is needed for a fair comparison among different $\\beta$. There are neither formal statements nor proper discussions on the significance of the results. \n\nFrom the experiment results, the performance is relatively insensitive to the parameter $\\beta$ with batch normalization. I don't see a clear motivation for dropping batch normalization or tuning $\\beta$ with batch normalization. It is apparent that tuning for the best $\\beta$ is always no worse than setting $\\beta=1$.

Although I might overlooked, it should be explained explicitly.\n\n- Q) As far as I understood, from the ovservation of Sec 2.2 to 2.4, setting large $\\beta$ makes the times scales $\\tau_z$ and $\\tau_{nl}$ smaller, which means that  the early linear learning timescale and nonlinear timescale smaller. So, setting large $\\beta$ enhance escaping from the linear dynamics at the beggining, but the time period of the nonlinear dynamics become shorter, which results in the worse final performace. Is my understanding correct ?\n\n- Q) What is the definition of optimal $\\eta^*$ in Sec 3.1?\n\n- Following is just a comment. In Sec 3.3, the authors found that using small $\\beta\\in [10^{-2},1)$ might improve the final performance in a variety of networks.  On the other hand, when we consider Bayesian deep learning, using cold posterior that uses the temperatrue below $1$ results in better final perfomance compared to using $\\beta=1$ (For example see, Wenzel, Florian, et al. \"How good is the bayes posterior in deep neural networks really?.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.02405 (2020). ).
