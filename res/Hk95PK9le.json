However, because W * concat(x1, x2) can be rewritten as W1x1 + W2x2, we can avoid the quadratic number of multiplications by computing W1x1 and W2x2 separately and then summing them for each token-token pair. This requires n^2 additions but only 2n multiplications, rather than requiring n^2 concatenations and n^2 multiplications. In our discussion of memory complexity, we assume this is vectorized for even more efficiency--after computing W1x1 and W2x2 (which are both (n x d)-dimensional), we expand their first and second dimensions (making them (n x 1 x d)- and (1 x n x d)-dimensional) and do a broadcast sum, creating the (n x n x d)-dimensional vector.

With traditional classification, the vector of scores is defined according to an affine transformation over the input vector x (or r, the topmost recurrent state in our paper): Wx + b, where W is (c x d) and b is (c x 1). In this context, the bias vector b bears a clear relationship between the prior probability of each class P(class), and the linear transformation Wx is closely related to the likelihood of each class given the input, P(class | x). Biaffine attention straightforwardly extends this traditional approach to classification over a variable number of classes (here, words in the sentence). We need W to have the same number of rows as there are classes (that is, it still needs to have shape (c x d), even though we don't know a priori what c is), which we can do by representing each class with a vector z and defining W to be the product of ZU, where Z is (c x d) and U is (d x d). When we do the multiplication, ZU winds up being (c x d), which is what we need in order to make it analogous to fixed-class classification. Similarly, the bias vector b needs to be (c x 1), even when c varies from run to run--we can achieve this using the same matrix Z of class vectors, and multiplying it by a (d x 1) vector w. The resulting vector Zw is (c x 1), which is what we need the bias term to be. When we look at biaffine attention this way, we can see the clear relationship between Wx + b and (ZU)x + (Zw)--the two components (Zw) and (ZU)x both capture P(class) and P(class | x), respectively. In our case, the vector x is the vector representation of the token whose head we want to find, and the matrix of class vectors Z is the representation of each token in the sentence that it can attend to, the number of which changes based on how long the sentence is. The intuition behind the label classifier is similar; we want a scorer with components that clearly relate to P(label) (the prior probability of each label), P(label | head) (the probability of a head taking dependents of a certain type), P(label | dependent) (the probability of a dependent taking a certain class), P(label | head, dependent) (the probability of a label based on properties of both head and dependent taken together). Our label classifier x1Ux2 + W1x1 + W2x2 + b has this property--each term contributes something to the score that clearly correlates with an important part of the probability that we want to capture.\n\nThis shows how biaffine attention can be interpreted as variable-class classification and related to fixed-class classification. What's the relationship between traditional attention and fixed-class classification? With traditional attention, we concatenate the input vector x with a class-specific vector z and feed the result into an MLP (which is the same for all classes) with a single linear output. So, if we wanted to do traditional classification in the style of traditional attention, we would define the score of a class as U*relu(W1x + W2z + b), which simplifies to U*relu(Wx + z) since W2, z, and b don't depend on the input, where z is a class-specific vector but U and W are the same for all classes. While there's no reason this shouldn't work, it's clearly somewhat bizarre and considerably more complex than the alternative of just using Wx + b. It also lacks interpretability in the sense that you can't point to an individual component and tell what part of the probability it contributes to (e.g. there's no single component that clearly captures P(class)).\n\nSo in that sense, biaffine attention is intuitively a simple extension of fixed-class classification to variable-class classification, and comes with the same level of interpretability.
