Additionally to [1] it extends the process with using SO(2) bases which allow to learn combination of rotated FB bases and ultimately achieve good performance with less parameters than standard CNN networks thanks to filter truncation.\n\nIn general, this work is well written and shows interesting results. However it lacks context with regards to other existing works. For example [2] also uses steerable filters for achieving rotation equivariance, however with different steerable bases (rotation harmonics instead of FB). It would be useful to clarify why FB bases are more appropriate for truncation, eventually providing empirical evidence (even though rotation harmonics would probably need more parameters). Authors mention [2], however disregard it due to computational complexity, which would be the same if the rotation harmonics bases were truncated as well.\n\nSimilarly, this work is not strong in evaluating against existing methods. It provides evaluation of the vanilla group equivariant networks in a similar configuration, but due to design choices in the training and test set, it is not possible to compare it against other algorithms and other steerable bases such as those from [2]. This degrades the results slightly as it does not allow to verify the baseline results from other works.\n\nAdditionally, it would be useful to provide an ablation study which would show how important the bases in SO(2) are important for the model accuracy. This would allow to compare the results against the [1] as the FB filters are steerable as well (Equation 4).\n\nIt is hard to reach a final rating for this submission. On one hand, it can be seen as an incremental improvement of [1] for a new domain of tasks, without a thorough comparison against existing methods. On the other hand, the paper is well written and the results look promising - evaluation verifies that the algorithm performs well in multiple tasks with a fraction of parameters.\n\nConsidering that authors plan to release the source code and that this conference aims for publishing novel ideas (and the goal of this work is to achieve rotation equivariance with less parameters, which hasn't been tackled before), I am inclined towards acceptance of this paper, even though the experiments can be significantly improved.\n\nUnfortunately, I was not able to verify correctness of the provided proofs.\n\nAdditional minor issues:\n* The paper does not specify what FB bases exactly are being used (such as in [table 1;1]), mainly it does not seem to specify the SO(2) bases.\n* It would be useful to visualise K and K_\\alpha in Figure 1.\n* Citations, if not part of the sentence, should be in parentheses to improve readability (\\citep for natbib).\n* On page 8, end of first paragraph - wrong reference (see S.M.)\n* L, in section 2.3 is not defined.\n\n[1] Qiu, Qiang, et al. \"DCFNet: Deep Neural Network with Decomposed Convolutional Filters.\", ICML 2018\n[2] Weiler, Maurice, et al. \u201cLearning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs.\u201d CVPR 2018\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper40/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "RotDCF: Decomposition of Convolutional Filters for Rotation-Equivariant Deep Networks", "abstract": "Explicit encoding of group actions in deep features makes it possible for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle global deformations of images, which is critical to success in many vision tasks.

In fact, one of our main focuses is to design a principled and elegant way to improve steerable-filter CNN like SFCNN, by exploiting the joint filter decomposition over the product geometry of R^2 x S^1 simultaneously, adopting the product steerable bases FB bases x Fourier bases. This design is highly non-trivial, and it achieves multiple desirable properties at the same time, including rotation-equivariance, lower computational complexity, fewer parameters, robustness and provable representation stability. The theoretical result is also new and differs from that in DCF - as now we need stability not just against input deformation but \"module\" the group action - and the theory is supported by experiments which involve image rotations. As suggested, we have added an explanation of the technical challenges in the related work section.\n\nR2 also raises the question of \"How to determine truncation and set parameters in practice, and how it affects performance, computational complexity and number of parameters?\". At the moment, the choices of those hyper-parameters are mostly empirical, example values are given in Section 2.3 and in Table 3 & Table A.3. In the two tables, it is shown that the performance is not very sensitive to the choice of these parameters over a range, e.g., for rotMNIST, the accuracy maintained 98.40~98.60 for various choices of K and K_alpha down to 3 and 5. The parameter choice of K and K_alpha is interpreted as the \"frequency\" truncation (both in R^2 and in S^1), thus it trades-off between filter regularization and filter expressiveness. The choice of N_theta does not affect the number of parameters but affects storage. To better clarify all this, an explanation is added in Appendix A. The reduction factor from non-bases equivariant CNN to RotDCF is added in Section 2.3.\n\nWe have also corrected the suggested notation issues.

In addition, this leads to a compressed model and filter regularization. The authors give theoretical guarantees on the rotation equivariance and representation stability with respect to in and out of plane rotation. Empirical results show that the model attains better accuracy compared to CNNs and non-rotation-equivariant deep networks while using fewer parameters and also performs similarly to a rotation-equivariant model with much bigger capacity.\n\nPros:\n- Theoretical guarantees, elegant approach\n- Good empirical results compared to other models\n- Desirable properties: rotation-equivariance, lower computational complexity, fewer parameters, robustness and guaranteed stability to deformations\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat incremental technical novelty: combination of two previously published methods (Qiu et al. 2018 & Weiler et al. 2017)\n\nComments:\n1.

How do you determine the truncation in practice? How robust is the method to this choice? What are the trade-offs between using a value that is too low or too high? It would be interesting to show how performance and complexity vary with this parameter\n3. It would also be helpful to have a discussion on choosing the parameters K_{alpha} and N_{theta} and how this affects the performance, computational complexity and number of parameters. This would provide more intuition on the limits of this method and the types of data it can be used for\n4. In section 2.3, it would be helpful to specify an estimated range for the parameter reduction from the non-bases rotation-equivariant CNN to RotDCF (similar to the \u00bd factor from RotDCF to regular CNN) \n5.

Please see below for our response, and the manuscript is also updated.\n\nOne common question raised by both reviewers is \"to compare to the latest group-equivariant deep networks\". In the revised version, we update the experiment on rotMNIST in Table 3, Page 6, including a comparison to the result in SFCNN [2] as suggested by R1. The performance of RotDCF is comparable to the more computationally expensive group-equivariant networks, even with bases truncation which reduces the model complexity.\n\nTo answer the other questions of R1:\n\n- About Fourier Bessel (FB) bases: \"what bases are being used\" and \"compare to rotation harmonics\":\n\nThe FB bases used in the paper is the standard one (Abramowitz & Stegun 1964), and a formula is added in Sec. 2.2, new Eqn (4). It is the same FB bases used in [1], however, [1] considers usual CNN rather than rotation equivariant ones and does not exploit the steerable property of FB. Also note that the \u201cjoint steerable bases\u201d of psi (FB for space) and phi (Fourier for orientation) are used together here to decompose the \u201cjoint convolution\u201d Eqn. (1) (2) - the scheme is proved to be necessary for the group-equivariant property.\n\nCompare to rotation harmonics [2], FB bases are orthonormal and the truncation of FB base has a frequency interpretation - it preserves the low-frequency components and discards the high-frequency ends. This is crucial for the regularization effect (Figure 3 and Figure A.1) of using truncated FB bases. Theoretically, the properties of FB bases are also key elements upon which the representation stability can be proved.\n\n- \"An ablation study and compare with [1]\":\n\nThe rotMNIST experiment in Table 3 provides a comparison to DCF [1], which uses FB bases to decompose filters but is not designed to be rotation-equivariant: DCF gives similar performance to regular CNN, but inferior to RotDCF and [2]. This shows the importance of rotation-equivariant design in the network when handling input rotations.\n\nThe other minor points:\n* K and Kalpha are added in the plot of Figure 1.\n* Citations in parentheses now.\n* Page 8: \"S.M.\" refers to the Supplementary Material, defined on Page 3.\n*  A definition of L added in Section 2.3.

However, they are computationally expensive as the number of filters increases by a factor proportional to the number of groups. Inspired by ideas of filter decomposition used in CNN model compression, the authors of this work instead propose to use steerable filters across space and rotation, as basis filters for achieving rotation-equivariance, which leads to computational efficiency. \n\nThe authors show improved accuracy and model compression with their proposed approach versus regular CNNs for several different tasks (MNIST, CIFAR, autoencoders and face recognition) for rotated and upright images.\n\nFurthermore the authors theoretically prove and demonstrate empirically (via multiple experiments) the group equivariance property and the representational stability under input variations of their proposed architecture. \n\nThe work is novel and it solves an open research problem.\n\nHowever, the one major criticism of the work is that in the experimental section, especially for the rotated MNIST and rotated face recognition tasks, the authors should compare the accuracy of their method with the latest state-of-the-art group-equivariant deep networks instead of just regular CNNs. This will help to truly understand whether their method is superior or comparable to the more computationally expensive group-equivariant networks that are specifically designed to handle rotations in terms of accuracy as well or not. The regular CCNs, which are not designed to handle rotations, are obviously bound to be inferior to their approach.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper40/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RotDCF: Decomposition of Convolutional Filters for Rotation-Equivariant Deep Networks", "abstract": "Explicit encoding of group actions in deep features makes it possible for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle global deformations of images, which is critical to success in many vision tasks. This paper proposes to decompose the convolutional filters over joint steerable bases across the space and the group geometry simultaneously, namely a rotation-equivariant CNN with decomposed convolutional filters (RotDCF). This decomposition facilitates computing the joint convolution, which is proved to be necessary for the group equivariance. It significantly reduces the model size and computational complexity while preserving performance, and truncation of the bases expansion serves implicitly to regularize the filters.
