Our responses inline:\n\n> Since the Deep Q-learning is used to train the policy unit, I suspect the training time could be quite long. How does the reward curve look like while training? How stable is the training? Showing such details should make the paper stronger.\n\n- The training process is stable and takes only ~ 4 hours on a single Titan Xp GPU for the DQN policy (our main exp). We also tested policy gradient based policies, and the training process is not as stable and needs 2x time to reach similar restoration performances. These details will be included in our next revision, if space permits. However, the details of the employed policy unit are not our main focus (as you can also use handcrafted policies/statistics-based policies as mentioned in Section 2.2). Also, The reward curves look normal and uninformative, as in any other RL tasks.\n\n> It will be interesting to see more details on the model. For example, what is the mean/std for the number of folds that model applies for BSD68? What is the distribution (histogram?) of the folds for BSD68? Currently, the paper just simply shows the results and seems to hide many details. \n\n- This makes a very good point, we've already included part of these details (in Fig. 13). In addition, the variances of the number of unfoldings are quite low for seen noise levels, but larger for those not included in the training process. We\u2019ll improve the figures while introducing new figures to illustrate the behavior of the DURR in our next revision.\n\n> What was the choice for \\lambda in Eq. (3),(4)? How do you choose it?\n\n- In our experiements, we simply set \\lambda to 0. The regularization term may have potential benefit to the problem and need further studies, though. \n\n> How does the result look like on other benchmark datasets other than BSD68? It seems like the specific number of looks for each noise level is important for training. Do the choices of (25,4), (35,6), (45,9), (55,12) generalize well to other datasets as well?\n\n- Yes, these choices generalize to other datasets. We've tested our performance of the LIVE1 and Set12, and witnessed a similar gain compared to other methods (our own implementation). We only include results on the BSD68 dataset as it is a common practice for denoising papers. Our preliminary results on Set12:\n\n\\sigma=25\nBM3D   WNNM   DnCNN-B   DURR (ours)\n29.97     30.26      30.36           30.41\n\n\n- The choices are only based on empirical results.

Our responses inline:\n\n> The author seems to make strong assumptions on the nature of the noise and made no attempt to understand the nature of the learning beyond a limited set of qualitative example and PSNR. \n\n- Using gaussian distribution to simulate the noise statistics is a common setting in the image processing papers, due to the central limit theorem. However, we've shown our results for the case of natural image denoising, demonstrating our efficacy for more complicated noise modelings. Anyway, we will include more results on other noise types (e.g. poisson noise) in our next revision.\n\n> Even if the experimental protocol has been taken from prior work, it would have been appreciated to make it explicit in the paper, especially as ICLR is not a conference of image processing. Indeed, It would have made the paper more self-sufficient. \n> Second 2 describing the method is particularly hard to understand and would require more details. \n\n- Sorry for the writing issues. We will refine and include more details for these parts.\n\n> In the experimental section, the authors claim that \"These results indicate that the restoration unit has the potential to generalize on unseen degradation levels when trained with good policies\". It would have been important to mention that such generalization capability seems to occur for the given noise type used in the experiments. I didn't see any explicit attempt to variate the shape of the noise to evaluate the generalization capability of the model.\n\n- First, by saying \"generalize on unseen degradation levels\", we mean the generalization power on different degradation levels (e.g. different \\sigma for the gaussian noise) but not different noise statistics. Our extensive experiments have shown this kind of generalization for both tasks (gaussian denoise and JPEG deblocking).\n\n- Second, although we does not take the noise statistics into consideration initially when mentioning \"generalize\", the results on real image denoising clearly indicates our generalization power for unseen noise types: our model trained on gaussian noise also apply to real image noise (Fig. 7, and Section 4.4). And we will add more results on different noise types to further prove our generalization power, as is mentioned above.\n\nWe'd also like to defend that our main contribution is introducing the concept of optimal terminal time in the traditional nonlinear diffusion methods into the context of deep learning. Also, we've done analysis on using different restoration units (Appendix 4.1.2). Even using the plain fully convolutional neural network (ARCNN), the quantitive results are not decreasing. This phenomenon indicates that it is the designed dynamically unfolding strategy that brings the performance gain, using whatever kind of network as the restoration unit is not very important.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper419/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper419/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper419/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamically Unfolding Recurrent Restorer: A Moving Endpoint Control Method for Image Restoration", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new control framework called the moving endpoint control to restore images corrupted by different degradation levels in one model.

They utilized the moving endpoint control methodology, which essentially is applying reinforcement learning to the image restoration, and devised a method that adaptively decides the unfolding steps for given noisy image. The experimental results show encouraging results. \n\nPros:\nIn the experimental result, the proposed DURR outperforms DnCNN-B, a current state-of-the-art. Particularly, while DnCNN-B suffers for the noise level that it was not trained for, DURR can still denoise much better. (Table 2) A similar result is obtained for the JPEG deblocking problem as well. \n\nCons:\n- Since the Deep Q-learning is used to train the policy unit, I suspect the training time could be quite long. How does the reward curve look like while training? How stable is the training? Showing such details should make the paper stronger. \n- It will be interesting to see more details on the model. For example, what is the mean/std for the number of folds that model applies for BSD68? What is the distribution (histogram?) of the folds for BSD68? Currently, the paper just simply shows the results and seems to hide many details. \n- What was the choice for \\lambda in Eq. (3),(4)? How do you choose it?\n- How does the result look like on other benchmark datasets other than BSD68? It seems like the specific number of looks for each noise level is important for training. Do the choices of (25,4),(35,6),(45,9),(55,12) generalize well to other datasets as well?\n\nOverall, I think the paper should add more details mentioned above to make the paper stronger.
