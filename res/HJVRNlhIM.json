It is not obvious that this approach will be particularly useful or insightful for any applications different than the specific / esoteric one of interest to the authors.  They claim that a generic fully connected network without such special structure \u201cfailed to generalize .. always returning the mean of the training parameter grid\u201d.  To convince the reader that their attempt to use generic FC DNNs was fair, the \u201cvariety\u201d of network structures and optimization approaches they tried should be concisely reported. They said they suspected that the nets overfit, which begs the question of whether higher bias models (even simple linear models) might have provided better baselines to evaluate their proposed approach, than high capacity FC DNNS.  Also, Section 2 mentions examining a variety of hyper parameters, but doesn\u2019t make it clear whether both generic and Wilson loop based nets were given equal opportunities to exploit such hyper parameter search. In short, the authors seem to have found an effective solution to capture the invariances of their specific task, but have not provided very convincing evidence that their complex/unusual approach was necessary, nor whether this approach might generalize to other problems beyond their very specific one.  It is not clear what the ICLR audience should take away from such a paper.\n\nGiven this is only a workshop, a more lenient rating than for a conference paper is given.
