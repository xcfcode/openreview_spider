The idea is interesting, with some theoretical and empirical support.  However, reviewers feel that the contribution is somewhat limited, and certain parts (e.g., the DP view) can be further developed to strengthen the technical contribution.  Furthermore, one reviewer points out that the empirical results are not very strong, where the improvements on 3 Atari games are not very substantial.  Overall, while the paper is interesting and does have the potential, it seems too preliminary to be published in its current form.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The paper is partially motivated by the claim given at the beginning of section 3: \"Based on the observation that full policy evaluation accelerates convergence, ...\"  Can a reference be given?\n\n2.

AA has the updating rule $v^t = \\sum_i \\alpha_i B(v^{t-i})$, while A2VI puts the weighted sum into the fixed-point iteration $v^t = B( \\sum_i \\alpha_i v^{t-i} )$, as stated below the Algorithm 1. Therefore, we get two advantages:\n(1) a geometric interpretation of the proposed approach;\n(2) a better convergence analysis than AA on the problem of value iteration.\n\nTo see (2), note that Toth et al. [1] conducted the local convergence analysis for Anderson acceleration in nonlinear problems. They proved the Anderson iteration converges linearly with factor r. Applying their analysis to the problem of value iteration, the convergence rate r is larger than the discount $\\gamma$ for $k\\geq 2$ (worse than fixed-point iteration in the theoretical analysis). We get a better analysis with an exact convergence rate $\\gamma$ (better than the theoretical result in [1]).\n\n[1] Toth, Alex, and C. T. Kelley. Convergence analysis for Anderson acceleration.

Please see Section (6.4.4) in the reference paper [2] for the detailed definition, i.e., there exists a $K$, $0 < K < \\infty$, \\|P_{v^t} - P_{v^*} \\| \\leq K \\| v^t - v^* \\|,where $\\{v^t\\}$ is the sequence of values generated by policy iteration, and $P_{v^t}$ is the transition probability induced by the state value $v^t$.\n\n[2] Puterman, Martin L.

John Wiley \\& Sons, 2014.\n\n\nQ3: Rejection step seems very onerous, how often does it occur in practice?\n\nA3: It occurs on a small frequency in practice. The numerical experiments show that without the rejection step the proposed algorithm still has a quite faster convergence rate than the original VI. In some environments, the rejection step can bring further improvement to convergence.\n\n\nThe reviewer presented a very recent paper on arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03971) related to the proposed approach. We list some major differences listed here:\n(1) That paper studies the contraction function on real values, while we care about the state values on discrete state space. In the discrete setting, the $\\max$ operation make the state values not have the non-expansive property. Therefore, the convergence analysis of that paper could not be applied to our cases. \n    \n(2) That paper focuses on the convergence analysis on the type-I Anderson Acceleration, while our approach is more related to the type-II Anderson Acceleration. Moreover, our approach is not a straightforward application of AA to VI.

The general idea is to summarizes the history of previous iterates (value functions in this case) by finding of convex combination which also minimizes the residuals. The authors provide a solution for when an iterate is no longer representable by a convex combination of the recent history by simply bypassing the interpolation step and replacing it with a usual value iteration step. Using the intuition developed in the MDP case, they then adapt their DP algorithms to the learning case by substituting exact (tabular) value functions with deep function approximators. Experimental results are presented in 3 games from the ALE environment.\n\nThe jump from the DP formulation to the learning case is rather abrupt, and lacks sufficient motivation. The way the paper is currently structured is 50-50: 50% of the contribution is the DP view of the proposed method while the remaining half comes from the deep formulation (and experiments). I think that I would have preferred to see the entire paper being dedicated to the DP point of view, followed by a more principled Approximate DP analysis in the simpler linear case. Dedicating the remaining of the paper to the deep formulation almost feels like a missed opportunity to fully developing the theory initiated in the first section. But then of course the price to pay would be a paper which would be less aligned with the \"representation learning\" aspect of the conference. My main concern is that extending this technique to the deep setting mare involve some serious interference with other mechanisms already at play. It is very difficult to explain if the observed improvement come from the underlying DP basis or as a secondary effect of architectural and algorithmic considerations. \n\nTo my knowledge, this is the first attempt at using Anderson mixing in the MDP framework. However, I would appreciate if the authors could survey previous attempts (if any) by other authors, or more generally existing results in the literature on non-linear fixed-point methods.
