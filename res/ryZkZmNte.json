It essentially works by assigning a pseudo-label to each target example based on the labels of its neighbors in the source domain. Eq 2 can be rearranged to make this come out more clearly -- the label assigned to a target example x is 1/N\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i * k(x, x_i), where (x_i, y_i) are labeled examples in source domain, and k() is taken to be rbf kernel in the paper. A common classifier is then learned on both source examples and target examples (after this pseudo-labeling). \n\nThe paper doesn't provide an adequate overview of the prior work which makes it hard to judge the contribution and novelty. The proposed approach is also not convincing to me -- it assumes access to a universal representation which is good for both source and target. It combines both parametric (the classifier f is parametric) and nonparametric (1/N\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i * k(x, x_i)) methods to estimate 'f' which operates on the given representation. The method seems like a restricted version of some earlier works (e.g. Geodesic Flow Kernel for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, 2012) which also adapt the representation before building a nearest-neighbor based predictor. It also doesn't discuss density-ratio based methods for DA which are commonly used for instance based DA. The method is also not scalable since it involves computing the kernel on all pairs of source-target examples. Again, it doesn't provide any discussion on it. \n\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Adapting distance", "abstract": "domain adaptation", "pdf": "/pdf/3eaa66ed54dac2f52ddfa0a81d20d0bace159078.pdf", "paperhash": "lee|adapting_distance", "conflicts": ["no.conflicts"], "authors": ["woojin lee"], "authorids": ["wj926@snu.ac.kr"], "keywords": []}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "duedate": 1489183200000, "tmdate": 1489415209829, "id": "ICLR.cc/2017/workshop/-/paper64/official/review", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2017/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2017/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/workshop/paper64/reviewers"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2017/workshop/paper64/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2017/workshop/paper64/AnonReviewer2"], "reply": {"forum": "ryZkZmNte", "replyto": "ryZkZmNte", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/workshop/paper64/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2017/workshop/paper64/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "review": {"order": 2, "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"]}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "expdate": 1496959200000, "cdate": 1489415209829}}}], "count": 4}
