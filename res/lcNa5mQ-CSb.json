This property has been used in [1] to determine edge directions by extending the PC algorithm. In our case, after incorporating domain index $C$ in score-based search method such as GES, our method is guaranteed to find the causal direction due to the global and local consistency of the scores like BIC and GS score. The proof of this part is trivial because the score-based method is guaranteed to find the Markov equivalent class for augmented graphs including the domain index $C$. That is to say, it can distinguish between the V structure $C\u27f6V_k\u27f5V_l$, where $C$ and $V_l$ are independent conditioned on an empty set, and the structures $C\u27f6V_k\u27f6V_l$, $C\u27f5V_k\u27f6V_l$, $C\u27f5V_k\u27f5V_l$, where $C$ and $V_l$ are independent given $V_k$. Since $C$ is domain surrogate variable which, we have $C\u27f6V_k$, thus the algorithm will output either $C\u27f6V_k\u27f5V_l$ or $C\u27f6V_k\u27f6V_l$. Thus, the causal direction between $V_k$  and $V_l$ can be determined. \n\nIn the second case, we make use of the independence change property of a causal model [2,3,1]. That is, the parameters in the true causal model change independently while the parameters in a wrong causal model will change dependently. In this case, we use the dependence of parameters of each non-stationary causal module as a score, which is the last term in Eq (3) and (4).\n\n1. What does \u201c$\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ are independent\u201dmean? \n\t- We have dropped the notation of domain index $C$ here for simplicity. To be more precise, $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ should be written as $\u03b8_1(C)$ and $\u03b8_2(C)$ as in Figure 1(b). Here the domain index $C$ is a random variable. $\u03b8_1(C)$ and $\u03b8_2(C)$ are mappings of $C$, which can also be regarded as random variables. By saying \u201c$\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ are independent\u201d, we mean the causal module of $V_1$ and the causal module of $V_2$ change independently across domains. Suppose there are n domains, we will get a sample of size n for $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ and thus we can measure the dependence of $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$.\n\n2. What are $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ when $V_1$ and $V_2$ have multiple parents? That the relations among $V_i$ are linear does not mean the relation between $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ are linear.\n\t - When $V_1$ and $V_2$ have multiple parents, $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ are random vectors. For linear systems, the random vector is composed of all parameters in the regression equation.\n\t- Here by saying \u201clinear systems\u201d, we simply assume all the relations including those between $\u03b8_1$ and $\u03b8_2$ are linear. This is a quite ideal assumption but making the idea behind case 2 easy to follow. We also consider the non-linear system and learning objective is in Eq (4).\n\n3. Questions about $PA_C^k$\n\t- We apology that \u201cthe parameters of $V_C^k$ or $PA_C^k$\u201d is a confusing expression. It should be \u201cthe parameters of $V_C^k$\u2019s or $PA_C^k$\u2019s causal modules\u201d. We will modify it in the rebuttal version.\n\t- $PA_C^k$ is a set of variables. Precisely speaking, \u201cthe dependence between parameters of $V_C^k$\u2019s causal module and the parameters of $PA_C^k$\u2019s causal modules\u201d should be \"the sum of the dependence between parameters of $V_C^k$\u2019s causal module and the parameters of the causal module of each variable in $PA_C^k$\". The notation $PA_C^k\u2208V_C$ (which should be $PA_C^k\u2286V_C$) is confusing, we will modify it in the rebuttal version.\n\t- There is no need to consider the parents of $V_C^k$ that are not in $V_C$. Because this belongs to case 1 (i.e. $V_C^k$ is connected to $C$ but the parent is not).\n\n4. When $V_C^k$ has multiple parents $X$, $Y$, etc., it seems instead of considering $P(V_C^k | X,Y,...)$, only $P(V_C^k | X)$ is computed. Why should $P(V_C^k | X)$  be independent of $P(X)$  when $X$ may influence $V_C^k$?\n\t- No, we compute the causal module of $V_C^k$, which is conditional on all the parents of $V_C^k$.\n\n5. Confounders cancel the dependence\n\t- Here we assume the confounder is not strong, such that its effects do not change the final results. When the confounder is strong, it is possible that the dependence between parameters will be smaller in the reverse causal direction.\n\n[1] Huang, Biwei, Kun Zhang, Jiji Zhang, Joseph Ramsey, Ruben Sanchez-Romero, Clark Glymour, and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf. \"Causal discovery from heterogeneous/nonstationary data.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 21, no. 89 (2020): 1-53.\n\n[2] Pearl, Judea. \"Models, reasoning and inference.\" Cambridge, UK: CambridgeUniversityPress (2000).\n\n[3] Tian, Jin, and Judea Pearl. \"Causal discovery from changes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.2312 (2013)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades.

Identify more causal directions.\n\t- We use True Negative Rate (TNR, the higher the better), True Positive Rate (TPR, the higher, the better), and Structural Hamming Distance (SHD, i.e., the smallest number of edge additions, deletions, and reversals to convert the estimated graph into the true DAG, the lower the better) as criteria to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. As you can see in the experiments, our approach outperforms the others in most cases regards to these criteria, which we believe is a solid confirmation that the proposed algorithm is able to identify more causal directions.\n\n2. Questions regards to $\\theta$.\n\t- We use $\\theta_i(C)$ to represent the effective parameters in the causal module of $V_i $ that are assumed to be functions of $C$\uff0c which is a random variable representing domain index. In this case, $\\theta_i(C)$ also can be regarded as a random variable. That is why $\\theta_i(C)$ are represented as separate nodes in augmented graphs. Augmented graphs are defined over nodes $V\u222ag(C)\u222a\\theta(C)$. In practice, $g(C)\u222a\\theta(C)$ are not directly observed, so we take $C$ as a surrogate variable and represent augmented graphs as those over $V\u222aC$. Algorithm 1 is based on those simplified augmented graphs. In this respect, the augmented graphs are necessary.\n\n3. The dependence can be described with covariance.\n\t- Let's jump to part 2) $V_l \\in V_C $ in Section 2.3. Take the two variables (which are named as $V_1 $ and $V_2 $) case as an example. Assume the true causal graph is $V_1\u2192V_2 $. Causal discovery algorithms may output two possible directions: 1) $V_1\u2192V_2 $, we name the corresponding parameters as $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$; 2) $V_1\u2190V_2 $, we name the corresponding parameters as $\\theta_1'$ and $\\theta_2'$. Obviously, case 1) represents the true causal graph so $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are independent. While case 2) represents a wrong causal graph so $\\theta_1'$ and $\\theta_2'$ are dependent. As a result, we can use covariance as a criterion to select the true direction in linear systems (i.e., select the direction whose parameters $\\theta$ have smaller covariance).\n\n4. The terms in Equation 3 and 4.\n\t- If the criteria in Equation 3 and 4 contain the last terms (the results of the covariance and HSIC) only, there might be \"degeneration issue\". For more details, please refer to Degeneration issue part in Section 2.3. As for the other terms, the first one in Equation 3 and 4 can be regarded as likelihood, which is widely used in score-based causal discovery algorithms to identify edges and their directions. The second and third ones are regularization terms to avoid cycles (because we assume all the graphs are DAGs).\n\n5. Function $h(\u2219)$.\n\t- Please refer to Equation 5 in Appendix A.2.\n\n6. How the policy-gradient-based search integrates the MDS.\n\t- Original policy-gradient-based search [1] uses BIC as a score function to search the graphs. We replace BIC with MDS in MDSS (Algorithm 2). We will add more details about gradient-policy-based search in Section 2.4 in the rebuttal revision.\n\n6. CPDAGs, BNs and causal graphs.\n\t- In causal discovery and causal inference, it is common to represent causal relations using causal graphs. A causal graph is usually directed because we need to encode causal directions. When we assume the underlying causal graph is acyclic, we denote this type of graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) is an equivalent class of DAGs. CPDAG is usually used to represent the output of some single domain causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm. Bayesian Networks (BN) is a pair of DAG and a probability distribution, where the probability distribution satisfies the Markov condition for the DAG.\n\n7. Reinforcement learning and causal discovery.\n\t- In the first paragraph of Section 1, the description of the last sentence might be kind of misleading. To be more precise, [1] does not consider a reinforcement learning algorithm as a causal discovery algorithm directly. It takes the idea from reinforcement learning: policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning search for a best policy by receiving the stream of reward signals. (Score-based) causal discovery does a similar thing: a causal discovery algorithm searches for a causal graph that describes the observed data best by optimizing the pre-defined score function.\n\n[1] Zhu, Shengyu, Ignavier Ng, and Zhitang Chen. \"Causal discovery with reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.04477 (2019).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades.

The difficulty of causal discovery in multiple domains.\n\t- We have compared the performance of the proposed algorithm with those designed for single domain in our experiments. In Table 2, we evaluate the algorithms designed for single domain on both single-domain data and multiple-domain data (i.e. the values in column \"single\" and \"pool\"). The results show that algorithms designed for single domain have difficulty on multiple-domain data. Specifically, despite the minor increase in TPR, their TNR decrease dramatically when data from all domains are used. This phenomenon proves that applying algorithms designed for single-domain on multiple-domain data will introduce spurious edges. As a comparison, we evaluate the proposed MDSS on multiple-domain data. As one can see, MDSS fits the multiple-domain data much better.\n\n2. Writing improvement.\n\t- Thanks for the advice. Intuitively speaking, causal sufficiency means that all common causes (i.e., parents) of variables are measured. The explanation of causal modules is available in the second paragraph of Section 2.1. We will inspect our paper and add brief introductions to these terms in the rebuttal revision.\n\n3. How robust the algorithm is?\n\t- We allow that the mechanisms and parameters associated with the causal model change across data sets or over time, or even vanish or appear in some domains, while we assume that causal directions do not flip and variable set are fixed across domains. Considering the changing causal directions and number of variables is definitely interesting, and our method has paved the way for addressing these more challenging problems.\n\n4. How each component in the method contributes to the performance?\n\t- The proposed method contains two components: skeleton estimation (Algorithm 1) and MDS search (Algorithm 2). Since MDS search relays on the output of skeleton estimation, we only conduct ablation study to see how MDS search improves the performance. In other words, we keep the directions in step 3 of Algorithm 1 and output $G_1 $ (Algorithm 2 is not executed). We use the same experimental setting as Table 1. The results (TPR, TNR and SHD) are 0.58\u00b10.21, 0.92\u00b10.07 and 7.95\u00b14.51 for linear data, 0.32\u00b10.22, 0.58\u00b10.22 and  6.20\u00b10.26 for nonlinear data. Readers can compare the results with those of MDSS in Table 1. It is obvious that MDS search identifies more directions and boost the performance.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades.

That is the reason why we explicitly include $C$ into the causal system. Please see the detailed explanations below. \n\nWhen $C$ is the domain index, $P(C)$ follows a discrete uniform distribution whose possible values are $1,2,\u2026,n$. Correspondingly, the generating process of heterogeneous data can be considered as follows: First we generate random values from $P(C)$, and then we generate data points over $V$ according to the SEM in Equation 1. Finally, generated data points are sorted in ascending order according to the values of $C$ (i.e., data points having the same value of $C$ are regarded as belonging to the same domain). In other words, we observe the distribution $P(V\u2502C)$, where $P(V\u2502C)$ may change across different values of $C$, resulting in distribution-shifted data. Note that if we do not include $C$ into the system explicitly, samples of $V$ are not i.i.d. However, after explicitly including the domain index $C$ into the system, $P(V,C)$ is fixed, and thus the pooled data are i.i.d. samples from distribution $P(V,C)$.\n\nMoreover, you may consider it from another perspective: the task of classification, where we have data $X$ and class labels $C\u2208{1,2,3,\u2026}$. In classification, the labels are often regarded as samples from a discrete random variable. And the joint data $(X_1,C_1 ),(X_2,C_2 ),\u2026$ are regarded as i.i.d. samples from joint distribution $P(X,C)$.

All domains observe the same variables.\n\t- In this paper, we assume that all the domains observe the same variables and focus on addressing the distribution shift problem. There are some existing works on the non-identical variable sets problem, but they cannot handle the case when the causal edges change across domains [1][2]. In the presence of both distribution shift and non-identical variables, the problem will become even harder, because it is hard to estimate the distribution of those non-overlapping variables.

Errors in the skeleton may result in erroneous edges (i.e., missing edges, redundant edges, or edges with wrong directions) in the estimated causal graph, but will not lead to degeneration issue as long as we limit the search space of graphs over $V$ within that defined by the skeleton from Algorithm 1 to optimize MDS (i.e., Algorithm 2 is based on the fixed skeleton from Algorithm 1). \n\t\n[1] Triantafillou, Sofia, Ioannis Tsamardinos, and Ioannis Tollis. \"Learning causal structure from overlapping variable sets.\" In Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 860-867. 2010.\n[2] Huang, Biwei, Kun Zhang, Mingming Gong, and Clark Glymour. \"Causal Discovery from Multiple Data Sets with Non-Identical Variable Sets.\" In AAAI, pp. 10153-10161. 2020.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades.

The novel score is called Multiple-Domain Score, and can be incorporated into existing search strategies. It is shown that the MDS is guaranteed to find the correct graph skeleton asymptotically.\n\nStrengths: The paper is rather well written. The related work is properly addressed. The proposed criteria are interesting. \n\nWeaknesses: The results are quire incremental. The paper takes a lot from Huang et al., 2019. Assumptions 1 and 2 are somewhat obvious. The paper discusses criteria based on covariance and independence tests, however, their relation to the causal inference is not so straightforward. Algorithm 2 and Section 2.4 need more details.  \n\nQuestions: The authors tell that the proposed criterion can identify more causal directions compared to the state-of-the art. I did not really find any confirmation of this statement.\n\nSection 2.3: Why do we need $\\theta$? I see that it is also the formulation adopted by Huang et al., 2019, but why the 'augmented' graph is needed? Why $\\theta$ are separate nodes if they are (eq. 2 and 3) just parameters of distributions? \n\nSection 2.3: \"the dependence can be described with covariance\": I agree but what about causality? \n\nThe criteria eq. 3 and 4 contain several terms. I wonder, what is the performance (and whether it is very different) of the criteria containing the last terms (the results of the covariance and HSIC) only. What is the impact of other terms?\n\nProbably I missed it: what is h (what operation applied to the adjacency matrix)?\n\nHow the policy-gradient-based search integrates the MDS? (Section 2.4) \n\nIn experiments: is a CPDAG a causal graph? Is it always so? \nThe same for the Bayesian networks (the hill-climbing mentioned in section 2.4). Can we consider that a BN is a causal network? We need at least some assumptions. \n\nI also doubt that a reinforcement learning algorithm without necessary assumptions can be considered as a causal discovery method.\n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades.

For example, it looks to me that for Theorem 1 to be true, the pooled data $D_C$ must be i.i.d. samples from distribution P(V,C). However, $C$ is defined as the domain index. The problem setup simply assumes we are given $n$ data sets from $n$ domains. Then it\u2019s natural to assume the domain index \u201cC\u201d will stand for 1, 2,  \u2026, n. Under this setting, the pooled data are not i.i.d. samples, Theorem 1 will not hold, and I believe some other conclusions in the paper will not hold either. For Theorem 1 (and other conclusions) to hold, I believe one has to assume the domain index C is a random variable, such that the data sets from different domains are drawn randomly based on some P(C) and P(V|C). However, this may not be a realistic setting, and is not how the problem is set up in the paper. I don\u2019t think the real data sets in the experiments satisfy this setting (not clear how the synthetic data sets are generated).\n\nOverall, I think the paper has mistakes and vote for reject. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades.

The authors address this problem by augmenting the dataset with an indicator variable which indicates membership to  dataset. After augmenting the dataset standard algorithms for structure learning are applied, with the additional restriction that the indicator variable may only be an ancestor. The authors provide theory that shows the procedure consistently estimates the local structures. The authors then show how the additional information obtained from the structure learned with the context variable can be used to disambiguate directions. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach. \n\nOverall, I think this is a sensible idea and contains some nice results. I do have a couple of questions: \n\n(1) In the paper the authors explicitly limit the algorithm to the case where all domains observe the same variables, however it seems like this need not be the case?\n(2) The authors should cite the literature on learning with mixtures of Bayesian networks. While the aims are different, the model representation is very similar. \n(3) Can the authors provide intuition on whether this degeneracy will also become an issue if there are errors in the skeleton detection algorithm?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper999/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Score-based Causal Discovery from Heterogeneous Data", "authorids": ["~Chenwei_Ding1", "~Biwei_Huang1", "~Mingming_Gong1", "~Kun_Zhang1", "~Tongliang_Liu1", "~Dacheng_Tao1"], "authors": ["Chenwei Ding", "Biwei Huang", "Mingming Gong", "Kun Zhang", "Tongliang Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "keywords": ["causal discovery", "heterogeneous data", "structure learning"], "abstract": "Causal discovery has witnessed significant progress over the past decades. Most algorithms in causal discovery consider a single domain with a fixed distribution. However, it is commonplace to encounter heterogeneous data (data from different domains with distribution shifts). Applying existing methods on such heterogeneous data may lead to spurious edges or incorrect directions in the learned graph. In this paper, we develop a novel score-based approach for causal discovery from heterogeneous data. Specifically, we propose a Multiple-Domain Score Search (MDSS) algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the correct graph skeleton asymptotically. Furthermore, benefiting from distribution shifts, MDSS enables the detection of more causal directions than previous algorithms designed for single domain data. The proposed MDSS can be readily incorporated into off-the-shelf search strategies, such as the greedy search and the policy-gradient-based search.
