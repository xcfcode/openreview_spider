Withholding a part of the quantities that the true posterior depends on from the inference network leads to a biased generative model and an approximate posterior that underestimates uncertainty. We examine the effect of the conditioning gap on model-based reinforcement learning with variational world models. We study the effect in three settings with known dynamics, which enables us to compare to a near-optimal policy. Our finding is that the impact of the conditioning gap becomes severe in systems where the state is hard to estimate.", "pdf": "/pdf/731f3f98d1263a0ac8e2f7f35218737a15eb3a3f.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|less_suboptimal_learning_and_control_in_variational_pomdps", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021less,\ntitle={Less Suboptimal Learning and Control in Variational {\\{}POMDP{\\}}s},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to Self-Supervision for Reinforcement Learning Workshop - ICLR 2021},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=oe4q7ZiXwkL},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615310247528, "tmdate": 1615313016556, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/SSL-RL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
