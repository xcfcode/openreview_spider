As the authors mention, there has been some (although seemingly not much) previous work on using multi-agent games to teach communication, and it certainly seems like a direction worth pursuing. Moreover, the approach of switching between these games and some supervised learning, as in the experiment described in Section 5 and suggested in Section 6, seems particularly fruitful. \n\nNote: For \u201cclarity\u201d, I believe some of the network connections in Fig 1 have been omitted. However, given the rather highly-customized architecture and the slightly hard-to-follow description in Section 3, the shorthand diagram only adds to the confusion. The diagram probably needs to be fine-tuned, but at the very least (especially if I am misunderstanding it!), a caption must [still] be added to help the reader interpret the figure. \n\nOverall, the framework (Section 2) is great and seems quite effective/useful in various ways, the results are reasonable, and I expect there will be some interesting future variations on this work as well.\n\nCaveat: While I am quite confident I understood the paper (as per confidence score below), I do not feel I am sufficiently familiar with the most closely related literature to accurately assess the place of this work within that context.

Also, note that, although using pre-learned object names is a good strategy in our initial experiments, it is already challenged by the ReferIt experiment (where most images contain objects that were not seen in the supervised training phase), and it would not generalize to other setups we would like to test next (such as the interesting case you suggest where both images contain the same object)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language", "abstract": "The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to expose them to large amounts of text.

As more and more applications of reinforcement learning are being explored, this approach brings us back to a basic question. Is the problem solving approach of machines similar to that of humans.\n\n- The task is simple enough to make the post learning analysis intuitive.\n\n- It was interesting to see how informed agents made use of multiple symbols to transmit the message, where as agnostic agents relied only on 2 symbols. \n\nCons\n- The task effectively boils down to image classification, if the 2 images sent are from different categories. The symbols used are effectively the image class which the second agent learns to assign to either of the images. By all means, this approach boils down to a transfer learning problem which could probably be trained much faster than a reinforcement learning algorithm.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language", "abstract": "The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to expose them to large amounts of text.

Both agents observe two images. The first agent, called the sender, receive a binary target variable (t) and must send a symbol (message) to the second agent, called the receiver, such that this agent can recover the target. The agents both get a reward, if the receiver agent can predict the target. The paper proposes to parametrize the agents as neural networks - with pretrained representations of the images as feature vectors - and train them using REINFORCE. In this setting, it is shown that the agents converge to  optimal policies and that their learned communications (e.g. the symbolic code transmitted from the sender to the receiver) have some meaningful concepts. In addition to this, the paper presents experiments on a variant of the game grounded on different image classes. In this setting, the agents appear to learn even more meaningful concepts. Finally, multi-game setup is proposed, where the sender agent is alternating between playing the game before and playing a supervised learning task (classifying images). Not surprisingly, when anchored to the supervised learning task, the symbolic communications have even more meaningful concepts.\n\nLearning shared representations for communication in a multi-agent setup is an interesting research direction to explore. This is a much harder task compared to standard supervised learning or single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, which justifies starting with a relatively simple task. To the best of my knowledge, the approach of first learning communication between two agents and then grounding this communication in human language is novel. As the authors remark, this may be an alternative paradigm to standard sequence-to-sequence models which tend to focus on statistical properties of language rather than their functional aspects. I believe the contributions of the proposed task and framework, and the analysis and visualization of what the communicated tokens represent is a useful stepping stone for future work. For this reason, I think the paper should be accepted.\n\n\n\nOther comments:\n- How is the target (t) incorporated into the sender networks? Please clarify this.\n- Table 1 and Table 2 use percentage (%) values differently. In the first, percentages seem to be written in the interval [0, 100], and in the second in the interval [0, 1]. Please correct this. Perhaps related to this, in Table 1, the column \"obs-chance purity\" seems to have extremely small values. I assume this was mistake?\n- \"assest\" -> \"assess\"\n- \"usufal\" -> \"usual\"", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language", "abstract": "The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to expose them to large amounts of text.
