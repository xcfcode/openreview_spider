This is done  by replacing the deterministic units with stochastic ones.\n\nThe paper has several issues with respect to the method and related work. \n\n- The paper needs to mention [Graves 2011], which is one of the first works to inject noise into the dynamics of an RNN. It is also important to know how these two approaches differ. E.g.: Under what conditions are the two approaches equivalent? How do they compare experimentally?\n- While [Bayer & Osendorfer, 2014] and [Chung et al, 2015] appear in the list of references, these works are not discussed in the main text. I personally think these are extremely related, pioneering the use of stochastic units in a recurrent context. In the end, the original paper can be cast in these frameworks approximately by removing the KL term of the ELBO. This might be ok by itself, but that the authors are apparently aware of the work (as it is in the list of references) and not discussing them in the main text makes me highly skeptical.\n- The method is introduced for general exponential families, but a) not empirically evaluated for more than the Gaussian case and b) not a complete algorithm for e.g. the Bernoulli case. More specifically, the reader is left alone with the problem of estimating the gradients in the Bernoulli case, which is an active area of research by itself.\n- The paper makes use of the reparameterisation trick, but does not cite the relevant literature, e.g. [Kingma 2013, Rezende 2014, and another one I currently struggle to find].\n- The desiderate for noise seem completely arbitrary to me and are not justified. I don\u2019t see why violation of any of them would lead to an inferior regularisation method.\n\n### References\n[Graves 2011] Graves, Alex. \"Practical variational inference for neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2011.\n[Kingma 2013] Kingma, Diederik P., and Max Welling. \"Auto-encoding variational bayes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6114 (2013).\n[Rezende 2014] Rezende, Danilo Jimenez, Shakir Mohamed, and Daan Wierstra. \"Stochastic backpropagation and approximate inference in deep generative models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1401.4082 (2014).\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Noise-Based Regularizers for Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful models for sequential data.

Interesting idea that is insufficiently explored.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "review": "The RNN transition function is: h_t+1 = f(h_t,x_t)\nThis paper proposes using a stochastic transition function instead of a deterministic one.\ni.e h_{t+1} \\sim expfam(mean = f(h_t,x_t), gamma) where expfam denotes a distribution from the exponential family.\n\nThe experimental results consider text modeling (evaluating on perplexity) on Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. The method of regularization is compared to a reimplementation of Variational Dropout and no regularization.\n\nThe work is written clearly and easy to follow.\n\nOverall, the core idea in this work is interesting but underexplored. \n\n* As of when I read this paper, all results on this work used 200 hidden units realizing results that were well off from the state of the art results on Penn Tree Bank (as pointed out by the external reader).\nThe authors responded by stating that this was done to achieve a relative comparison.  A more interesting comparison, in addition to the ones presented, would be to see how well each method performs while not controlling for hidden layer size. Then, it might be that restricting the number of hidden dimensions is required for the RNN without any regularization but for both Variational Dropout and Noisin, one obtains better results with a larger the hidden dimension.\n\n* The current experimental setup makes it difficult to assess when the proposed regularization is useful. Table 2 suggests the answer is sometimes and Table 3 suggests its marginally useful when the RNN size is restricted.\n\n* How does the proposed method's peformance compare to Zoneout https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01305.pdf?\n\n* Clarifying the role of variational inference: I could be missing something but I don't see a good reason why the prior (even if learned) should be close to the true posterior under the model. I fear the bound in Section (3) [please include equation numbers in the paper] could be quite loose.\n\n* What is the rationale for not comparing to the model proposed in [Chung et. al] where there is a stochastic and deterministic component to the transition function? In what situations do we expect the fully stochastic transition here to work better than a model that has both? Presumably, some aspect of the latent variable + RNN model could be expressed by having a small variance for a subset of the dimensions and large one for the others\nbut since gamma is the same across all dimensions of the model, I'm not sure this feature can be incorporated into the current approach. Such a comparison would also empirically verify what happens when learning with the prior versus doing inference with an approximate posterior helps.\n\n* The regularization is motivated from the point of view of sampling the hidden states to be from the exponential family, but all the experiments provided seem to use a Gaussian distribution.

This paper proposes a method for reducing overfitting in RNNs. This consists in injecting noise judiciously into the hidden units of the RNN. We perform training by integrating over the injected noise. This has an ensembling effect to it just like dropout. Our purpose was to compare to the non-regularized RNN and to variational dropout as implemented in Gal et al. 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287). \n\nIn table 2 we used 200 hidden units so it is expected that we don't match the state-of-the-art numbers which correspond to way bigger networks. Again, the purpose was to compare performance of the three types of networks: deterministic, regularized with dropout, regularized with noisin. The benefits we are seeing with our method will be even better with bigger networks where regularization is beneficial. We are adding those results in the revision."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Noise-Based Regularizers for Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful models for sequential data.
