In the binary case every neuron can be described exactly by a rule so any error from an extracted rule is the result of not finding the optimal solution. Usually the failure of an extraction algorithm to find an accurate solution is the result of not allowing rules of sufficient complexity. Our proposed method is meant to show the degree to which failures of an extraction method are due to restricting complexity.\n\nWith regards to the weight-ordering, for a binary network it can be shown that, when evaluated over the whole input space, the best M-of-N rule is the one which includes the N literals with highest weight magnitude. The same is true for a continuous network on an input space of the form [a,b]^n if the neurons are binarized using the same value to split them.\n\nSince testing over the whole input space is infeasible we evaluate the rules on a subset of the training data which leaves open the possibility that a different ordering could result in more accurate rules on that subset but we feel that because of the reasons mentioned above the weight-ordering produces the most accurate M-of-N rules.\n\nOf course the search space of M-of-N rules themselves is only a subspace of all possible rules. We've included additional experiments on the simple but well known DNA-promoter dataset and find that complex M-of-N rules can accurately approximate the network suggesting that M-of-N is a reasonable restriction of the search space and that the results are a good representation of the accuracy/complexity relationship for extracted rules.\n\nWith regards to the second point, in principle you can replace the whole network with a hierarchy of extracted rules as long as you choose consistent splits to binarize the neurons in each layer. As you point out though this will cause errors to accumulate. Our goal was to produce a baseline accuracy/complexity relationship, practical rule extraction algorithms might not achieve these results but the method allows us to gain insight into feasibility of rule extraction as a method of explanation.\n\nThe results for robustness were tentative and have been removed in order to make room for a more complete discussion of the method. Further experiments on knowledge extraction and robustness will be done in the future."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper285/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper285/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper285/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing the Accuracy/Complexity Landscape of Explanations of Deep Networks through Knowledge Extraction", "abstract": "Knowledge extraction techniques are used to convert neural networks into symbolic descriptions with the objective of producing more comprehensible learning models.

An measure of rule complexity (which takes into the account the number of terms in the rule) is proposed, and an approximate rule induction algorithm which binarizes the neurons using an information gain criterion is provided.\n\nThe paper gives no evaluation of the accuracy of extracted rules on a test set. Instead, the fidelity to network is evaluated on the train set for individual neurons (see below).\n\nSince even for moderately-sized networks the method would result in lots of rules, the authors propose instead to use the proposed algorithm and complexity criterion as a tool for understanding the complexity of concepts detected by a layer. The results, gathered in Figure 1, suggest that for some layers complex rules do approximate the behavior of neurons, while for other layers a neuron can't be replaced with a single but complex M-of-N rule.\n\nThe ideas presented in this paper seem rudimentary and require further exploration before being publishable. First of all, the main result of complexity-vs-layer doesn't differentiate between failures of the approximate rule induction algorithm (the terms in rules are considered for inclusion in a single order, reducing the search space) and the genuine complexity of the rules - this can be verified by evaluating a more exhaustive algorithm on at leas a few neurons (not necessarily on all of them).\n\nSecond, if the rules are extracted in a layerwise fashion,  their errors accumulate for deeper layers. However, Algorithm 1 suggests that each neuron is replaced by a rule independently from others, and moreover that it requires the true value of the neurons in the layer below, not of their rule counterparts. This means that the rules can't be combined and explains why the paper doesn't provide any measure for aggregate rule accuracy.\n\nSimilarly, the robustness of rules to adversarial examples is meaningless - it seems that applying the rules results in a system which is less accurate (only 8/10 of rules mimick their neurons with no rule complexity penalty) overall, but also makes fewer adversarial examples.\n\nMinor remarks.\nPlease don't ever produce Figures such as Figure 1: no legend (description in text), color selection is not black and white friendly, font is so small that the axis labels are hard to read...

While the idea itself is interesting, I think that the paper is still in a very early stage and needs more work before it can be accepted. Detailed comments below.\n\nPros: \n1. The paper proposes a new algorithm to interpret CNNs.\n2. The paper is reasonably well written.\n\nCons: \n1. The experimental evaluation is quite weak. The authors present their (partial) results on a single dataset and also seem to generalize some of the findings in a rather misleading way. \n2. The proposed method is not compared against any baseline though there are ample rule-based methods to understand NNs in literature.\n2. It seems like the literals in the generated rules are actually outputs of previous stages of NNs. Are the rules even human understandable in that case? \n\nDetailed Comments:\n1. I think that the paper is missing a very clear discussion on what is novel about the proposed method in contrast with recent work on explaining NNs (or black box models) using rule based approaches. Examples of relevant papers include \"Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations\" by Ribeiro et. al. and \"Interpretable & Explorable Approximations of Black Box Models\" by Lakkaraju et. al. among others. \n2. Another important piece of discussion that is missing is how the proposed search technique for extracting M-of-N rules is novel compared to a lot of prior literature which deals with the same problem\n3. I would strongly encourage the authors to experiment with at least three different datasets and multiple CNN architectures. \n4. I would really like to see the output of the proposed approach. What kinds of rules are being generated at each stage? It seems like the literals in the generated rules are actually outputs of previous stages of NNs. Are the rules even human understandable in that case? \n5. It would be good to do a simple user study to demonstrate that human users are able to understand something useful from the generated explanations.

the authors should use a more careful terminology\n- from the paper, it seems that the authors tried a single randomly chosen set 1000 random inputs in 4.1; they should most definitely try several such sets\n- Figure 1 should have a legend in the image, rather than as a 2-line caption\n ", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper285/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing the Accuracy/Complexity Landscape of Explanations of Deep Networks through Knowledge Extraction", "abstract": "Knowledge extraction techniques are used to convert neural networks into symbolic descriptions with the objective of producing more comprehensible learning models. The central challenge is to find an explanation which is more comprehensible than the original model while still representing that model faithfully. The distributed nature of deep networks has led many to believe that the hidden features of a neural network cannot be explained by logical descriptions simple enough to be understood by humans, and that decompositional knowledge extraction should be abandoned in favour of other methods. In this paper we examine this question systematically by proposing a knowledge extraction method using \\textit{M-of-N} rules which allows us to map the complexity/accuracy landscape of rules describing hidden features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments reported in this paper show that the shape of this landscape reveals an optimal trade off between comprehensibility and accuracy, showing that each latent variable has an optimal \\textit{M-of-N} rule to describe its behaviour. We find that the rules with optimal tradeoff in the first and final layer have a high degree of explainability whereas the rules with the optimal tradeoff in the second and third layer are less explainable.
