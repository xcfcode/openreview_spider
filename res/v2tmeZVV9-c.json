Despite what the title and abstract suggests, the scope of the paper is limited to a single physical system, and there is no evidence that this approach will work on generic physical systems. The title and abstract should be tuned down and made more specific.\n\nThe key idea is novel: instead of replacing the entire time integrator with a neural network, which is typical of previous approaches, the authors propose to use the network to accelerate the constraint project step, and in particular to still rely on the standard projection used in PDB, but using the network to generate the initial guess for the nonlinear optimization. A better initial guess will reduce the number of iterations (an ideal one will cause termination after 1 iteration), thus reducing runtime. Errors in the prediction will still likely be corrected by the non-linear optimization making the approach stable. \n\nWhile I think the idea is great on paper, I am concerned by the results and choices made in the paper, in particular:\n1. The abstract makes claims of generality, while the approach is very specific to rod simulation with a very specific solver.\n2. The approach is based on Daul et al. 2018, it is likely that the authors started from their codebase. However the key contribution of that paper is \u201cHowever, this solver requires many iterations to converge for complex models and if convergence is not reached, the material becomes too soft. In contrast we use Newton iterations in combination with our direct solver to solve the non-linear equations which significantly improves convergence by solving all constraints of an acyclic structure (tree), simultaneously. Our solver only requires a few Newton iterations to achieve high stiffness and inextensibility\u201d. My understanding is that the authors of this submission are purposely comparing against the CG solver instead of the new faster solver proposed in Daul et al. 2018. Is this correct and if so why? The comparison should be done with the state of the art, which is not CG.\n3. I am having a hard time understanding the plot in figure 4. Is this the entire runtime or just the inference time for the projection part? It seems that the speedup is ~20%  which is minor and I believe switching to newton as suggested in Daul et al would likely give you way more. Please report complete runtimes of the entire simulation, and also a plot of the errors. A speedup of 20% only on a specific step of the algorithm is in my opinion not worth training a neural network and thus losing generality. Especially since this is applied to an algorithm that is not the current state of the art.\n4. How is CG initialized? Do you use the previous solution?\n5. Please add a comparison of your network against a simple nearest neighbor search over the training data, as a simple baseline.\n6. Report complete timings of how long it takes to train. How many simulations do you need to run before the training time is amortized by the gained acceleration?\n7. Only the simpler examples from Daul et al 2018 are shown in the paper, the rope knots and the teaser model have been omitted. Why? These are the more challenging cases where errors and penetrations would be immediately visible.\n\nWhile I agree with the author's conclusions that \u201cWe discovered that applying GNs for replacing the initial guess has fundamental advantages over end-to-end approaches.\u201d this is by itself not a surprising result. Endtoend approaches are, currently, usually worse than traditional time integrators for integrating physical systems. Instead of replacing the entire system, replacing a smaller piece does less damage than replacing the entire integrator, but it is still likely worse if the comparison is properly done with the state of the art. I don\u2019t think these results are publishable until a clear advantage over the state of the art is shown, or an argument that is not superior performance is made against standard PBD simulators.\n\nA minor comment: \u201cis included corresponding to a parameterization by arc length\u201d I do not understand this sentence.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe paper has considerably improved:\n\nthe title is now accurately describing the paper\ncomplex scenes have been added (and the method works there too)\ncomparison with knn has been added and it shows a clear improvement for the proposed method\n\nI think the paper has improved, but I still find the comparison with direct solvers problematic. For small scenes like the one shown in this paper, a direct solver is fine, there is no need to use an iterative one. If the scenes are large enough to require an iterative solver (i.e. a direct one runs out of memory) then it should be shown that the proposed methods provide benefits in that specific setting. It could be that my bar for comparison is too high, as I usually publish in a different community where quantitative improvement against the closest baseline is always required.\n\nOverall, I am still mildly positive, but not willing to champion this paper given the many issues raised in the reviews.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accurately Solving Rod Dynamics with Graph Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Shao3", "kugelstadt@cs.rwth-aachen.de", "torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa", "wp06@amu.edu.pl", "~Jan_Bender1", "~Soren_Pirk2", "~Dominik_Michels1"], "authors": ["Han Shao", "Tassilo Kugelstadt", "Torsten H\u00e4drich", "Wojciech Pa\u0142ubicki", "Jan Bender", "Soren Pirk", "Dominik Michels"], "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "Iterative solvers are widely used to accurately simulate physical systems.

Meanwhile nearly all of the text and figures (up to numbering) are the same. Hence, I didn't update my review or go hunting around for small changes. If the important changes addressing the NeurIPS rejection were largely in the appendix (e.g., Figs 10 & 11) then I did not read them initially.\u201d\n\nA: We respect the statement of being misled by a very unfortunate comparison of personally annotated sections between the previous manuscript and the current one. We would appreciate it if a careful review of our paper can now take place.\n\n\n\u201cThis model is perhaps geometrically complex but the motion is simple. Since the branches all move in synchrony there are not many interesting collisions to resolve. To test collision complexity consider a fork pulling out of a bowl of spaghetti. In graphics, these are the kind of tests I'd like to see in 2020.The result in this paper looks very similar to what modal bases can do (e.g., Barbic and James 2007). Under what setting should we consider this state of the art? Certainly not for \"CG simulation\" in general. Is this statement taken within real-time simulation and specifically including only methods with a similar learning based methodology? \u201d\n\nA: Please note that the tree dynamics are coupled in real-time with the fluid dynamics of the wind field. This coupling is highly complex and an active topic of research in the CG community [Gissler et al. 2019]. It has been recognized that wind flows in tree crowns exhibit turbulent motion (Role of buoyant flame dynamics in wildfire spread, Finney et al. 2015), which is expected to result in irregular branch swaying. Our method for fluid coupling is based on [Pirk et al 2017] and is capable of simulating turbulence. Please find examples of the complexity of swaying motion in the accompanying video (https://vimeo.com/233082391). Therefore, the statement that all branches sway in synchrony is questionable. Furthermore, it seems to us that this phenomenon is at least as compelling in terms of pushing boundaries in science as computing the rod dynamics required to simulate pulling spaghetti out of a bowl. In summary, we disagree with the assumption that the swaying tree is similar to the complexity of what is shown in [Barbic and James 2007] (which deals with deformable bodies not with fluid-solid coupling) and instead think that it is on par with phenomena investigated by the CG community in 2020. Please also note that our novel experiments indicate that  ML-based methods do not seem able to accurately solve physical systems to the quality of what SOTA methods in CG can do. In this context our method is a clear advancement over SOTA.\n\n\n\u201cI agree with Rev4 that there should be a comparison to Deul et al. 2018. The rebuttal argues that the point is about improving iterative solvers. That's fair, but there's a question of generalization and practical speed. If Deul et al. is faster and more general in practice (compare their much more complex trees for example), then the applicability and impact of the proposed method is diminished.\u201d\n\nA: Please note that the swaying tree examples in [Deul et al 2018] are not computed in real-time. Instead the discussed solver requires ~10 seconds for the pine, ~8 seconds for the willow and ~6 seconds for the birch tree. We designed our method with real-time simulations in mind. Therefore, this comparison not only seems unnecessary (please see our response to R4) but also non-trivial to perform. \n\n\n\"Old Figure 5 is now Figure 4 (unchanged) My comment remains the same.\" \n\"Old Figure 4 is now Figure 11 (unchanged) My comment remains the same.\"\n\nA: We have addressed these comments in our previous rebuttal to NeurIPS. Please respond to these statements if you want to continue this discussion instead of relying on copy-pasted text. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accurately Solving Rod Dynamics with Graph Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Shao3", "kugelstadt@cs.rwth-aachen.de", "torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa", "wp06@amu.edu.pl", "~Jan_Bender1", "~Soren_Pirk2", "~Dominik_Michels1"], "authors": ["Han Shao", "Tassilo Kugelstadt", "Torsten H\u00e4drich", "Wojciech Pa\u0142ubicki", "Jan Bender", "Soren Pirk", "Dominik Michels"], "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "Iterative solvers are widely used to accurately simulate physical systems.

Lacks stronger evidence for systems with more nodes and longer time horizons.\u00a0", "review": "Summary: the authors present a Graph Network (GN) architecture to speed up the running\u00a0time of rod physical simulations by predicting the initial guesses to reduce the number of iterations of\u00a0an iterative position-based solver. The proposed\u00a0approach offers speed-ups varying from 6-50%, depending on the problem analyzed.\u00a0\n\nStrengths:\u00a0\nThe paper is well written and motivated, methods are very clear. There are substantial experiments to test for the paper's main claims on inference efficiency and out of distribution generalization, although mostly\u00a0on small scale systems (up to 200 nodes) and short time horizons (100 steps).\n\nWeaknesses:\u00a0\n\n1) The biggest weakness to me is shown on Figure 6, when plotting the CG interaction\u00a0ratio as a function of time,\u00a0for the straight\u00a0bending rod and the elastic helix, up to 1000 timesteps. Especially on the straight bending rod simulation (orange curve), the speed-up is not consistent across time. Further insight on why those oscillations are happening would be appreciated. In the\u00a0elastic helix simulation (green), one also sees a huge drop right after the training regime range (50-100 steps). End-to-end approaches will generally offer more significant speed-ups (orders of magnitudes rather than the 6-50% provided by COPINGNet), but they might struggle to remain stable for longer time horizons. Therefore what one would like to see from an alternative approach like the proposed here, is a system that scales well with time. Figure 6 shows that's not the case here yet.\u00a0\n\n2) It would have been interesting to see how the GN compares to a different neural network predicting the initial guesses (say a simple LSTM or -- more ambitiously\u00a0-- a transformer). I understand that many of the successful neural approaches for physics simulations are GN based, so the choice is well motivated -- but those systems are generally trained end-to-end, which isn't the case in the work from this paper. Therefore, it's not clear to me that other non GN approaches wouldn't perform well on this task of producing better initial guesses for an external solver.\n\n3) In figure 4, even if small, you can see a decay on the speed-ups as you have a greater number of nodes (towards the right tail of the curve). Since the main interest in an approach that purely offers speed-ups (rather than from example, additional better generalization or accuracy) would be on large scale simulations, I see this as a fundamental weakness.\n\n4) When comparing to end-to-end approaches, authors cite a few times in the text instability for longer time sequence rollouts. Note that in Sanchez et al. 2020, the authors propose adding noise to the inputs and correcting the predictions as a stabilizing\u00a0technique, they present stable rollouts for systems with thousands of steps (longer than the ones considered proposed here). This could be integrated in the end-to-end approach tested on the paper.\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all, despite its weaknesses, I still think the paper takes a meaningful step towards the efficient use of neural networks for physical simulations. So I am willing to adjust my score after some of my concerns have been addressed.\u00a0\n\nSmall typos:\nIn the \"Generalization\" paragraph from the Evaluation section, should it be Figures 9 and 10, rather than 7 and 10?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accurately Solving Rod Dynamics with Graph Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Shao3", "kugelstadt@cs.rwth-aachen.de", "torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa", "wp06@amu.edu.pl", "~Jan_Bender1", "~Soren_Pirk2", "~Dominik_Michels1"], "authors": ["Han Shao", "Tassilo Kugelstadt", "Torsten H\u00e4drich", "Wojciech Pa\u0142ubicki", "Jan Bender", "Soren Pirk", "Dominik Michels"], "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "Iterative solvers are widely used to accurately simulate physical systems.

Meanwhile nearly all of the text and figures (up to numbering) are the same. Hence, I didn't update my review or go hunting around for small changes.

Please find our response to your statements and questions below:\n\nTo 1): In Figures 4 and 6 we have shown that our method can extrapolate beyond the training data range. Whereas, in Figures 9 and 10 we show that end-to-end approaches fail to generalize beyond the training data range. These results provide evidence that our method performs better than existing end-to-end strategies in general scenarios. We agree that we have not conclusively shown that our method improves all iterative solvers. However, we think that our method has the potential to stimulate further research towards more generalizable GNs for physical systems. While it would strengthen our claims toward generalization to apply our method to other solvers (e.g. FEM) or other physical systems, we think that this is outside the scope of a single paper. Therefore, after carefully considering your feedback toward our claims of generalization in the abstract (and title) we decided to tone-down these claims. \n\nTo 2): We introduce a novel approach for learning physical systems based on an iterative solver and not a direct solver like the one introduced in [Deul et al. 2018]. We focused on iterative solvers because they offer advantages (e.g. parallel computing, better suited to complex scenarios, more general) compared to direct solvers. For an iterative solver, we have shown that our method outperforms previous GN-based methods in terms of accuracy and generalizability in a specific physical scenario. We did not aim at advancing the state-of-the-art of simulating rod dynamics but instead we wanted to prove that iterative solvers can be optimized with GNs without sacrificing accuracy. Therefore, we think comparing to direct solvers is not necessary. \n\nTo 3): The reported speedup in Figure 6 is NOT of a single step of the numerical time integration, but instead a total speedup of the simulation for the respective physical system. For the helix case we report a persistent total speedup of around 50%, whereas for the rod case it is initially over 50% and later stabilizes beyond the training data range at over 20%. \n\nTo 4): Yes, we use the previous solution corresponding to an initialization of the Delta with zero (see \u201ccanonical initialization with zeros\u201d in Section 3).\n\nTo 5): We added a baseline against a knn now shown in the updated Figures 6 (left, right). This new result further highlights the technical contribution of our GN architecture. \n\nTo 6): We trained our network for 5 hours for the bending rod scenario and 6 hours for the helix case. \n\nTo 7): We have added the rope knot example to the supplementary material as further evidence that our method can handle complex physical systems (with penetrations).

Please find answers to your statements and questions below:\n\nTo Weakness 1: \n\nWhile we agree that the improvement appears marginal compared to end-to-end approaches, our analysis has shown that end-to-end methods lack required accuracy. In contrast, our method provides solutions to physical systems with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, just comparing end-to-end methods and our approach only based on the total speedup is not meaningful. \n\nTo Weakness 2: \n\nIt seems this is a misunderstanding. Generally, it is acknowledged that end-to-end approaches necessitate retraining for individual shapes. In contrast, in our method we have observed a carry-over across different 3D tree shapes (variations of geometry and topology).  We can provide the failure case for the end-to-end approach as additional result for the final version of the paper if requested. While the carry-over for our method could be enhanced, it is still more generalizable compared to previous work. Please see Section 4 \u201cGeneralization\u201d, \u201cComplex Scenarios\u201d, and \u201cCollision\u201d (and, e.g., Figure 5) for support of this claim. If anything, we think in terms of generalizability this is an advancement of the current state-of-the-art rather than a weakness.\n\nTo Question 1:  \n\nYes, we are convinced that future work will show similar improvements to a whole variety of numerical solvers, e.g., finite element solvers or linear complementary problems. However, in this paper we focused on the evaluation using position-based dynamics. We toned-down claims of generalizability in title and abstract.\n\nTo Question 2: \n\nThe different speedup rates can be explained by the quality of the predictions provided by the GN. This quality of the initial guesses decreases for shapes which are out of the training distribution. Therefore, in cases where the system diverges from the training distribution, more iterations are required to converge. An oscillating helix is a more constrained scenario compared to the dynamics of swinging rods. To further demonstrate general applicability and speedup ratios, Figure 9 (Supplemental Material) shows a new experiment of a tightening knot as an additional example.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accurately Solving Rod Dynamics with Graph Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Shao3", "kugelstadt@cs.rwth-aachen.de", "torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa", "wp06@amu.edu.pl", "~Jan_Bender1", "~Soren_Pirk2", "~Dominik_Michels1"], "authors": ["Han Shao", "Tassilo Kugelstadt", "Torsten H\u00e4drich", "Wojciech Pa\u0142ubicki", "Jan Bender", "Soren Pirk", "Dominik Michels"], "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "Iterative solvers are widely used to accurately simulate physical systems.

We have conducted experiments on complex systems of over 1000 colliding nodes and not -- as stated in the review -- on only 200 nodes. Please see Figure 5 (botanical tree) and Section 4 (complex scenario) for more details.\n\nTo 1): Figure 6 was showing a single arbitrary simulation run using our GN method. We have replaced Figure 6 with two new Graphs (Figure 6 left, right). Figure 6 (left) now shows the average of 20 runs of the same simulation for the bending rod, while Figure 6 (right) shows the average of the elastic helix case. As indicated by the aggregation of these simulation runs oscillations are not periodic. Furthermore, we ran additional experiments where we constrained the dynamical systems in various ways (e.g. removing degrees of freedom for the rod motion), which did not eradicate oscillations. Therefore, after further investigating our experiments we think that the oscillations are caused by context switches of the (single) GPU running the PBD simulation and the GN inference simultaneously. This means that the oscillations do not characterize the performance of our method.\n\nOur goal was to propose a novel method for adapting GNs for physical systems without sacrificing accuracy. Therefore our method is an orthogonal approach to end-to-end methods. Our results indicate that our method significantly outperforms vanilla physical solvers persistently beyond the training data range. This is a strong contribution that should be exposed to the community as it is expected that similar results can be obtained for other physical solvers and physical systems.\n\nTo 2) and 4): We have included a comparison to knn as a baseline in the rod and helix case in Figure 6 and in the supplementary material (Figures 10 and 11). This new result further demonstrates the technical contribution of our GN architecture. For the final version we can provide additional baselines based on an LSTM and/or another GNs using the regularization techniques mentioned in [Sanchez et al. 2020].\n\nTo 3): We disagree with the notion that increasing the number of nodes with decreasing overall speedup is a fundamental flaw of our method. We have shown in Section 4 (Complex Scenarios), that even in the case of over 1000 colliding nodes noticeable speedups can still be obtained. The goal of our method is to provide a speedup to direct solvers (also for complex scenarios) without losing accuracy -- any amount of speedup while maintaining accuracy is an advancement.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accurately Solving Rod Dynamics with Graph Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Shao3", "kugelstadt@cs.rwth-aachen.de", "torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa", "wp06@amu.edu.pl", "~Jan_Bender1", "~Soren_Pirk2", "~Dominik_Michels1"], "authors": ["Han Shao", "Tassilo Kugelstadt", "Torsten H\u00e4drich", "Wojciech Pa\u0142ubicki", "Jan Bender", "Soren Pirk", "Dominik Michels"], "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "Iterative solvers are widely used to accurately simulate physical systems.

This review appears to be a direct copy of the response to the previous version of our paper. Therefore, the large majority of arguments brought up in this review cannot be considered meaningful feedback any longer. Given the character limit, we cannot exhaustively answer all statements brought up in this review. The examples below demonstrate the disparity between the provided statements in the review and the actual sections and figures in the document.\n\n\u201cFor example, the paper mentions many times that it is not replacing the time integration/constraint projection with an end-to-end trained network for robustness reasons. Let's see it fail then!\u201d\nWe added Figure 10 and 11 in the supplementary material to exactly address this point. Figure 10 illustrates the temporal evolution of our method with the end-to-end approach which fails to correctly solve with an increasing number of time steps. Figure 11 provides quantitative assessment of the extent of the error accumulation.\n\n\u201cThis modest speedup coupled with the small number of simple experimental scenarios worries me that these results will not generalize to a statistically significant speed up in general.\u201d\nTo address this statement, we have included a complex dynamical system of a botanical tree model swaying in a wind field. This example is based on over 1000 colliding nodes simulated at interactive rates, which can be considered a state-of-the-art CG simulation. The review again appears to not consider this additional result.\n\n\u201cThe graph network description (which gets at the core contribution of this paper) is poorly described. I read this section many times and via cross referencing with [13] could finally understand with low confidence what is being done.\u201d\nThis is a direct copy of the previous review. We have significantly reworked the text based on the previous comments and also received positive feedback on the clarity of the text (please see other reviews).\n\n\u201cI do not understand Figure 5. What is the purple curve? the vanilla CG solver? Then wouldn't its speed up be 1x?\u201d \nFigure 5 shows our newly added experiment on simulating botanical tree models as complex systems and not as claimed a purple curve. This statement appears erratic.\n\n\u201cFigure 4 is very confusing. Is this figure showing that none of the hyper parameters matter except for MLP width? This is surprising to the point of indicating a bug/overfitting.\u201d\nFigure 4 does not mention hyper parameters. Therefore, we cannot meaningfully respond to this statement. \n\nFinally, we think that it is potentially rude to accept reviewing a paper and not reading it.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper409/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accurately Solving Rod Dynamics with Graph Learning", "authorids": ["~Han_Shao3", "kugelstadt@cs.rwth-aachen.de", "torsten.hadrich@kaust.edu.sa", "wp06@amu.edu.pl", "~Jan_Bender1", "~Soren_Pirk2", "~Dominik_Michels1"], "authors": ["Han Shao", "Tassilo Kugelstadt", "Torsten H\u00e4drich", "Wojciech Pa\u0142ubicki", "Jan Bender", "Soren Pirk", "Dominik Michels"], "keywords": ["Dynamical Systems", "Representation Learning"], "abstract": "Iterative solvers are widely used to accurately simulate physical systems.

To simulate a physical system, PBD first computes updated locations of vertices then corrects the estimates of the initial position by constraint projection.  The projection step is computationally expensive, and that is where the proposed COPINGNet is applied to generate a good initial guess for the built-in linear system solver (e.g., CG).\n\nStrengths:  \n1. The proposed method is superior to end-to-end approaches in terms of long-term stability and out-of-distribution transfer (initial conditions, discretizations, material parameters, etc.).\n2. This paper applies the idea of message passing to design the graph network architecture, which enables propagations of node information (location, speed, etc.) and edge information (Young's module, torsion module, etc.) on the graph.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1.  According to Figure 4 and Figure 6,  the total speedup of the entire simulations is approximately 1.4 compared to vanilla CG solver.  This improvement seems marginal.\n2. It seems that the current model cannot generalize to different shapes. If a network needs to be retrained for each different shape, it may significantly limit its applicability in practice.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Can the initialization guess network accelerate other iterative solvers? \n2. According to Figure 6, helix simulation and bending rod simulation show different speedup rates (when extrapolating in time). Can this be explained? \n\nGenerally speaking, this article provides a new idea. By combining graph neural networks with traditional methods, the speed of solving physical systems is improved.

My review remains largely the same.\nIt is also doubtful that these changes have satisfyingly address the other three\nreviews.\n\nThis paper proposes an iterative PBD solver which uses a neural network to guess\nthe constraint force and position updates before polishing with a conjugate\ngradient solver. The method utilizes a graph network architecture which makes it\nagnostic to the particular discretization allowing generalization (in theory)\nacross scenarios.\n\nSpeeding up simulations is an evergreen topic. A strength of this work is the\nproblem that it is tackling. The choice of methodology makes it mildly of\ninterest to the ICLR community. It is an application (without adaptation) of\ngraph networks. The result is mildly positive (though not earth shattering),\nindicating success of graph networks to some degree. I have not seen graph\nnetworks applied to rod simulation or elasticity simulation, although they have\nbeen applied to meshes in geometry processing (similar and more challenging\nscenario) and neural networks have been applied more generally to speeding up\nelasticity simulations (with what would be a trivial extension to rods). A\npossibly unique strength of this paper is the combination of rod simulation and\na convergent solver (i.e., just using the network as an initial guess in an\niterative solve). However, this is a really straight forward idea and the gains\nare again small. So, while this is a strength it is minor and possibly not\nexciting to the broader ML/ICLR community.\n\nMy main criticism of this method have to do with three aspects of scaling: 1)\nthe network is applied at the inner most loop and message passing occurs by\niterating over edges (which I believe are based on the original connections).\nThis means that global information passing requires M = O(n) iterations. 2) the\nmethod operates only on the fine scale details (the input resolution). This runs\ncounter to multigrid literature which would suggest operating on all the\nresidual at all frequency levels. 3) the method shows a small number of small\nexamples (low resolution rods with one or two rods in a scene). PBD is often\nemployed in scenarios with millions of rod segments from thousands of rods\n(e.g., hair on a human head will have 100,000 rods each with hundreds/thousands\nof segments). For a 1.5x to become impressive I would like to see this operating\nat scale.\n\nI worry that the network has simply memorized a mapping from global positions to\nguesses. Since the network has access to the raw positions, I would be surprised\nif it has learned rotation and translation invariance. Lack of this would be a\ngood indication that it's learning a spatial mapping. This would be a severe\nlimitation.\n\nThe exposition of main results is very confusing. If I understand this part of\nFigure 5 (and I doubt I do), then the pink curve below the red and black curves\nis indicating that using this method does not simply speed up the CG solve but\nsome how negatively affects the total runtime (I guess by confusing the outer\nloop down an incorrect path). So the gains by taking an aggressive initial guess\nare tempered a bit, though still resulting in a (quite modest) overall speed up\n<1.5x.\n\nThis modest speedup coupled with the small number of simple experimental\nscenarios worries me that these results will not generalize to a statistically\nsignificant speed up in general. \n\nCollisions appear as an afterthought. If the speedups were more significant, I\nwould happily excuse this as collisions can often be an extra systems effort.\nHowever, part of the \"glory\" of a PBD solver rather than an FEM+LCP type\nsimulation is that one can throw all sorts of constraints into the same system.\nSo, when this paper tacks on collisions outside the learning aspect of this work\nit calls the choice of PBD into question as perhaps needlessly inaccurate or an\n\"purely-out-of-convenience\" type choice rather than a scientifically motivated\none.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the paper always compares to a baseline of resetting\nthe position and multiplier updates to zero. Is this the best baseline? What\nabout using the previous iteration? Or other momentum based strategies? \n\nThe for-loop on line 8 of the pseudocode is misleading/confusing/incorrect. This\nimplies that updates for rods are conducted independently. But then line 9\nappears to accept as input and send as output coordinates and lagrange\nmultipliers for the entire system (rather than the rod i). What is the role of\nthe for loop of line 8 if line 9 does not depend on which rod is being\nconsidered? it would be better to write out the linear solve that is being\nconducted (e.g., with CG). The figure and text below confuses me further. Is the\ncorrection guess applied: a) once per time step, b) once per constraint\nlineariztaion (just before CG), or c) once per rod?\n\nThe revised paper (and perhaps rebuttal) should include a clarified pseudocode\nto understand what this method is actually proposing.\n\nThe effectiveness of the network depends on a parameter M which would appear to\nscale poorly with the resolution of the input shapes. Does M need to be adjusted\nfor higher resolution examples?\n\n\nWhat is the video showing? Training data created using the groundtruth\nsimulation? Results of this method at test time? If so what was the training\ndata used for each? This video did not really help supplement this submission. I\nwish that the video had included experiments that could be used to gain\nintuition about what's being learned and about the accuracy of the initial\nguess.\n\nFor example, the paper mentions many times that it is *not* replacing the time\nintegration/constraint projection with an end-to-end trained network for\nrobustness reasons. Let's see it fail then!\n\nIn a future revision I would like to understand\n  - under what circumstances does end-to-end learning fail, but this method\n    succeeds.\n  - under what circumstances does simply using the previous frame's constraints\n    as an initial guess out perform this method?\n  \nIt'd be great to see a video where we also see an evolving plot per-frame (like\nFigure 6) showing the performance gains of applying this method rather than\nnaive initialization methods. This would be great to get match up whether the\ngains happen far from the rest state, in collision heavy scenarios, or the\nopposite etc.\n\nOn line 180, I did not understand how the set of input edges to the graph\nnetwork is defined. If inputs nodes are assigned to each rod segment, then input\nedges should connect two segments. Are only neighboring segments connected with\nthese edges? (e.g., the dual graph of the polyline representing the central axis\nof the rod). Or are all possible pairs of segments generated? Where are Young's\nand Torsion moduli stored? It's natural to store Young's modulus at segments but\nthis would correspond to nodes of the graph not edges.  \n\nThe graph network description (which gets at the core contribution of this\npaper) is poorly described. I read this section many times and via cross\nreferencing with [13] could finally understand with low confidence what is being\ndone.\n\nFigure 4 is very confusing. Is this figure showing that none of the hyper\nparameters matter except for MLP width? This is surprising to the point of\nindicating a bug/overfitting.\n\nI do not understand Figure 5. What is the purple curve? the vanilla CG solver?\nThen wouldn't its speed up be 1x? Are these plots showing two different y-axis\nor two different examples (straight vs helix)? The caption is very confusing.\n\nThe paper does not accurately categorize past works when it writes \"Existing\nmethods enable learning these systems often in an end-to-end manner and with a\nfocus on replacing the entire integration procedure.\" Many fluids papers retain\npressure projection to ensure divergence free-ness and within elasticity\nsimulation, \n\nLatent-space Dynamics for Reduced Deformable Simulation\nLawson Fulton, Vismay Modi, David Duvenaud, David I.W. Levin, Alec Jacobson\n\ndoes not replace the time integration procedure.\n\nIn the future, I would appreciate a pdf in supplemental material with\nhighlighted changes.
