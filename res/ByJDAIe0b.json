What this means is that the agent has a reservoir of n \"states\" in which states encountered in the past can be stored. There are then of course two main questions to address (i) which states should be stored and how (ii) how to make use of the episodic memory when deciding what action to take. \n\nFor the latter question, the authors propose using a \"query network\" that based on the current state, pulls out one state from the memory according to certain probability distribution. This network has many tunable parameters, but the main point is that the policy then can condition on this state drawn from the memory. Intuitively, one can see why this may be advantageous as one gets some information from the past. (As an aside, the authors of course acknowledge that recurrent neural networks have been used for this purpose with varying degrees of success.)\n\nThe first question, had a quite an interesting and cute answer. There is a (non-negative) importance weight associated with each state and a collection of states has weight that is simply the product of the weights. The authors claim (with some degree of mathematical backing) that sampling a memory of n states where the distribution over the subsets of past states of size n is proportional to the product of the weights is desired. And they give a cute online algorithm for this purpose. However, the weights themselves are given by a network and so weights may change (even for states that have been observed in the past). There is no easy way to fix this and for the purpose of sampling the paper simply treats the weights as immutable. \n\nThere is also a toy example created to show that this approach works well compared to the RNN based approaches.\n\nPositives:\n\n- An interesting new idea that has potential to be useful in RL\n- An elegant algorithm to solve at least part of the problem properly (the rest of course relies on standard SGD methods to train the various networks)\n\nNegatives:\n- The math is fudged around quite a bit with approximations that are not always justified\n- While overall the writing is clear, in some places I feel it could be improved.

The weight assigning (write) network is optimized for maximize the expected rewards. This article focuses on the calculation of gradient for write network, and provides some mathematical clues for that.\n\nThis article compares their proposed architecture with RNN (GRU with 10 hidden unit) in few toy tasks. They demonstrate that proposed model could work better and rational of write network could be observed. However, it seems that hyper-parameters for RNN haven\u2019t been tuned enough. It is because the toy task author demonstrates is actually quite similar to copy tasks, that previous state should be remembered. To my knowledge, copy task could be solved easily for super long sequence through RNN model. Therefore, empirically, it is really hard to justify whether this proposed method could work better. Also, intuitively, this episodic memory method should work better on long-term dependencies task, while this article only shows the task with 10 timesteps. \n\nAccording to that, the experiments they demonstrated in this article are not well designed so that the conclusion they made in this article is not robust enough.

We have explained our methodology in more detail in the general comment above.\n\nRe:\nIt is because the toy task author demonstrates is actually quite similar to copy tasks, that previous state should be remembered.\n\nIn the prior work you mention which trains RNNs on a copy task it is likely they were working in a sequence prediction framework rather than reinforcement learning. In sequence prediction the agent would process characters one at a time while outputting a probability distribution for each next character. The training would then proceed by increasing the probability of the correct characters as they are revealed providing a dense signal for improvement. The reinforcement learning framework assumes much less structure in both the problem and the provided feedback than this. The agent is not provided with the correct action at each step as a learning signal, it must instead learn this through trial and error, and rewards for the correct action are not necessarily given immediately but may be delayed as is the case in our problem (particularly in the case of more than one decision state). To train on this task in a manner similar to sequence prediction we would have to assume significantly more structure than the conventional reinforcement learning framework. These factors make the problem significantly more difficult, although it may be superficially similar.\n\nRe:\nAlso, intuitively, this episodic memory method should work better on long-term dependencies task, while this article only shows the task with 10 time-steps. \n\nAppendix E shows a version of the task with 20 time-steps which gives an early indication that it scales quite well with length, we agree scaling to much longer tasks would be informative to explore in the future."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Integrating Episodic Memory into a Reinforcement Learning Agent Using Reservoir Sampling", "abstract": "Episodic memory is a psychology term which refers to the ability to recall specific events from the past.

Rather we build on the body of work which makes use of neural networks acting on external memories which has been shown to be useful in many cases. However, existing work involving external memory in a reinforcement learning or sequence prediction setting usually uses back-propagation through time for training. This requires computation proportional to the history length which is not acceptable in online reinforcement learning, particularly in the continuing learning setting where the history length grows arbitrarily long. If a model uses only recurrent computation this can be remedied to an extent by truncated back-propagation through time, at the cost of biasing the gradients and limiting the effective horizon of the model. \n\nWhen using models which read from and write to external memories however, much of the apparent benefit comes from the ability to easily store information on much longer time scales. In this case it is less clear whether truncating gradients is a viable option and it makes sense to look into other gradient based methods which could work online with an external memory. The main contribution of this work is to present a particular framework for external memory in RL which, through the use of reservoir sampling, can be trained online (in O(n) time in the memory size) with approximate gradients without the need to perform back-propagation through time. For this reason we did not see it as meaningful or worthwhile at this point to compare with the many works which utilize external memories, or similarly temporal attention mechanisms, trained with back-propagation through time. We will make revisions to our introduction along these lines to make the motivation and intended use-case of our algorithm more clear.\n\nThe environment used in the experiments is intentionally simple to allow straightforward analysis and intuitive understanding of what the agent is doing. This is exemplified by the included plots of write weights and queried values which demonstrate that the individual components of our agent are performing as expected. Similar plots would likely not be possible to obtain in a more complex environment. In general we agree with the reviewers that more robust experiments are needed to demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. We see this work as building a conceptual foundation for future work on more realistic environments.\n\nThe RNN baseline provided was in no way meant to be representative of state of the art on problems like the one we explore here, it was only intended to provide context for our main experimental result. The main result being that our external memory mechanism, trained online with no back propagation through time can in fact learn to remember the important states (which for purpose of illustration are known to us ahead of time in this case) in a reinforcement learning problem. With that said we acknowledge that performing a more thorough hyper-parameter sweep would make for a more meaningful baseline, thus we plan do this and add it in a revision once complete.\n\nWe will address remaining concerns to the individual reviews.\n\nWe thank the reviewers again for constructive feedback, and hope that our responses address your concerns."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Integrating Episodic Memory into a Reinforcement Learning Agent Using Reservoir Sampling", "abstract": "Episodic memory is a psychology term which refers to the ability to recall specific events from the past.
