Then the observation based attack and action based attack should be addressed, though deploying these attacks require some access to the policy networks\u2019 software system.

Corollary 2 describes the conclusion that using our optimal frame based selection, we can achieve more efficient attack by attacking frames with larger variance of Q value than attacking frames with smaller variance of Q value. \n\nDiscussion of the frequency of the crashes or other metrics relevant to the task: we tried to decompose the torcs reward into two parts, one is progress reward, namely, how many distance the vehicle traveled, the another one is the reward related with crash. We include the figure in the updated paper\u2019s appendix. This figure shows the individual steps\u2019 reward where the positive and negative rewards with absolute value between 0 and 2 are regular progress reward, and the -2.5 and -3.0 rewards correspond to catastrophe reward, we can see from this figure that our method is able to achieve significant catastrophe attack effects and the potential risk is severe. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications, such as playing computer games and controlling robotic manipulation.

In settings that have been studied previously, the authors show that they can find attacks more effectively than previous approaches can. They also study learning based and online attack generation approaches, that can be effectively used to quickly find adversarial attacks on the agent. The authors validate their approaches experimentally on Mujoco tasks and the TORCS driving simulator.\n\nQuality: I found the paper's contributions difficult to understand - the significance of the three classes of attacks is not properly explained (in particular, I found the action perturbation to be difficult to justify in a real world setting). Further, the difficulty of generating attacks in each of these classes and the need for new algorithms is not explained properly. The need for effective ways to quickly generate adversarial attacks in RL is clear, but the authors' experiments don't seem to clarify that their proposed aproaches achieve this goal.\n\nClarity: The organization of section 4 makes the paper difficult to read - I would separate the taxonomy from the contribution of novel ways of generating adversarial attacks (the latter, imo, is the more significant contribution). \n\nOriginality: To the best of my knowledge, the authors propose novel kinds of attacks as well as novel attack algorithms on RL agent.\n\nSignificance: The problem considered is certainly significant. Despite the successes achieved by DeepRL, their robustness (in terms of distribution shifts, adversarial noise, model errors etc.) is of great importance when considering deploying these models. However, the presentation and experiments leave me unconvinced that the presented approaches are  a significant step ahead in attack generation (particularly in ways to generate attacks that can efficiently be incorporated into adversarial training of RL agents).\n\nCons\n1. Unclear presentation of technical contributions, experimental results do not support the key contributions of faster attack generation\n2. I am also unconvinced of the relevance of blackbox attack algorithms given the nascent stage of deepRL - since these agents are just being developed and their abilities need to improve significantly before they become deployable (and blackbox adversarial attacks are a real concern), I feel this work is premature and will need to be redone once more capable/robust agents can be trained for practical RL settings\n\n###\nIn light of the revision, I have revised my score given the rewriting of section 3 that addresses the second con I raised above.

The main limitation of this paper is probably its broad scope, which unfortunately prevents it in its current form from addressing each of the goals stated in the introduction systematically to draw conclusive takeaways. \n\nTaxonomizing the space of adversaries targeting deep RL at test time is a valuable contribution. While the existing taxonomy is a good start, it would be useful if you can clarify the following points in your rebuttal. Why were the \u201cfurther categorization\u201d items separated from adversarial capabilities? Being constrained to real-time or physical perturbations appears to be another way to describe the adversary\u2019s capabilities. In addition, is there a finer-grained way to characterize the adversary\u2019s knowledge beyond white-box vs. black-box? This binary perspective is common but not very informative. One way to move forward would be for instance to think about the different components of a RL system, and identify those that are relevant to have knowledge of when adversaries are mounting attacks. It would also be helpful to position prior work in the taxonomy. Finally, the taxonomy currently stated in the submissions is more a taxonomy of attacks (or adversaries) than a taxonomy of vulnerabilities, so the title of Section 3 could perhaps be updated accordingly. \n\nSection 4.1 gives a good overview of different attack strategies against RL based on modifying the observations analyzed by the agent. Many of these attacks are applications of known attack strategies and will be familiar to readers with adversarial ML background (albeit some of these strategies were previously introduced and evaluated against \u201csupervised\u201d classifiers only). One point was unclear however: why is the imitation learning based black-box attack not a transferability-based attack? As far as I could understand, the strategy described corresponds exactly to the commonly adopted strategy of transferring adversarial examples found on a substitute model (see for instance \u201cIntriguing properties of neural networks\u201d by Szegedy et al. and \u201cPractical Black-Box Attacks against Machine Learning\u201d by Papernot et al.). In other words, Section 4.1 could be rescoped to put emphasis on the attack strategies that have not been explored previously in the context of reinforcement learning: e.g., the finite difference approach with adaptive sampling or the universal attack with optimal selection of initial frames. It is unfortunate that the treatment of these two attacks is currently deferred to the appendix as they make the paper more informative. Similarly, Sections 4.2 and 4.3 would benefit from being extended to put forward the new attack threat model considered in these two sections. \n\nWhile the introduction claimed to make a systematic evaluation of attacks against RL, the presentation of the experimental section can be improved to ensure the analysis points out the relevant takeaways. For instance, it is unclear what the differences are between results on TORCS and other tasks included in the Appendix. Specifically, results on Enduro do not seem as conclusive as those presented on TORCS. Do you have some intuition as to why that is the case? In Figure 7, it appears that a large number of frames need to be manipulated before a drop on cumulative reward is noticeable. Previous efforts manipulated single frames only, could you stress why the setting is different here? Throughout the section, many Figures are small and it is difficult to infer whether the difference between the white-box and black-box variants of an attack is significant or not. Could you analyze this in more details in the text? In Table 2, how should the L2 distance be interpreted? In other words, when is the adversary successful? \n\nIf you can clarify any of the points made above in your rebuttal, I am of course open to revise my review. \n\nEditorial details: \nFigures are not readable when printed. \nFigure 5 is improperly referenced in the main body of the paper. \nFigure 7: label is incorrect for Torcs and Hopper (top of figure)\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications, such as playing computer games and controlling robotic manipulation.

We have restructured our introduction to highlight these, from the revised list of contributions: (2) We propose two practical strategies, N-attack and online sequential attack, for performing real-time attacks on DRL systems; (3) We introduce the first attack that adversarially perturbs a DRL system\u2019s environment dynamics, and the first attack that perturbs a DRL system\u2019s actions; (5) We propose a method to select the optimal frames within consecutive frames to attack to achieve optimal attack effect and provide the mathematical analysis for that; and (6) We devise and evaluate 10 new attacks on several DRL environments. Note that only obs-fgsm-wb and obs-fgsm-bb are the existing attacks on DRL.\n\nQ: Connections of each attack setting to real world application scenario?\nA: We now add corresponding discussions in section 3 about how each category of the attacks within the taxonomy can be realistic in real world. In particular, we discuss the realistic scenarios of the attacks on observation, action space and attacks on environment dynamics. For attacks on observation space, the perturbations are added on observations such as images. When the agent learns the policy entirely in simulation, software virus can be installed into the rendering environments or the physical simulator such that the observed state can be modified. When the agent gets observations from real world, such as in autonomous model car, sometimes the observations are captured on the vehicle and then transmitted wirelessly to a remote computer to get the control signal. Some wireless communication techniques such as bluetooth are vulnerable to potential attacks. Therefore the pixel values can be modified by interfering the transmitted wireless signal. For attacks on action space, if the agent gets control signals wirelessly from some control center and does not compute the action locally, then the control signal can be modified by some attackers by interfering the transmitted wireless signal. Attacks on environmental dynamics can be achieved by changing the environment transition dynamics. For example, change the road surface friction coefficient will change the transition dynamics for autonomous driving car. \n\nQ: Which attack is likely to be performed by what kind of adversaries in what situation?\nA: When introducing each attack method, we now provide the settings these attacks are suitable for. For example, white-box attack obs-fgsm-wb requires full access to the policy network\u2019s architecture and parameters and can query the network. We now also add these settings to table 1 under \u201cattacker knowledge\u201d, where we provide the information for each attack method whether it needs to have access to the policy network\u2019s architecture, parameters or to query the network. In section 4, within the introduction for each attack, we also discuss these settings.\n\nQ: It\u2019s important for security analysis to learn about the worst case. This work does not give a deep insight into what we should do to make RL secure. \nA: We agree that attack algorithm development should give insight about the worst case and insight about how to make RL secure. These proposed attack methods can be integrated into the training of RL policies to improve the policy\u2019s robustness. For example, environment dynamics attack method can be used to perturb the training environment so as to find some challenging environments or find ways to cause catastrophe, and help to explore the worst case. These methods can also provide evaluation benchmarks to measure RL policies\u2019 robustness once they are full trained. We now add a paragraph in section 6 discussing the connection of our work with robust RL training. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications, such as playing computer games and controlling robotic manipulation.

For each of our proposed methods, we now discuss the realistic settings where these methods can be applied in section 3.\n\nQ: Why were the \u201cfurther categorization\u201d items separated from adversarial capabilities? And provide finer-grained way to characterize the adversary\u2019s knowledge beyond white-box v.s. Black-box? Also talk about prior work in taxonomy. \nA: Sorry for the confusion of further categorization. We realize that adversarial capability is not an appropriate phrase to describe the first layer of categorization so we use the component of the MDP to be attacked. Then we provide further categorization on black-box and white-box method. Specifically, we classify black-box and white-box methods based on the detailed knowledge of the attacker has on the victim policy: whether the attacker knows the policy network\u2019s architecture, weight parameters, and whether the attacker can query the policy network. We also introduced prior work in generating adversarial attacks on RL.\n\nQ: The taxonomy currently stated in the submissions is more a taxonomy of attacks (or adversaries) than a taxonomy of vulnerabilities\nA: We changed section 3\u2019s title to be \u201ctaxonomy of attacks on DRL\u201d. \n\nQ: why is the imitation learning based black-box attack not a transferability-based attack?\nA: You are correct, that the imitation learning based attack is also a transferability attack. We continue to distinguish the case where the local model is distilled as opposed to trained separately, but we have removed the text that suggests that it is not a transferability attack.\nIn addition, the transferability based attack requires access to the environment\u2019s state space, action space, transition dynamics and reward function to train a new policy. However, our imitation learning based attack only requires access to the environment\u2019s state, action space and transition dynamics. We do not learn the new policy using reinforcement learning so we do not need to know the reward function. \n\nQ: It is unfortunate that the treatment of the proposed new attacks is currently deferred to the appendix as they make the paper more informative\nA: We put more emphasis on our proposed attacks and put the mathematical analysis back in the paper. \n\nQ: Differences between results on different environments? Results on Enduro do not seem as conclusive as those presented on TORCS. Do you have some intuition as to why that is the case?\nA: We don\u2019t observe much difference between the results on different environments per se. The reason we only put TORCS results in the paper is due to the limit of the number of allowed pages. The reason why the Enduro\u2019s results seem to be different from TORCS results is that the attack perturbation threshold is larger on the TORCS environment, since TORCS is a more complex driving environment than Enduro, so in order to achieve reasonably good attack performance the perturbation strength will be larger. But this won\u2019t affect our conclusion. \n\nQ: In Figure 7, it appears that a large number of frames need to be manipulated before a drop on cumulative reward is noticeable.\nA: The cumulative reward in figure 7 is aligned to the beginning of the episode, where no perturbation is applied. The teal lines, for example, represent experiments where the perturbation begins to be applied after frame 160. We mark where the perturbation begins to be applied with a dot, and in our experiments, the cumulative reward immediately diverges from the non-adversarial experiment. Previous experiments also didn\u2019t only manipulate one image. Actually all images are perturbed after the first k frames, and the first k frames are used to estimate this universal perturbation. \n\nQ: Many figures are small, difficult to infer the difference between white-box and black-box variants is significant or not. \nA: We have added analysis in Section 6 about the difference between white-box and black-box results and what they indicate. We also tried to enlarge the figure size so that you can clearly see the difference. White-box methods have better or similar performance than black-box methods. However, white-box methods\u2019 application scenario is very limited while black-box methods can be more powerful even we have limited knowledge about the victim policy. \n\nQ: In Table 2, how should the L2 distance be interpreted?\nA: In table 2, the L2 distance is a measure of the difference between the achieved state and the target state. We\u2019ve clarified this in our revision. The measure is ad-hoc, but we also include a graphical example of an achieved state in figure 4. The adversary is successful if the target attack has qualitatively been achieved.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications, such as playing computer games and controlling robotic manipulation.

For attacks on observations or actions in a self driving car scenario, the attacker may induce the car to select some malicious actions to collide into obstacles such as pedestrians, which will cause severe traffic accidents. For attacks on environment dynamics, self driving car policy may fail if the dynamics are perturbed by changing some environment conditions, such as road friction coefficient. We now add discussions in section 3 about the action perturbation in real world setting. For example, when a robot is controlled remotely by a control center, the robot itself does not calculate the action locally, but the action signal is transmitted wirelessly from the control center via techniques like bluetooth. Therefore, interference on the bluetooth signal can be used to induce the robot to perform some malicious action. This is a real concern and we also add citations in the paper. \n\nQ: the difficulty of generating attacks in each of these classes and the need for new algorithms is not explained properly.\nA: generating white-box attacks has rigorous requirements for the victim policy: we have to know its architecture and parameters, which makes it difficult to apply attacks in real world settings, where we usually don\u2019t have that access. Traditional black-box method such as transferability based attack does not always work pretty well and we have already shown this in the paper. The transferability based attack obs-fgsm-wb and imitation learning based attack obs-imi-bb all require access to the original training environment, which may not be practical in real world scenarios. So we need some new algorithms that can work in real world settings (not necessarily have access to the entire training environment, not necessarily have the original policy\u2019s structure and parameters) and have reasonably good performance. Therefore, we propose black box attacks based on finite difference to estimate gradient, and several variants of FD based method that improves the efficiency of generating the attack so that the attack can be applied in real time. \n\nQ: clarify proposed attack achieves attacks faster than vanilla finite difference method?\nA: We now include this in our section 5.2 that sampling based finite difference method uses less number of query than vanilla finite difference method but achieves similar performance. Specifically, we provide the number of queries for the finite difference, sampling based finite difference method to show that our sampling based finite difference method achieves similar attack performance but uses significantly less number of queries. (around 50% deduction in the number of queries times). \n\nQ: Clarity of section 4: separate taxonomy from the contribution of novel ways of generating adversarial attacks\nA:  We now include the taxonomy in section 3, and in section 4, we mainly talk about our proposed attack methods\n\nQ: confused whether the proposed approaches are a significant step towards better attack generation, particularly how to make RL robust using our presented approaches\nA: We now add the discussion about how our proposed attacks can be useful for the adversarial training of RL agents in our section 6. For example, the black-box environment dynamics attack method can be incorporated into the training of RL agents to generate adversarial environment. Previous method such as Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) (Pinto et al., ICML 2017) manually generates the attack while here we automatically generate environment dynamics attack using reinforcement learning. \n\nQ: The work is premature and will need to be redone once more robust agents are available in practical RL settings\nA: Recently, deep RL has been deployed in the real world, such as RL based computer games (AlphaGo), RL based robots, etc. Therefore, it\u2019s very important to develop attack method to evaluate the robustness of the RL policies to ensure they can be safely deployed. However, current methods based on transferability still haves suboptimal performance and have strong assumptions about the knowledge of the victim policy, which may not be realistic in real world scenarios. Therefore, we proposed more novel and efficient black-box attack methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications, such as playing computer games and controlling robotic manipulation.

Even in such a situation, a rescue for attack scenario A might not be needed if attack scenario A is not realistic at all. Even if connections to threats in the real world is not clear, it would be important for security analysis to learn about the worst case. Unfortunately, this work simply exhibits a catalogue of attacks against RL and does not give a deep insight into what we should do to make RL secure. \n\nThe summarization of the attack scenarios against RL is high quality and the results shown in this paper would be useful for many researchers.

We conduct extensive experiments to compare the effectiveness of different attacks with several baseline attack methods in several game playing, robotics control, and autonomous driving environments.", "keywords": [], "authorids": ["xiaocw@umich.edu", "xinleipan@berkeley.edu", "_w@eecs.berkeley.edu", "lxbosky@gmail.com", "jianpeng@illinois.edu", "sunmj15@mails.tsinghua.com", "jinfengyi.ustc@gmail.com", "mingyan@umich.edu", "dawnsong@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Chaowei Xiao", "Xinlei Pan", "Warren He", "Bo Li", "Jian Peng", "Mingjie Sun", "Jinfeng Yi", "Mingyan Liu", "Dawn Song."], "pdf": "/pdf/e7e48c995bd46e04da8b6adc7d2decdd22f4ea92.pdf", "paperhash": "xiao|characterizing_attacks_on_deep_reinforcement_learning", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nxiao2019characterizing,\ntitle={Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Chaowei Xiao and Xinlei Pan and Warren He and Bo Li and Jian Peng and Mingjie Sun and Jinfeng Yi and Mingyan Liu and Dawn Song.},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryewE3R5YX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1460/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234225074, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "ryewE3R5YX", "replyto": "ryewE3R5YX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335951329, "tmdate": 1552335951329, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1460/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 16}
