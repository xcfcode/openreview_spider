Although the individual components are similar to previous work, they are combined in a novel way that shows a path toward longer and more efficient context lengths.\n\nPositives\n---------\nIncreasing the context length of transformers is an interesting and relevant topic, and the proposed solution can have real impact in moving the state of the art forward.\n\nThe results demonstrated in the experiments show an improvement over previous models.\n\nThe paper is clear and detailed, and well situated in the literature.  The algorithms were clear and the comments were useful for understanding the proposed idea.\n\nNegatives\n---------\nThe experiments do not compare to many other approaches, even though those approaches are cited throughout the paper.  In the conclusion, the paper mentions comparison with Multi-Scale approaches, but that is not present in the experiments.  Since the architecture (ignoring the compression) is similar to multi-scale approaches, it would be good to compare against empirically.\n\nAlthough the complexity analysis is thorough, I'd like to see empirical results of memory/compute requirements as a function of the context length.  If I understand correctly, the sub-linear results depend on particular settings of the memory length and compression rate.  How do the settings used in the experiments compare to those used for the analysis?  Is there a perplexity/efficiency tradeoff, and can you characterize that experimentally?\n\nReasons for Score\n-----------------\nThe idea proposed in the paper is novel and exciting, but I have some concerns about whether the gains promised by the theoretical analysis can be realized while maintaining modeling quality.\n\nMinor issues that did not affect score\n------------------\nFigure 1 has some scaling/resolution issues that make it hard to read.

The network processes the information defining multiple temporal scales, with finer scales for nearby elements, and coarser scales for distant information. It also includes the recurrent memory extension from Transformer-XL from Dai et al. The model is tested in a long range language modeling task.\n \n==================\n\nThe presented Transformer-QL model improves over similar previous methods on language modeling. A thorough complexity analysis is included. The presentation can be improved, all the definitions are hard to follow. The layers are described in a textual fashion, barely any math (and extended in the pseudo-code). Further, the performance improvements are nice, though not impressive. \n\n==================\n\nThe paper is hard to follow for moments. For example, a Figure to define what are $n_s, n_c, n_m$ would help to understand the paper with a nice visual benefit. Introducing the layer and networks in a simple way would help clarify the implementation and other notation.\n\nThe paper describes the idea of multiple temporal scales. In the experimental sections, it seems that only two scales are used. What would happen if the number of scales is increased to capture  longer contexts? Would the method gain in performance? Further, how does the network perform when a longer context is obtained *maintaining the same number of parameters* as a network with less temporal scales? \n\nThe motivation behind Transformer-QL is to increase the context length processed beyond what other methods can. I agree with the authors that extending the context is important. How effective is the method to capture farther long-term dependencies compared to previous methods? The experimental results mainly address similar networks with similar context lengths. \nThis could be tested by ablating elements from the input or ablating the recurrent memory vectors (setting them to zero during inference).\n\nWhat would happen to the network if compression is removed? \n\n==================\n\nMy score is based on the clarity improvements needed and the lack of evaluation of the effectiveness on the main objective of the method (longer contexts). I would appreciate if the authors can reply to my questions above.\n\n==================\n\nMinor issues:\n\n-Section 2.1: \u201cinput sequence are\u201d -> \u201cinput sequences are\u201d\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper747/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper747/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transformer-QL: A Step Towards Making Transformer Network Quadratically Large", "authorids": ["~Suvadeep_Hajra1"], "authors": ["Suvadeep Hajra"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "language model", "transformer network", "multi-scale transformer network", "natural language processing", "transformer-xl"], "abstract": "Transformer networks have shown outstanding performance on many natural language processing tasks.

However the context length (the number of previous tokens on which the output states depend) of a Transformer network grows at best linearly with the memory and computational power used. This limitation prevents a transformer network to have very long context in a resource limited application. In this work, we propose a class of transformer networks, namely Transformer-QL (\\bf{Q}uadratically \\bf{L}arge), in which, the context length can grow at best quadratically with the memory and computational power used. We have empirically evaluated a Transformer-QL model in three long range language modeling datasets.
