This is accomplished using explicit group representations to derive the equivariant kernels and nonlinearities. We present two contributions motivated by frontier applications of equivariance beyond rotations and translations. First, we relax the requirement for explicit Lie group representations, presenting a novel algorithm that finds irreducible representations of noncommutative Lie groups given only the structure constants of the associated Lie algebra. Second, we demonstrate that Lorentz-equivariance is a useful prior for object-tracking tasks and construct the first object-tracking model equivariant to the Poincar\u00e9 group.", "pdf": "/pdf/8b5762d8f7f35d13fb1acce928e1c8641d9e3a65.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|learning_irreducible_representations_of_noncommutative_lie_groups", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021learning,\ntitle={Learning Irreducible Representations of Noncommutative Lie Groups},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=3P8sa4tzniU},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
