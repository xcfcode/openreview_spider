In this metric, the authors used GAN-generated samples to train a classifier and then apply it on real test set. The classification accuracy on real test set is regarded as a good signal to indicate the performance of generators. \n\n[comment]\n\nThis paper presented a new metric GQI. It seems reasonable. However, this kind of metric has been proposed by previous paper:\n\nLR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01560.pdf \n\nIn the above paper,  the authors proposed to use adversarial accuracy and adversarial divergence evaluate the generators, which also trained a classifier based on the generated samples. The difference is that they trained generators for all categories separately, and thus could directly generate categorical samples, instead of using another classifier to classify the generated samples. I think this way is more reasonable than the one used in this paper. \n\nConsidering the above reference, I think the novelty in this paper discounts much. It would be nice for the authors to make more comprehensive comparison with previous evaluation metrics scattered in different papers.
