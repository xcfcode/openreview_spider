For scheme-A, the authors show the performance of the student network under many low precision regimes and different depths of teacher networks. One observation not discussed by the authors is that the performance of the student network under each low precision regime doesn't improve with deeper teacher networks (see Table 1, 2 & 3). As a matter of fact, under some scenarios performance even decreases. \n\nThe authors do not discuss the gains of their best low-precision regime in terms of computation and memory.\n\nFinally, the true applications for models with a low memory footprint are not necessarily related to image classification models (e.g. ImageNet-1k).

However, compared to prior works the improvement is significant. For example, now with 8-bits activations and 4-bits weight, ResNet-34 without any change in network architecture is only 0.5% off from baseline full precision. This is currently the best Top-1 figure at this precision knob -- the best figure with prior techniques gave 3.3% degradation (so 2.8% improvement with our scheme). We believe that by making the models slightly larger (by 10% or so) we can close the gap between low-precision and full-precision networks -- this is our future work.\n\nTransferability: We believe, this aspect should not change with our scheme for low-precision settings -- we simply better the accuracy of a given network at low-precision (compared to prior proposals). However much the network was useful in transfer learning scenarios with low-precision tensors before, the network right now with our scheme would be similarly useful (if at all better when compared to prior works since we achieve a better accuracy with low-precision).\n\nYour question: Is it possible to transfer student-teacher training practices to other tasks?\nAlthough we did not focus on this aspect in this paper, we found the following 3 works (not an exhaustive list) that use the student-teacher training procedure for other deep-learning domains:\n\n1.

Simultaneous Deep Transfer Across Domains and Tasks, Eric Tzeng et al., ICCV 2015.\n\n\nThe observation that accuracy does not improve when using bigger teacher network(s): We allude to this in Discussion part of Section 5.2 (page-8). We mention that the accuracy improvement saturates at some point. We will elaborate on this aspect in the final version of the paper.\n\nWe will also discuss the merits of low precision on savings in compute and memory.

They are useful. \n\nWe defend our contribution aspect below:\n\nContributions: Distillation along with lowering precision has not been studied before. We show benefits of this combined approach - both distillation and low precision target model compression aspect - but when combined the benefits are significant. We also show how one can use the combined distillation and lowering precision approach to training as well as fine-tuning.\n\nOur approach achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy over prior proposals and using our approach we significantly close the gap between full-precision and low-precision model accuracy. We demonstrate the benefits on ImageNet with large networks (ResNet). For example, with ResNet-50 on ImageNet, prior work showed 4.7% accuracy degradation with 8-bits activation and 4-bits weight. We lower this gap to less than 1.5%.\n\nWe believe ours to be the first work that targets both model compression (using knowledge distillation) and low-precision.\n\n\nResponse to the Cons aspects:\n1. We probably did not do a good job describing why we call our approach Apprentice. We will fix this and disambiguate from apprenticeship-based learning schemes.\n\n2. The reason we focus on sub 8-bit precision is that model inference with 8-bits is becoming mainstream and we seek to target next-gen hardware architectures. Also, from a hardware point-of-view 8-bits, 4-bits and 2-bits simplify design (e.g. alignment across cache line boundaries and memory accesses vs. 3-bits or 5-bits precision for example). \n\n3. We had tried the scheme you mention in (3) but the results were not (as) good compared to the schemes we mention in the paper, hence we omitted this scheme from our paper. \n\nWe experimented with ResNet-18 with (a) first, compressing using distillation scheme (used ResNet-34 as the teacher network) and then (b) lowered the precision to ternary mode (fine-tuning for 35 epochs with low learning rate). This experiment was done for ImageNet-1K dataset. This experiment is a variation of scheme-C in our paper where we start with full-precision networks and jointly fine-tune (use distillation scheme with warm start-up).\nActivation precision was 8-bits for this experiment. The ResNet-18 network converged to 33.13% Top-1 error rate. Comparing this with \"jointly\" compressing and lowering precision while training from scratch, we get 32.0% Top-1 error rate (Table-1, 4th row and 2nd column). So, our Apprentice scheme for this network and configuration is 1.13% better.\n\nYour point is well taken and we will include results where first we use knowledge distillation scheme to generate a smaller ResNet model and then lower the precision and fine-tune this small model. Currently, we have results of this scheme with ResNet-18 and few precision knobs and will collect results with this scheme for ResNet-34 and ResNet-50 for the final paper version.\nAs mentioned above, the conclusions of our paper would not change and the new results will show the benefits of joint training with distillation (Apprentice scheme). Many works proposing low-precision knobs advocate for training from scratch or training with warm-startup (from weights at full-precision numerics) -- our work is in line with these observations.\n\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Apprentice: Using Knowledge Distillation Techniques To Improve Low-Precision Network Accuracy", "abstract": "Deep learning networks have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on computer vision workloads like image classification and object detection.

We will fix this.\n\nFuture directions for research:\n1. We are currently pursuing the extension of the ideas in this paper to RNNs. Our preliminary studies on a language model for PTB dataset showed promise and based on this we are evaluating a larger data set and model like Deep Speech-2.\n2. Some works proposing low-precision networks advocate for making the layers wider (or the model larger) to recover accuracy at low-precision. These works propose making the layers wider by 2x or 3x. While these works show the benefits of low-precision, making the model larger increases the number of raw computations. Future work could investigate low-precision and less layer widening factor (say 1.10x or 1.25x or ...). This would help inference latency while maintaining accuracy at-par with baseline full-precision.\n3. Another interesting line of investigation for future work is looking into sparsifying networks at low-precision while maintaining baseline level accuracy and using knowledge distillation scheme during this process. As mentioned in Sec 5.5 in our paper, sparsifying a model more than a certain percentage leads to accuracy loss. Investigating hyper-sparse network models without accuracy loss using distillation based schemes is an interesting avenue of further research.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Apprentice: Using Knowledge Distillation Techniques To Improve Low-Precision Network Accuracy", "abstract": "Deep learning networks have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on computer vision workloads like image classification and object detection. The performant systems, however, typically involve big models with numerous parameters. Once trained, a challenging aspect for such top performing models is deployment on resource constrained inference systems -- the models (often deep networks or wide networks or both) are compute and memory intensive. Low precision numerics and model compression using knowledge distillation are popular techniques to lower both the compute requirements and memory footprint of these deployed models. In this paper, we study the combination of these two techniques and show that the performance of low precision networks can be significantly improved by using knowledge distillation techniques.
