Since the main focus of our paper lies in the theoretical side, we have not performed these two methods on the real datasets. We leave this to future work. To the best of our knowledge, Belkin et al. [1] showed the Laplace kernel has similar performance in fitting random labels as neural networks. Geifman et al.

I wonder whether the theoretical results proposed are helpful to improve the performance of Laplace kernel or NTK. \n\nA: Thank you for the suggestion! We made some partial results on the behavior of the NTK and the Laplace kernel outside of the unit sphere, which shows that the ReLU NTK is equivalent to a homogeneous Laplace kernel in the whole space. We will present these results in our follow-up work. \n\nQ: The author demonstrates that a non-smooth exponential power kernel leads to a larger RKHS, but whether this indicates that the model obtained by adopting a non-smooth kernel has greater generalization capability. I think the author needs to further theoretically illustrate the relationship between them.\n\nA: Thank you for pointing out this interesting question. The relationship between them is as follows. Our results show that using a more non-smooth exponential power kernel leads to a larger RKHS and therefore greater expressive power. However, analyzing the generalization error requires more efforts in general. Researchers often use the RKHS norm to provide an upper bound for it. The follow-up work that we are working on shows that we can also derive the RKHS norm from the singularity analysis and thereby give an upper bound on the generalization error.

We have incorporated the changes into the revised paper, and address the issues in detail here:\n\nQ: In Section 2.1, the original Laplace kernels and exponential power kernels are all classic shift-invariant kernels. Here the authors provided the dot-product versions of these two kernels. Why do the authors need to do these changes? For the sphere, the shift-invariant versions are equivalent to the dot-product kernels?\n\nA: Yes, on the sphere, the shift-invariant kernels are dot product kernels. If $k(\\|x-y\\|)$ is a shift-invariant kernel, then we have $k(\\|x-y\\|)=k(\\sqrt{\\|x-y\\|^2}) = k(\\sqrt{\\|x\\|^2+\\|y\\|^2-2x^\\top y}) = k(\\sqrt{2-2x^\\top y})$. We use $\\|x\\|=\\|y\\|=1$ ($x$ and $y$ are on the sphere) in the last equality. We can see that it is a function of $x^\\top y$ and therefore a dot-product kernel. We expressed it as a dot-product kernel in order to analyze the decay rate of its power series coefficients and determine its RKHS. \n\nQ: Under Lemma 3, if $\\Sigma_k(x,x)=1$, we can only get $\\Sigma_k(u)=\\Sigma_{k-1}(u)$. \n\nA: Thank you for the great point. Plugging $\\Sigma_k(x,x)=1$ into Eq. (2), we get $\\Sigma_k(u) = \\kappa_1(\\Sigma_{k-1}(u))$. By induction, we obtain $\\Sigma_k(u) = \\kappa_1^{(k)}(u)$. We present a detailed derivation of Eq.(4) in Appendix A.2. in the revision. \n\nQ: What does the notation $\\kappa_1^{(k)}$ means here?\n\nA: Thank you for pointing it out. We define it right below Eq. (4). It means the $k$-th iterated composition of $\\kappa_1(u)$. For example, $\\kappa_1^{(0)}(u)=u$, $\\kappa_1^{(1)}(u)=\\kappa_1(u)$ and $\\kappa_1^{(2)}(u) = \\kappa_1(\\kappa_1(u))$. We clarified it in the revision. \n\nQ: Theorem 1 in (Aronszajn, 1950, p. 354) just stated that if $K_1\\preccurlyeq K_2$, then $\\mathcal{K}_1\\subseteq \\mathcal{K_2}$. I am very curious and doubting about Lemma 4. For any positive constant $\\gamma>0$, does Lemma 4 always exist?\n\nA: Theorem 2.17 of Saitoh & Sawano (the second reference in the parentheses) states exactly Lemma 4. In fact, Aronszajn\u2019s version is equivalent because $\\gamma^2 \\mathcal{K}_2$ has the same RKHS as $\\mathcal{K}_2$ (the positive constant does not influence the RKHS). We cited (Aronszajn 1950) because to the best of our knowledge, it is the original literature. \n\nQ: I cannot find the original documents of (Schoenberg, 1942) and (Cheney and Light, 2009). Could you please provide these results in the Appendix such that we can check the correctness of these results? \n\nA: Thank you for the great point. In Lemma 5 in the revision, we restated these results from the original documents.\n\nQ: In Section 3, I have two doubting points. The first one is under the definition of $\\Delta$-domain. The authors used $z$ to replace $u$ and $u=x^{\\top}y$ as shown Section 2.1. If we put $u=x^{\\top}y=1$, the Laplace kernels and exponential power kernels given in Section 2.1 will all become constant. Could the authors explain more about this assumption?\n\nA: We are sorry for this confusion. The condition that $x$ and $y$ live on the unit sphere means $x^{\\top}x=y^{\\top}y=1$. This cannot imply $x^{\\top}y=1$. Actually $x^{\\top}y$ can be any real number in the interval $[-1,1]$. We emphasized this in the footnote of Lemma 5 in our revision.\n\nQ: The second one is under Lemma 5. The authors stated that \"Careful singularity analysis then gives ...\". It is very difficult for me to easily get these two results about Maclaurin coefficients. Could you give the detailed steps for the derivation of these results?\n\nA: Thank you for your comments. In this section, we present an overview of our proof for Theorem 1. Careful singularity analysis refers to Section 3.1 and Section 3.2. The detailed proofs for Theorem 6 and 7 in Section 3.1 and 3.2 are referred to in the Appendix. We added some clarification before Section 3.1 in our revision.\n\nQ: In Theorem 2, I am very curious about the seemingly contrary results: $H_{K_{\\text{exp }}^{\\gamma_1, \\sigma_1}} \\left(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\\right) \\subseteq H_{K_{\\text{exp }}^{\\gamma_2, \\sigma_2}}\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\\right)$ and $H_{K_{\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\gamma_2, \\sigma_2}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right) \\subseteq H_{K_{\\mathrm{exp}}^{\\gamma_1, \\sigma_1}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right).$ Could you provide more explanations about this point in Section 4. The superficial explanations cannot help us understand this point. We need to go deeper into the proof sketch to figure out what makes this phenomenon happen.\n\nA: We are sorry about this confusion. Thank you for pointing it out. This is a typo in our manuscript. Both statements should be $H_{K_\\text{exp}^{\\gamma_2, \\sigma_2}} \\subseteq H_{K_\\text{exp}^{\\gamma_1, \\sigma_1}} $, which means a smaller $\\gamma$  leads to a larger RKHS. We corrected this in our revision.\n\nThank you so much again for your detailed comments. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to comment.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1340/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1340/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Neural Tangent Kernel and Laplace Kernel Have the Same RKHS", "authorids": ["~Lin_Chen14", "~Sheng_Xu5"], "authors": ["Lin Chen", "Sheng Xu"], "keywords": ["Neural tangent kernel", "Reproducing kernel Hilbert space", "Laplace kernel", "Singularity analysis"], "abstract": "We prove that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) of a deep neural tangent kernel and the Laplace kernel include the same set of functions, when both kernels are restricted to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.

The main results are when these kernels are restricted to the unit sphere. In particular, the authors show that, as vector spaces, the RKHS on the unit sphere of the NTK for a ReLU network of any fixed depth are the same and in fact coincides with that of the Laplace kernel. The authors also compare the RKHS for exponential power kernels, demonstrating that larger powers lead to smaller Hilbert spaces. \n\nStrong Points: \n1. Understanding the NTK of a deep ReLU networks is a popular and important topic. \n2. The NTK is defined via non-linear recursions, meaning that obtaining quantitative results for deep networks is both technically and conceptually challenging. \n3. Proving that the RKHS of the Laplace and ReLU kernels coincides as vectors spaces is a substantial result.  \n4. The authors are the first, to my knowledge, to apply the rather elegant singularity analysis of Flajolet-Sedgewick to study the NTK. Perhaps the closes prior work used free probability to study the spectrum of the NTK. \n5. The paper is clearly written.\n\nWeak Points:\n1. As the authors themselves allude to in the discussion, showing that two RKHS are the same as vector spaces ignores the Hilbert spaces structure and can still lead to different inductive biases in kernel regression.\n2. The present work applies only to ReLU networks, while the recursive definition of the NTK is valid for rather general non-linearities. \n\nOverall, this article is a solid theoretical contribution to our understanding of the NTK. In addition to proving concrete results comparing the Laplace, NTK, and exponential power kernels, it is serves as a proof-of-concept for potentially using the tools of singularity analysis to understand neural networks.

In summary, the paper is well-written and organized logically. The proof of theoretical results of this paper seems to be correct and reasonable, resulting from the full details of the proof provided in the appendices. \nThe contribution of this paper includes two parts. Firstly, it aims to explain why the Laplace kernel and NTK have similar performance in experiments from theoretical point of view by showing that the space of the Laplace kernel and NTK are the same when limited to a sphere. On the other hand, the author reveals the relationship between the smoothness of the exponential power kernel and the corresponding RKHS to explain the better performance of the exponential kernel with a smaller power in the experiments. \nNow I would like to give some comments, 1. Do Laplace kernel and NTK have a similar learning dynamic when we perform kernelized gradient decent in real-world dataset? 2. It is necessary to study the behavior of the NTK and the Laplace kernel outside of $S^{d-1}$. I wonder whether the theoretical results proposed are helpful to improve the performance of Laplace kernel or NTK. 3. The author demonstrates that a non-smooth exponential power kernel leads to a larger RKHS, but whether this indicates that the model obtained by adopting a non-smooth kernel has greater generalization capability. I think the author needs to further theoretically illustrate the relationship between them.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1340/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1340/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Neural Tangent Kernel and Laplace Kernel Have the Same RKHS", "authorids": ["~Lin_Chen14", "~Sheng_Xu5"], "authors": ["Lin Chen", "Sheng Xu"], "keywords": ["Neural tangent kernel", "Reproducing kernel Hilbert space", "Laplace kernel", "Singularity analysis"], "abstract": "We prove that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) of a deep neural tangent kernel and the Laplace kernel include the same set of functions, when both kernels are restricted to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.

The main result is twofold: 1) the RKHSes associated with a NTK and a Laplacian kernel  contain the same set of functions when restricted to the sphere S^{d-1}; and 2) the RKHS generated by the exponential kernel with a smaller power contains more functions when restricted to the sphere S^{d-1} or R^d.\n\nThe key proof idea involves an analysis  the asymptotic rates of the Maclaurin coefficients of the kernels. Aronszajn\u2019s lemma is then used to establish the inclusion of the RKHS. A notable contribution in the proof is the application of analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic rate O(n^{-3/2}) of the Maclaurin coefficients of the NTK which is intractable due to its recursive definition.  The authors also provide numerical results showing the empirical rate matches the theoretical asymptotic rate of the Maclaurin coefficients of the Laplace kernel and NTKs.\n\nOverall, I think the paper is well-written, and the proof is solid.  The proof technique using analytic combinatorics seems novel, and the main results are useful for theoretical understanding of neural networks.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1340/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1340/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Neural Tangent Kernel and Laplace Kernel Have the Same RKHS", "authorids": ["~Lin_Chen14", "~Sheng_Xu5"], "authors": ["Lin Chen", "Sheng Xu"], "keywords": ["Neural tangent kernel", "Reproducing kernel Hilbert space", "Laplace kernel", "Singularity analysis"], "abstract": "We prove that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) of a deep neural tangent kernel and the Laplace kernel include the same set of functions, when both kernels are restricted to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.
