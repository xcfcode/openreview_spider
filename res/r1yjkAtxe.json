The importance of this problem cannot be overstated since Hierarchical RL is not only about using a meta-controller to appropriately use a specific skill from a repertoire of previously learned subgoals, but also about devising a set of subgoals through experience. Subgoals are inherently tied to the topology of the underlying problem and hence clustering approaches make sense. \n\nI would like to point out that a very similar attempt has been done in one of the past works in this area - https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05359 - Option Discovery for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning using Spatio-Temporal Clustering. This work presents a spectral method PCCA+ (Perron Cluster Analysis) that identifies abstractions aligned with the topology of the state space as opposed to typical K-means on spectral components (a comparison to other clustering methods has been visually shown to illustrate this). The approach is meant to naturally construct options (macro-actions) from one abstract state to another by ascending on the membership function of each granular state onto the target abstract state. It is shown to work on toy tasks like 3-room and Taxi (see version 1 for taxi) and several other aspects like interpretable termination functions and incorporating reward structure into the abstractions are shown visually.  Finally, an attempt to extend this approach to large state spaces through deep learning representations from unsupervised learning is shown. The idea is essentially the same as one used in this submission - Aggregate the states in original MDP and identify an aggregated state space through clustering (Clustering is done on the representation learned through a recurrent dynamics model). This is followed by applying the spectral method on the aggregated MDP to identify option policies. This pipeline was able to discover subgoals in the complex Atari game Seaquest such as filling oxygen (visually illustrated as well). \n\nI definitely think this paper needs to cite the above work and also have suggestions to investigate a loopy way of identifying the abstractions through developmental learning done on auxiliary tasks. For instance, an initial deep network could just learn to do inverse dynamics or depth prediction or next-state prediction and learn reasonable representations. This could be used to cluster and identify some subgoals to provide an initial policy. This policy gets refined over time with new abstractions and new options. I am curious to see how well this would work for sparse reward tasks. See Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical RL - https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1oK8aoxe (Carlos Florensa, Yan Duan, Pieter Abbeel) for a similar treatment on continuous tasks. Some other tricks could be to not learn prediction of next state, but just have a Siamese Style Network that takes in a triplet of (s,a,s') and predicts whether it is a correct or wrong transition.\n\nAnother interesting direction is to investigate the applicability of these approaches to figuring out perceptual reward functions from a set of expert demonstrations for inverse RL. This is again inspired from another submission to ICLR - Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning (Pierre Sermanet, Kelvin Xu, Sergey Levine) - https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkul3t9ee. They currently use a heuristic method to figure out reward functions by segmenting the video of the expert demo. One could think of the points where the segments are identified as some sort of subgoals of the task being demonstrated. So connecting subgoals with demonstration trajectories is an interesting idea that the authors could explore.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very hard problem to solve. The authors have made a good attempt and I really encourage them to keep working on this.

This is a very important goal from a practical point of view, and it is great to see research in this direction. For this reason, I would like to encourage the authors to pursue this further. However, I am not at all convinced that the current incarnation of this work is the right answer. Part of the issues are more related to presentation, part may require rethinking.\nIn order to get the \"interpretability\", the authors opt for some fairly specific ways of performing abstraction. For example, their skills always start In a single skill initiation state, and likewise end in one state. This seems unnecessarily restrictive, and it is not clear why this restriction is needed (other than convenience). Similarly, clustering is the basis for forming the higher level states, and there is a specific kind of clustering used here. Again, it is not clear why this has to be done via clustering as opposed to other methods. Ensuring temporal coherence in the particular form employed also seems restrictive. There is a reference to supplementary material where some of these choices are explained, but I could not find this in the posted version of the paper. The authors should either explain clearly why these specific choices are necessary, or (even better) try to think if they can be relaxed while still keeping interpretability. \nFrom a presentation point of view, the paper would benefit from formal definitions of AMDP and SAMDP, as well as from formal descriptions of the algorithms employed in constructing these representations (eg Bellman equations for the models, and update rules for the algorithms learning them). While intuitions are given, the math is not precisely stated. The overhead of constructing an SAMDP (computation time and space) should be clarified as well.\nThe experiments are well carried out and it is nice to have both gridworld experiments, where visualization are easy to perform and understand, as well as Atari games (gridworld still have their place despite what other reviewers might say). The results are positive, but because the proposed approach has many moving parts which rely on specific choices, significance and general ease of use are unclear at this point. Perhaps having the complete supplementary would have helped in this respect.\nSmall comment: The two lines after Eq 2 contain typos in the notation and a wrong sign in the equation.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Spatio-Temporal Abstractions in Reinforcement Learning Through Neural Encoding", "abstract": "Recent progress in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled to tackle bigger and more challenging tasks.

There is a big body of literature looking into hierarchical RL methods where lower level skills are combined with higher level policies.

The paper would have been stronger if the authors explicitly stated the contributions over combining existing methods, and better highlighted the practical utility of the method. \n\nThe evaluation section would be made stronger with more analytical results and precise evaluation, showing full strength of the method.\n\nThe paper is difficult to read. To improve readability:\n- The Semi-Aggregated MDP section should include more precise description of the methods. The narrative that builds intuition is welcome. In addition to the existing narrative, algorithms and formulas where applicable should be included as well. \n- The paper should be self-contained. For example, more background on Occams Razor principle should be included.\n- Reduce the number of acronyms, in particular similarly sounding acronyms. Define acronyms before using. \n- Be more clear on the contributions, contrast with relevant literature, and the specific benefits of the presented method.\n- Fix typos, formatting mistakes etc., as they can be distracting for reading. \n\nThe approach of reverse engineering the hierarchy, and learning high-level transition matrix is very interesting and promising. Perhaps the method can be used to outperform single network approach by using the model as an input to more specialized hierarchical trainers and learn complex behaviors more optimally then possible with one large network approach. Unfortunately, the paper falls short in the novelty, precision, and clarity.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Spatio-Temporal Abstractions in Reinforcement Learning Through Neural Encoding", "abstract": "Recent progress in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled to tackle bigger and more challenging tasks.
