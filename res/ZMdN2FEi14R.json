", "abstract": "Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing field, which studies methods for learning underlying topological structures present in complex data representations. TDA methods have found recent success in extracting useful geometric structures for a wide range of applications, including protein classification, neuroscience, and time-series analysis. However, in many such applications, one is also interested in sequentially detecting changes in this topological structure. We propose a new method called Persistence Diagram based Change-Point (PD-CP), which tackles this problem by integrating the widely-used persistence diagrams in TDA with recent developments in nonparametric change-point detection. The key novelty in PD-CP is that it leverages the distribution of points on persistence diagrams for online detection of topological changes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PD-CP in an application to solar flare monitoring.", "pdf": "/pdf/b0962ec4d897dbb2ccdf0882288f21c64d3d132d.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|online_highdimensional_changepoint_detection_using_topological_data_analysis", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021online,\ntitle={Online High-Dimensional Change-Point Detection using Topological Data Analysis},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZMdN2FEi14R},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
