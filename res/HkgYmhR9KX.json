Previous work has shown that the tracker can be trained in a simulator via reinforcement learning and deployed in real-world scenarios. However, during training, such a method requires manually specifying the moving path of the target object to be tracked, which cannot ensure the tracker\u2019s generalization on the unseen object moving patterns. To learn a robust tracker for VAT, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial RL method which adopts an Asymmetric Dueling mechanism, referred to as AD-VAT. In AD-VAT, both the tracker and the target are approximated by end-to-end neural networks, and are trained via RL in a dueling/competitive manner: i.e., the tracker intends to lockup the target, while the target tries to escape from the tracker. They are asymmetric in that the target is aware of the tracker, but not vice versa. Specifically, besides its own observation, the target is fed with the tracker\u2019s observation and action, and learns to predict the tracker\u2019s reward as an auxiliary task. We show that such an asymmetric dueling mechanism produces a stronger target, which in turn induces a more robust tracker. To stabilize the training, we also propose a novel partial zero-sum reward for the tracker/target. The experimental results, in both 2D and 3D environments, demonstrate that the proposed method leads to a faster convergence in training and yields more robust tracking behaviors in different testing scenarios.

These two techniques are critical for a successful training, and we hope to see their applications to other domains involving adversary/dueling training.\n\nAs for the comments on \"real-world test and results\", we've taken a qualitative testing on some real-world video clips from VOT dataset [Kristan et al. (2016)]. In this evaluation, we feed the video clips to the tracker and observe the network output actions. In general, the results show that the output action is consistent with the position and scale of the target. For example, when the target moves from the image center to the left until disappearing, the tracker outputs actions ``move forward\", ``move forward-left\", and ``turn left\" sequentially. The testing demonstrates the potential of transferring the tracking ability to real-world. \n\nPlease see Appendix.C in our updated submission and watch the demo video here: https://youtu.be/jv-5HVg_Sf4 "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AD-VAT: An Asymmetric Dueling mechanism for learning Visual Active Tracking", "abstract": "Visual Active Tracking (VAT) aims at following a target object by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given visual observations.

Our feedback goes below.\n\nQ1: \"I think the contributions of this work is incremental compared with [Luo et al (2018)] in which the major difference is the partial zero sum reward structure is used and the observations and actions information from the tracker are incorporated into the target network\"\nA1:  Our method is fundamentally different from Luo et al. (2018), please see our reply to R#1 (the Q2-A2) for detailed explanations. In short, the major difference is that we employ Multi-Agent RL to train both the tracker and the target object, while Luo et al. (2018) only train the tracker with Single-Agent RL (where they pre-define/hand-tune the moving path for the target object). Our method turns out better in the sense that it produces a stronger tracker via the proposed asymmetrical dueling training. \n\nThe Multi-Agent RL training in our VAT task is unstable and slow to converge. To address these issues, we derived the two techniques: the partial zero sum and the asymmetrical target object model.\n\n\nQ2: \"In addition, the explanation about importance of the tracker awareness to the target network seems not sufficient. The ancient Chinese proverb is not a good explanation. It would be better if some theoretical support can be provided for such design.\"\nA2: The tracker awareness mechanism for the target object is \"cheating\". This way, the target object would appear to be \"stronger\" than the tracker as it knows what the tracker knows. Such a treatment accelerates the training by inducing a reasonable curriculum to the tracker and finally helps training a much stronger and more generalizable tracker. Note we cannot apply this trick to the tracker as it cannot cheat when deploying. See also our reply to R#1 (Q3-A3).\n\nAs for the details of the tracker-aware model, it not only uses the observation and action of the tracker as extra input information but also employs an auxiliary task to predict the tracker's immediate reward. The auxiliary task could help the tracker learn a better representation for the adversarial policy to challenge the tracker.\n\n\nQ3: \"For active object tracking in real-world/3D environment, designing the reward function only based on the distance between the expected position and the tracked object position can not well reflect the tracker capacity. The scale changes of the target should also be considered when designing the reward function of the tracker. However, the proposed method does not consider the issue, and the evaluation using the reward function based on the position distance may not be sufficient.\"\nA3: The scale of a target object showing up in the tracker's image observation will be implied by the distance between tracker and object, which we've considered when designing the reward function. \n\nConsider a simple case of projecting a line in 3D space onto a camera plane. The length (l) of the line on the 2D image plane is derived by an equation as below:\n                                                                                      l = L*f/d, \nwhere L is the original length in 3D space, f is the distance between the 2D plane and the focal center, and d is the distance between the line and the focal center.\nIn the VAT problem\uff0cf depends on the intrinsic parameters of the camera model, which is fixed; L depends on the 3D model of the target object, which also could be regarded as constant. Thus, the scale of the object in the 2D image plane is impacted only by d, the distance between the target and the tracker. It is not difficult to derive that, the farther the distance d is, the smaller the target is observed. This suggests that the designed distance-based reward function has well considered the scale of the object.\n\nNote that calculating the scale of the target in an image is of high computational complexity. It requires to extract the object mask and calculate the area of the mask. In contrast, our distance-based reward is computationally cheap, thanks to the simulator's APIs by which we can easily access the tracker's and target's world coordinate in the bird view map."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AD-VAT: An Asymmetric Dueling mechanism for learning Visual Active Tracking", "abstract": "Visual Active Tracking (VAT) aims at following a target object by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given visual observations.

", "comment": "Thanks for the review. Our feedback goes below.\n\nQ1: \"Contrived task\"\nA1: Visual object tracking is widely recognized as an important task in Computer Vision. In this study, we propose a principled approach of how to train a robust tracker.\n\n\nQ2: \"The work is very incremental over Luo et al. (2018) \"End-to-end Active Object Tracking and Its Real-world Deployment via Reinforcement Learning\", as the only two additions are extra observations o_t^{alpha} for the target, and a reward function that has a fudge factor when the target gets too far away\"\nA2: Our method is fundamentally different from Luo et al. (2018), as explained below.\n\nLuo et al. (2018) adopted pre-defined target object moving path, coded in hand-tuned scripts. Thus, only the tracker is trainable, and the settings are single-agent RL. \n\nIn our method, the target object is also implemented by a neural network, learning how to escape the tracker during training. Both the tracker and the target object are trained jointly in an adversary/dueling way, and the settings are multi-agent RL. \n\nWe show the advantage of our method over Luo et al. (2018). Note that the pre-defined target object moving path in Luo et al. (2018) can hurt the generalizability of the tracker. In reality, the target object can move in various hard patterns: Z-turn, U-turn, sudden stop, walk-towards-wall-then-turn, etc., which can pose non-trivial difficulties to the tracker during both training and deployment. Moreover, such moving patterns are difficult to be thoroughly covered and coded by the hand-tuning scripts as in Luo et al. (2018).\n\nThe trainable target object in our method, however, can learn the proper moving path in order to escape from the tracker solely by the adversary/dueling training, without hand-tuned path. The smart target object, in turn, induces a tracker that well follows the target no matter how wild the target object moves. Eventually, we obtain a much stronger tracker than that of Luo et al. (2018), achieving the very purpose of our study: to train a robust tracker for VAT task.\n\n\nQ3: \"Should not the asymmetrical relationship work the other way round, with the tracker knowing more about the target?\"\nA3: We should not do that. \n\nNote that the additional \"asymmetrical\" information is way of \"cheating\". As our goal is to train a tracker, we don't need to consider deploying a target object. Therefore, we can simply let the target object cheat during training by feeding to it the tracker's observation/reward/action. Such a \"peeking\" treatment accelerates the training and ultimately improves the tracker's training quality, as is shown in the submitted paper.\n\nThe tracker, however, is unable to \"cheat\" when deployed (e.g., in a real-world robot). It has to predict the action using its own observations. There is no way for the tracker to acquire the information (observation/reward/action) from a target object. \n\n\nQ4: \"The paper would have benefitted from a proper analysis of the trajectories taken by the adversarial target as opposed to the heuristic ones, ...\"\nA4: We have added to Appendix some texts for the analysis, see Appendix.B in the updated submission. The target object does show intriguing behaviors when escaping the tracker, see the supplementary videos available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9rZj4Mea7wOZkdajK1TsprRg8iUf51BS\n\n\nQ5: \"...and from comparison with non-RL state-of-the-art on tracking tasks.\"\nA5: Luo et al. (2018) had done the comparisons and shown their method improves over several representative non-RL trackers in the literature.\nOur method outperforms that of Luo et al. (2018).\n\n\nQ6: \"Citing Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" (please use the correct citation format)...\"\nA6: We have fixed this in the updated submission.\n\n\nQ7: \"Further multi-agent tasks could also have been considered, such as capture the flag tasks as in \"Human-level performance in first-person multiplayer games with population-based deep reinforcement learning\"\"\nA7: The method developed in that paper is for playing the First Person Shooting game, where it has to ensure the fairness among the intra- and inter-team players. In our study, the primary goal is to train a tracker (player 1), permitting us to leverage the asymmetrical mechanism for the target object (player 2). This technique effectively improves the adversary/dueling training and eventually produces a strong tracker."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AD-VAT: An Asymmetric Dueling mechanism for learning Visual Active Tracking", "abstract": "Visual Active Tracking (VAT) aims at following a target object by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given visual observations.

The tracker receives, from its own perspective, partially observed visual information o_t^{alpha} about the target (e.g., an image that may show the target) and the target receives both observations from its own perspective o_t^{beta} and a copy of the information from the tracker's perspective. Both agents are standard convnet + LSTM neural architectures trained using A3C and are evaluated in 2D and 3D environments. The reward function is not completely zero-sum, as the tracked agent's reward vanishes when it gets too far from a reference point in the maze.\n\nThe work is very incremental over Luo et al (2018) \"End-to-end Active Object Tracking and Its Real-world Deployment via Reinforcement Learning\", as the only two additions are extra observations o_t^{alpha} for the target, and a reward function that has a fudge factor when the target gets too far away. Citing Sun Tzu's \"Art of War\" (please use the correct citation format) is not convincing enough for adding the tracker's observations as inputs for the target agent. Should not the asymmetrical relationship work the other way round, with the tracker knowing more about the target?\n\nExperiments are conducted using two baselines for the target agent, one a random walk and another an agent that navigates to a target according to a shortest path planning algorithm. The ablation study shows that the tracker-aware observations and a target's reward structure that penalizes when it gets too far do help the tracker's performance, and that training the target agent helps the tracker agent achieve higher scores. The improvement is however quite small and the task is ad-hoc.\n \nThe paper would have benefitted from a proper analysis of the trajectories taken by the adversarial target as opposed to the heuristic ones, and from comparison with non-RL state-of-the-art on tracking tasks. Further multi-agent tasks could also have been considered, such as capture the flag tasks as in \"Human-level performance in first-person multiplayer games with population-based deep reinforcement learning\".", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1378/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AD-VAT: An Asymmetric Dueling mechanism for learning Visual Active Tracking", "abstract": "Visual Active Tracking (VAT) aims at following a target object by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given visual observations. Previous work has shown that the tracker can be trained in a simulator via reinforcement learning and deployed in real-world scenarios.

To learn a robust tracker for VAT, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial RL method which adopts an Asymmetric Dueling mechanism, referred to as AD-VAT. In AD-VAT, both the tracker and the target are approximated by end-to-end neural networks, and are trained via RL in a dueling/competitive manner: i.e., the tracker intends to lockup the target, while the target tries to escape from the tracker. They are asymmetric in that the target is aware of the tracker, but not vice versa. Specifically, besides its own observation, the target is fed with the tracker\u2019s observation and action, and learns to predict the tracker\u2019s reward as an auxiliary task. We show that such an asymmetric dueling mechanism produces a stronger target, which in turn induces a more robust tracker. To stabilize the training, we also propose a novel partial zero-sum reward for the tracker/target.
