Representation learning on graphs, which are just 1-d simplicial complexes, has witnessed a great attention and success recently. Due to the additional complexity higher dimensional simplicial hold, there has not been enough effort to extend representation learning to these objects especially when it comes to entire-simplicial complex representation learning. In this work, we propose a method for simplicial  complex-level representation learning that embeds a simplicial complex to a universal embedding space in a way that complex-to-complex proximity is preserved. Our method utilizes a simplex-level embedding induced by a pre-trained simplicial autoencoder to learn an entire simplicial complex representation. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first method for learning simplicial complex-level representation.", "pdf": "/pdf/115ece3cd5af786b01381f8176371761d563152d.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|simplicial_complex_representation_learning", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021simplicial,\ntitle={Simplicial Complex Representation Learning},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=q0cC3HzCb7s},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
