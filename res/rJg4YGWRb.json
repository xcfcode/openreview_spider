The similarity function used for the attention (cosine) is symmetric, this means that if two nodes are connected in both directions, they will be equally important for each other. But intuitively this is not true in general. It would be interesting if the authors could elaborate a bit more on the choice of the similarity function.\n\n\n----------\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\nPage 2. I do not understand the point of so many details on Graph Laplacian Regularization.\nPage 2. The use of the term 'skip-grams' is somewhat odd, it is not clear what the authors mean with that.\nPage 3. 'the natural random walk' ???\nBottom of page 4.

The Algorithm is inspired from Graph Neural Networks and more precisely graph convolutional NNs recently proposed by ref (Kipf et al  2016)) in the paper.  These NNs alternate 2 types of layers:  non linear projection and diffusion, the latter incorporates the graph relational information by constraining neighbor nodes to have close representations according to some \u201cgraph metrics\u201d. The authors propose a model with simplified projection layers and more sophisticated diffusion ones, incorporating a simple attention mechanism. Experiments are performed on citation textual datasets. Comparisons with published results on the same datasets are presented.\n\nThe paper is clear and develops interesting ideas relevant to semi-supervised graph node classification. One finding is that simple models perform as well as more complex ones in this setting where labeled data is scarce. Another one is the importance of integrating relational information for classifying nodes when it is available. The attention mechanism itself is extremely simple, and learns one parameter per diffusion layers. One parameter weights correlations between node embeddings in a diffusion layer. I understand that you tried more complex attention mechanisms, but the one finally selected is barely an attention mechanism and rather a simple \u201cimportance\u201d weight. This is not a criticism, but this makes the title somewhat misleading. The experiments show that the proposed model is state of the art for graph node classification. The performance is on par with some other recent models according to table 2. The other tests are also interesting, but the comparison could have been extended to other models e.g. GCN.\nYou advocate the role of the diffusion layers, and in the experiments you stack 3 to 4 such layers. It would be interesting to have indications on the compromise performance/ number of diffusion layers and on the evolution of these performances when adding such layers.\nThe bibliography on semi-supervised learning in graphs for classification is light and should be enhanced.\nOverall this is an interesting paper with nice findings. The originality is however relatively limited in a field where many recent papers have been proposed, and the experiments need to be completed.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Attention-based Graph Neural Network for Semi-supervised Learning", "abstract": "Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches.

Confusing notation is corrected: In the revised version $c$ indexes a label.\n\n2. Why GLN works:  For semi-supervised learning, we believe that the primary gain of using graph neural network comes from the \u201cAveraging\u201d effect. Similar to denoising pixels in images, by averaging neighbors features, we get a denoised version of current nodes\u2019 features. This gives significant gain over those estimations without denoising (such as Mulit-Layer Perceptron in Table 2). This, we believe, is why GLN is already achieving the state-of-the-art performance. The focus of this paper is how to get the next remaining gain, which we achieve by proposing asymmetric averaging using \u201cattention\u201d. So far, we did not see any noticeable gain in non-linear activation for semi-supervised learning. However, we believe such non-linearity can be important for other applications, such as graph classification tasks on molecular networks. \n\n3. Attention in GCN: GCN with attention did not give gain over our AGNN architecture, which is somewhat expected as GCN and GLN have comparable performances, within the error margin of each other. Note that from the architecture complexity perspective AGNN is simpler than GCN with attention, meaning that AGNN might have a better chance explaining the data.\n\n4. Symmetric attention: Even though the scaled cosine similarity would be symmetric between two connected nodes $i$ and $j$, the attention value itself can be different due to the fact that softmax computations are calculated on different neighborhoods: $N(i)$ and $N(j)$ respectively.\nBut we agree that attention mechanism has an element of symmetry and this might be alleviated by using more complex attention mechanism. As the reviewer pointed out, we chose the simple attention mechanism here; we tried various attention mechanisms with varying degrees of complexity, and found the simple attention mechanism to give the best performance. Training complex attention is challenging, and we would like to explore more complex ones in our future work.\n\nResponse to detailed comments:\n\n1. Details on Graph Laplacian Regularization: We added details about Laplacian regularization for completeness of discussion of previous work and because Laplacian regularizations closely related to the propagations layers used in almost all Graph Neural Network papers.\n2. \u2018Skip-grams\u2019: We added some clarification on the use of \u2018skip-grams\u2019 in the revised version.\n3. \u2018Natural random walk\u2019 on a graph is random walk where one move from a node to one of its neighbors selected with uniform probability. We have clarified this in the revised version.\n4. Presentation of the Attention-based Graph Neural Network: Thanks for pointing this out.

We settled on this choice after training/testing several attention mechanisms, most of which are more complex than the one we propose. The proposed simple attention mechanism gave the best performance, among those we tried. We believe this is due to the fact that complex attention mechanisms are harder to train as there are more parameters to learn.\n\n2.

However, given the interest in the numerical comparisons, as the reviewer pointed out, in the revised version, we run these experiments  and reported the performance of GCN in the appendix D (as it might give the wrong impression that those results are performed by the authors of GCN, if we put it in the table in the main text).\n\n3.

Regarding the similar variance of results of AGNN and GLN: In Table 2 of the original version we don\u2019t report the variance or standard-deviation of accuracies of the trials, but we report (as mentioned in paragraph 1 on page 3 of original version) standard-error which defined as standard-deviation/square-root(number of trials) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).  That being said, when the training data is fixed (as is the case for Table 2), the variance of GLN is smaller than that of AGNN as predicted by the reviewer, as the only source of randomness is the initialization of the neural network weights. On the other hand, when the training data is chosen randomly (As is the case for Tables 3 and 4), there are two sources of randomness and the variance of GLN and AGNN are harder to predict and compare. We could not predict how different choices of the training data affects the accuracy, and it can happen that GLN has larger variance than AGNN.\n\n2.

We made a small change in the stopping criteria  to take the best model in validation error out of all epochs. We did not see any significant change when we use the same stopping criteria as GCN.

In VAIN, it is assumed that every agent can possibly interact with every other agent in the system. Where as in AGNN we have a known graph in which real world first order interaction between two nodes are represented as edges and attention is computed only for these first order interactions.
