This is an important problem because minority populations often suffer the worst decrease in model accuracy. This paper attempts to solve this problem for supervised learning by introducing an adaptive algorithm version of SGD that attempts to equalize the \u201cbias-variance\u201d trade-off at each iteration. Through experiments they show that their algorithm does indeed result in an improvement in fairness, according to a variety of fairness metrics.\n\n==== Comments \n\nMy main concern with the paper is that the privacy claims of Algorithm 1 are not clearly discussed. From my reading, the authors never state whether it is differentially private or not, and this definitely needs clarification. My understanding is that it is NOT differentially private, since the clipping bound is data dependent (according to equation 5), and essentially released in the clear. It\u2019s difficult to tell because I couldn\u2019t find a description of zeta, the amount of noise being added to maintain privacy. If the claim isn\u2019t that Algorithm 1 is DP, then the privacy guarantee is restricted to the results in Figure 3, that attack algorithms perform similarly well on DPSGD, FairDP, and significantly better on SGD (non-private). This is certainly nice to see, but it makes a direct comparison to prior work (that is DP) difficult, and a little unfair.\n\nThe experiments are well designed and nicely show how FairDP improves fairness. I am not a fairness expert, so I\u2019m not sure how representative the fairness metrics used in Table 2 are, but it does seem like FairDP improves on prior work in this regard. \n\n==== Presentation\n\nThe presentation could use some work. There are many grammatical errors, and occasionally sentences that I couldn\u2019t make sense of (\u201cThe self-adaptive threshold parameters should be utilized to learn the original machine learning privately with the DP mechanism\u201d). Mathematical sections are often hard to follow, e.g. algorithm 1 is not self contained, what are N and zeta? I didn\u2019t understand what Figure 1 was trying to show?\n\nThe first sentence of section 3.1 seems like a bit dismissive, there is certainly more to the DP ML literature than those three techniques.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1528/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1528/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Fair Differential Privacy Can Mitigate the Disparate Impact on Model Accuracy", "authorids": ["~Wenyan_Liu1", "~Xiangfeng_Wang1", "xjlu@cs.ecnu.edu.cn", "jhcheng@stu.ecnu.edu.cn", "~Bo_Jin1", "xlwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn", "~Hongyuan_Zha1"], "authors": ["Wenyan Liu", "Xiangfeng Wang", "Xingjian Lu", "Junhong Cheng", "Bo Jin", "Xiaoling Wang", "Hongyuan Zha"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "The techniques based on the theory of differential privacy (DP) has become a standard building block in the machine learning community.

In each iteration of DP-SGD, instead of using a uniform gradient clipping threshold for all groups, the proposed Fair DP-SGD algorithm uses an optimal clipping threshold (one that minimizes the bias-variance tradeoff) for each group separately. The authors include experimental results to show how well their algorithm performs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\nWhile the problem considered by the authors is very interesting and has impact on real world, I recommend rejection. The major concern I have with this work is that it lacks a formal (differential) privacy statement. I am not even entirely sure that the proposed algorithm is actually differentially private because the step that finds the optimal clipping thresholds seems to use the non-noisy mini-batch gradients without any privatization (please clarify if my understanding is not correct). In any case, if the proposed algorithm is claimed to be (epsilon, delta)-DP then there must be a rigorous proof for it. Also, in the experiments I don't see any reported values for epsilon? Are different methods compared with the same value of epsilon?\n\nOther comments:\n\n-In addition to a formal privacy statement, the authors should formally define the notions of \"privacy\" and \"fairness\" that they use in the paper. Overall, I believe this work can have a better formalization.\n\n-As mentioned earlier, I cannot find the values of epsilon in the experiments. The authors could for e.g. use moments accountant to find the total privacy loss in their experiments.\n\n-When the model is logistic regression (which is the adopted model for 2/3 of the datasets in the experiments) and if the input data is normalized, then the Lipschitz constant L of the (logistic) loss function is a small constant. So in this case clipping the gradients is not necessary because the norm of gradients is always bounded by the Lipschitz constant L which is small and the added noise can be calibrated to L. I think in the case of logistic regression, the authors should also compare their method with a private SGD algorithm that simply adds noise with scale ~ L without any clipping.\n\n-I'm not sure if I understand the optimization problem given in 6a, 6b and how the algorithm is solving it. In particular, the constraint set of the problem seems to be all models with optimal risk (absent any fairness, privacy). But are you actually solving this problem? I.e., does the model output by the algorithm fall into this constraint set?\n\n-The gradients are sometimes denoted by g^t := \\nabla L and other times by \\nabla f (see for e.g. section 2.2).

The proposed approach makes sense at a high level, and seems to succeed in achieving the goal.  \n\nWeak Points:\n\n1. Possible problem with DP-SGD (see below).\n2. Some missing details in the algorithm (see below).\n3. Experiments are somewhat confusing (see below).\n\nOther Notes:\n\nThe weak points listed above are more like questions that could use further clarification.  \n\n1. In Equation (2) you describe DP-SGD as adding scalar noise * vector of ones (same noise value to each entry).  However, this is not how DP-SGD usually works.  Is this a typo or can you clarify why you are adding noise in this way?\nHow are you calculating the total privacy cost (eps, delta) at the end of the algorithm.  Do different groups get different levels of privacy protection, and if so what does that mean, and is that considered a fairness violation as well?\n\n\n2. In related work you describe an approach to fairness that works by simply reweighting the loss function to boost impact of under-represented classes.  Wouldn\u2019t that be a simpler approach than what you are doing but provide the same benefits?  Should potentially be considered as a baseline.  \n\n3. \na) Fig 3 doesn\u2019t really make sense as a line plot to me.  \nb) Also measuring privacy by strength of adversaries does not seem natural here, I would prefer to measure privacy using the parameters eps/delta. \nb) Why is DPSGD doing so poorly on the total loss?  I have to wonder if it is just not well-tuned?  My expectation is that mechanisms that don\u2019t impose fairness requirements would achieve better total loss, although more uneven between the classes.
