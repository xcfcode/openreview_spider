This is a pretty interesting application of a family of f-divergences (the hockey-stick divergences) as well as the necessary theory. It would be interesting to see if adjusting gamma can be used to slowly temper the model towards TV. Also, I have questions about the gamma parameter and optimality / non-optimality (it's unclear how optimal the discriminator was in the experiments), since it seems like GANs do well in the non-optimal case (regularization, early-stopping on the discriminator, etc). Finally, the results are counter-intuitive, no? It's stated that gamma > 1 can measure 0 divergence for P != 0, but it's exactly the gamma > 1 experiment that does best (correct me if I'm wrong).
