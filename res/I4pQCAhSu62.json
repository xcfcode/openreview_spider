It measures the magnitude of the change in the loss of a perfect model that an input feature can incur. They leverage this metric to design a utility-aware perturbation that they use to control the trade-off between model robustness and its sensitivity to high utility features. They formulate the problem as contrastive loss which can be added as a regularizer for advanced training stages. They dubbed this method as Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL). Finally, they defined another metric dubbed contextual feature sensitivity that is loosely defined as the magnitude of the change in the activations of a model that an input feature can incur.\n\n### Strengths\n1. FCL is a simple method that can be added as a fine-tuning step\n1. Clear submission with sound experimental setup and sufficient results on small synthetic and real datasets\n\n### Weaknesses\n1. The impact of this work would greatly benefit from ImageNet experiments as it is the main benchmark for this limited type of robustness\n1. Two metrics were introduced (utility and sensitivity) but only one of them was used in the rest of the work with only a hand-wavy explanation of their relationship (e.g., it would be interesting to see how they interplay when training with and without FCL)\n1. The motivation behind the contextual feature utility metric should make it model-independent but defined as the model's own loss gradient w.r.t. the input (e.g. in practice, it could be defined by a pre-trained model instead and used for training)\n\nCan the authors comment on the negative points mentioned above?\n\n### Rating\nI like the simplicity of the idea and its applicability. However, I gave it this score mainly because of the previous reasons and its potential impact. Since the authors are interested in these simple corruptions, the value of the work is hindered by the absence of ImageNet experiments.\n\n### Verdict\nThank you for addressing all my concerns. This gives me the confidence to slightly increase my score. \n\nOne more small thing, for future work, you might also consider incorporating clipping the metrics to the input range.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning", "authorids": ["~Seungyeon_Kim1", "~Daniel_Glasner2", "~Srikumar_Ramalingam2", "~Cho-Jui_Hsieh1", "papineni@google.com", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Seungyeon Kim", "Daniel Glasner", "Srikumar Ramalingam", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Kishore Papineni", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "non-adversarial robustness", "sensitivity", "input perturbation", "contextual feature utility", "contextual feature sensitivity."], "abstract": "It is generally believed that robust training of extremely large networks is critical to their success in real-world applications.

The authors propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) to regularize models to be more sensitive to features that have higher utility, i.e. change the classification loss of the model to a larger extent. FCL first ranks features according to how much they change the loss values. Gaussian perturbations are then added to the top- and bottom-ranked pixels to form negative and positive pairs with the original input respectively. Contrastive learning is conducted by training the feature extractor of the classifier to minimize distance between the two hidden states in a particular positive pair, in order to align feature sensitivity with utility. The authors create a synthetic MNIST classification task where a subset of digit classes are affected by the presence of other digits at the corner of the image, to test a model\u2019s selective sensitivity to input features. Through experiments on the synthetic MNIST and two variants of CIFAR datasets, FCL is shown to improve classification accuracy under noisy conditions while maintaining good clean accuracy.\n\nPros:\n\n+Good direction to train models that strive to have a better balance between robustness against label-preserving perturbations and sensitivity towards label-changing perturbations.\n\n+The idea of using contrastive learning to improve the robustness of models is interesting and could potentially be used for other kinds of perturbations.\n \n \nCons:\n\n-Lack of studies on robustness against adversarial examples (L-p and invariance types), experiments currently only show results on robustness on gaussian/uniform noise. \n\n-Little theoretical support or justification on why aligning the feature sensitivity and utility proposed here would help balance between sensitivity and robustness (such as against L-p and invariance adversarial examples).\n\nRecommendation:\nWhile the idea of training a model to be both robust and sensitive at the same time is well-motivated and promising, the experiments here fall short of evaluating robustness beyond gaussian/uniform noise. The claims of the paper would be stronger with robustness evaluation against the widely-studied L-p norm and recent invariance adversarial examples that are also mentioned in this paper.\n \nConsidering the lack of the aforementioned experiments and of more rigorous theoretical support for FCL for robustness that generalizes beyond the gaussian/uniform noise evaluated here, this paper is still not ready for publication.\n\nOther questions and comments:\nWhat is the performance of the model if Contrastic Learning is done by creating positive pairs by just adding gaussian noise to the original image? \n\nSince the proposed method, FCL, relies on contrastive learning, it would help to discuss prior work on contrastive learning, especially highly similar ones such as: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07589.pdf\n\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning", "authorids": ["~Seungyeon_Kim1", "~Daniel_Glasner2", "~Srikumar_Ramalingam2", "~Cho-Jui_Hsieh1", "papineni@google.com", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Seungyeon Kim", "Daniel Glasner", "Srikumar Ramalingam", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Kishore Papineni", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "non-adversarial robustness", "sensitivity", "input perturbation", "contextual feature utility", "contextual feature sensitivity."], "abstract": "It is generally believed that robust training of extremely large networks is critical to their success in real-world applications.

We also clarified the contribution of our work in this context (Section 1).\n * **Sensitivity and utility:** We clarified how FCL uses both contextual feature sensitivity and utility and the interplay between them (Section 3). We also added a more detailed discussion of their relationship in (Appendix A).\n * **Loss functions:** We clarified the use of different contrastive loss functions in FCL (Section 3).\n * **New contrastive learning baseline:** Per AnonReviewer2\u2019s request, we added a new baseline \u201cCL+Gaussian\u201d that creates the positive pair by adding Gaussian noise to the original image instead of FCL\u2019s utility-dependent perturbation. We evaluated the new baseline on all (larger-scale) experiments and updated (Table 2, Table 3 and Appendix C) with the results. We also updated the relevant discussions in (Section 4.2).\n * **ImageNet-C:** Addressing AnonReviewer4\u2019s request, we added an experiment evaluating all methods on ImageNet-C [Hendrycks et al., 2019]. The results are reported in (Table 3 and Appendix C). We updated discussion of the results in (Section 4.2) and experiment details in (Section 4.2 and Appendix B).\n\nThank you for your time, and we hope that the changes address all of your concerns.\n\n[Hendrycks et al., 2019] Hendrycks, Dan, and Thomas Dietterich. \"Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261 (2019)]\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning", "authorids": ["~Seungyeon_Kim1", "~Daniel_Glasner2", "~Srikumar_Ramalingam2", "~Cho-Jui_Hsieh1", "papineni@google.com", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Seungyeon Kim", "Daniel Glasner", "Srikumar Ramalingam", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Kishore Papineni", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "non-adversarial robustness", "sensitivity", "input perturbation", "contextual feature utility", "contextual feature sensitivity."], "abstract": "It is generally believed that robust training of extremely large networks is critical to their success in real-world applications.

In this paper our focus is on the latter. In fact, our goal of \u201cmaking models sensitive to important features\u201d implies that the model should not be adversarially robust on high utility features.\n\nAdversarial robustness aims to protect from adversarially-generated small magnitude perturbations, whereas robustness to natural perturbations addresses large magnitude perturbations drawn from specific \u201cnatural\u201d distributions such as sensor corruptions or blur. To validate that our method improves robustness to natural perturbations, we conduct experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with synthetic noise injection and 19 corrupted patterns introduced in [Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019], which is a standard benchmark for evaluating robustness to natural perturbations. \n\nRecent papers [Laugros et al., 2019, Gulshad et al., 2020] discuss the relationship between adversarial robustness and natural perturbation robustness, and find that they are usually poorly correlated. For example, Table 5 in [Laugros et al., 2019] shows models trained for adversarial robustness that are not more robust than standard models on common perturbation benchmarks. The converse is also shown (Section 4.2 in [Laugros et al., 2019]). [Gulshad et al., 2020] also found a similar trend.  \n\nWhile both are important goals, we highlight some key differences between these tasks. \n* The average perturbation magnitude in the datasets used in our experiments is much larger than the perturbation radii typically used in the adversarial robustness setting. For example the authors of [Yang et al. 2020] cite 0.031 as a typical perturbation radius for CIFAR-10 in the adversarial robustness literature. We measured the average perturbation magnitudes in CIFAR-10-C, and find that they are larger by an order of magnitude. CIFAR-10-C includes 5 levels of severity, the average $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm over all perturbations in the lowest severity level is 0.259, and 0.453 for the highest. \n* Adversarial robustness usually comes at the cost of significant negative impact on the clean accuracy [Zhang et al., 2019, Mandry et al., 2017]; however, FCL does not hurt the clean accuracy.\n\nRegarding [Kim et al., 2020]: We thank the reviewer for pointing out this highly relevant paper! We will be happy to add a discussion of this paper in ours. [Kim et al., 2020] and ours differ in three main aspects. a) Their paper focuses on adversarial robustness while ours focuses on robustness to natural perturbations. b) Since their paper focuses on the adversarial robustness, their contrastive learning effectively suppresses the distance between the original and an adversarially perturbed image (against random pairs). In contrast, we apply contrastive learning to low- and high-utility perturbation pairs, encouraging the former to be close and the latter to be far. c) [Kim et al., 2020]\u2019s perturbation is based on an unsupervised loss (instance identification task), while ours rely on class labels to identify feature dimensions that are useful/not useful for the main classification task.\n\nRegarding contrastive learning with Gaussian noise: We will run the experiment and update as soon as we have results. We expect this new baseline to behave similarly to our \u201cGaussian\u201d baseline in Section 4.2. Both methods encourage the original image and a version with added Gaussian noise to be close in the embedding space.\n\nReferences:\n* [Gulshad et al., 2020] Gulshad, Sadaf, Jan Hendrik Metzen, and Arnold Smeulders. \"Adversarial and Natural Perturbations for General Robustness.\" arXiv e-prints (2020): arXiv-2010.\n* [Kim et al., 2020] Kim, Minseon, Jihoon Tack, and Sung Ju Hwang. \"Adversarial self-supervised contrastive learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020).\n* [Laugros et al., 2019] Laugros, Alfred, Alice Caplier, and Matthieu Ospici. \"Are Adversarial Robustness and Common Perturbation Robustness Independent Attributes?.\" Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops. 2019.\n* [Mandry et al., 2017] Madry, Aleksander, et al. \"Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.06083.\n* [Yang et al., 2020] Yang, Yao-Yuan, et al. \"A closer look at accuracy vs. robustness.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020).\n* [Zhang et al., 2019] Zhang, Hongyang, et al. \"Theoretically principled trade-off between robustness and accuracy.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.08573 (2019).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning", "authorids": ["~Seungyeon_Kim1", "~Daniel_Glasner2", "~Srikumar_Ramalingam2", "~Cho-Jui_Hsieh1", "papineni@google.com", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Seungyeon Kim", "Daniel Glasner", "Srikumar Ramalingam", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Kishore Papineni", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "non-adversarial robustness", "sensitivity", "input perturbation", "contextual feature utility", "contextual feature sensitivity."], "abstract": "It is generally believed that robust training of extremely large networks is critical to their success in real-world applications.

In particular, FCL_margin explicitly encourages embeddings of low-utility perturbations to be as close as possible to the original version, and those corresponding to high utility perturbations to be separated by at least a margin. FCL_XE on the other hand, is applied to all pairs in the batch and imposes ranking constraints rather than an explicit separation by a margin. \n\nEmpirically, we tried both loss functions in the MNIST experiments and found that they achieve  similar performance.

We are running experiments, and we will update as soon as we have the results.\n* Regarding \u201ctwo metrics\u201d: thank you for drawing our attention to a part of the text which might be confusing, we will revise the paper to clarify. \n\n  Our feature contrastive learning uses both contextual utility and contextual sensitivity simultaneously. The utility is used for selecting the features, and the associated sensitivity values are adjusted by applying the contrastive loss. In particular, the utility identifies the features we want to perturb, and our loss function tries to increase or decrease the sensitivity of the model to those features, based on their utility values. \n\n  To provide further intuition for the connection between utility and sensitivity, consider a classification task with cross entropy loss, and let $f()$ be the output of the network after applying a softmax. In this setting, the loss is minus log probability of the correct label.\n\n  The utility of $f()$ is defined by \n  $$\nu = \\left| \\frac{ \\partial \\ell(y, f(x; w)) } { \\partial x}  \\right| = \\left| \\frac{ \\partial \\log[ f(x; w)_{y} ] } { \\partial x } \\right| = \\frac{1}{ {f(x; w)}_y }  \\left| \\frac{\\partial {f(x; w)}_y } { \\partial x }  \\right|\n $$\n  Also recall that the sensitivity of $f()$ is given by\n  $$\ns = \\left| \\left| \\frac{\\partial f(x; w)}{\\partial x} \\right| \\right|  = \\sqrt{\\sum_c \\frac{\\partial f(x; w)_c^2}{\\partial x}}.\n  $$\n  We can see that the utility is a product of two terms. The first is the reciprocal of the networks\u2019 prediction for the correct class, and the second is the sensitivity term specific to the correct class. When the network\u2019s prediction is correct the utility is proportional to the ground truth class\u2019s sensitivity. If changing the feature will not affect the correct prediction it doesn\u2019t have much utility and vice versa. On the other hand, when the network makes a mistake, the utility will be large regardless of the ground truth class\u2019s sensitivity. Our algorithm takes advantage of this behavior to promote robustness and maintain sensitivity.\n* Thanks for suggesting that we can use a \u201ca pre-trained model\u201d for the utility function. This is an excellent idea! Indeed, FCL can be applied with an \u201coracle utility\u201d or a \u201cteacher utility\u201d (as in distillation) providing the model with guidance on contextual utility. For example we could consider a human, or a more powerful pre-trained model. We hope to explore this idea in future work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning", "authorids": ["~Seungyeon_Kim1", "~Daniel_Glasner2", "~Srikumar_Ramalingam2", "~Cho-Jui_Hsieh1", "papineni@google.com", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Seungyeon Kim", "Daniel Glasner", "Srikumar Ramalingam", "Cho-Jui Hsieh", "Kishore Papineni", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "non-adversarial robustness", "sensitivity", "input perturbation", "contextual feature utility", "contextual feature sensitivity."], "abstract": "It is generally believed that robust training of extremely large networks is critical to their success in real-world applications.

Yes, robustness and sensitivity are overloaded terms and used in many different contexts. To clarify, we use the term \u201crobustness\u201d as the generic notion of model stability -- how resilient the model prediction would be when we change the input. The sensitivity is simply the opposite meaning in this context -- how much a sensitive model changes their prediction when we change the input. We view adversarial robustness and robustness to so-called common or natural perturbations as two different goals. In this paper our focus is on the latter. (Please see our response titled \u201cAdversarial robustness vs. natural perturbation robustness\u201d for additional details.) \n* We completely agree. There are not many papers on this topic. We believe that this is an important problem and that both robustness and sensitivity should be targeted in model training. While robustness (especially the adversarial case) has received much attention, the importance of balancing these measures has received very little attention. A few recent papers [Tsipras et al., 2018, Schmidt et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2019, Tram\u00e8r et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020] have started emphasizing the importance of this problem, but do not provide a solution.

However, when taken to the extreme, methods that promote robustness can hurt the model\u2019s sensitivity to rare or underrepresented patterns. In this paper, we discuss this trade-off between robustness and sensitivity by introducing two notions: contextual feature utility and contextual feature sensitivity. We propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) that encourages the model to be more sensitive to the features that have higher contextual utility. Empirical results demonstrate that models trained with FCL achieve a better balance of robustness and sensitivity, leading to improved generalization in the presence of noise.", "one-sentence_summary": "Taken to the extreme, robustness can hurt sensitivity, we propose a balance by contrasting feature perturbations with high and low contextual utility.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "kim|balancing_robustness_and_sensitivity_using_feature_contrastive_learning", "pdf": "/pdf/1c3f624e56375d32298d8085dcac9fbc6e890b1c.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=VuEWKHtnnr", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkim2021balancing,\ntitle={Balancing Robustness and Sensitivity using Feature Contrastive Learning},\nauthor={Seungyeon Kim and Daniel Glasner and Srikumar Ramalingam and Cho-Jui Hsieh and Kishore Papineni and Sanjiv Kumar},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=I4pQCAhSu62}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
