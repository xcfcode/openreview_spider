In order to improve this paper, I would suggest the authors do the following: \n\n1) Heavily edit and rewrite the paper focusing on clarity of communication.\n2) Provide justifications for why design choices were made. For example, the authors state that they include a charge and energy matrix to \"mix all the things up.\" Why does it make sense to combine these factors in this way? \n3) Provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model, showing improved performance across more than one target and including appropriate baselines, including [1]. \n\n[1] Gilmer, Justin, et al. \"Neural message passing for quantum chemistry.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.01212 (2017).", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper372/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Pixel Chem: A Representation for Predicting Material Properties with Neural Network", "abstract": "In this work we developed a new representation of the chemical information for the machine learning models, with benefits from both the real space (R-space) and energy space (K-space).

The authors claim that the use of prior chemical knowledge such as Mulliken electronegativity, bond strength and orbital information improves prediction accuracy. While the idea of incorporating chemical domain knowledge in the interactions of an atomistic neural network is interesting in principle, this paper has severe issues ranging from presentation over the proposed approach to the results.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to point out that the results in Table 1 are cherry-picked since the authors fail to cite neural network architectures that outperform their approach, e.g. for U0: 0.45 kcal/mol [MPNN, Gilmer et al 2017, ICML], 0.31 kcal/mol [SchNet, Sch\u00fctt et al, NIPS 30, 2017], 0.26 kcal/mol [HIP-NN, Lubbers et al., JCP 148, 2018]. This is especially apparent since Figure 4 is obviously inspired by Fig. 1 in [SchNet, Sch\u00fctt et al, JCP 148, 2018]. \n\nThe authors use a variety of heuristics and approximations such as a \"charge transfer ability\", bond strength, exponential decay of distances and overlaps of atomic orbitals which are multiplied \"to mix all things up\", to arrive at the PixelChem representation which is then fed into an atomistic neural network (PCnet). Combining these chemical features in such a way is neither well-motivated, nor does it lead to an improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art networks.\nEven for the intensive properties (gap, HOMO, LUMO), where PCnet is supposed to have an advantage due to its use of orbital information, MPNN, SchNet and even GC and GG-NN in Table 1 outperform the proposed approach. Parameterization of the chemical features and training the PCnet end-to-end might have improved results and seems like a missed opportunity.\n\nFurther issues:\n- The manuscript is riddled with typos, grammatical errors as well as confusing sentences.\n- The authors claim that PCnet is applicable to periodic structures, however, this is never demonstrated. Beyond that their definition of periodic PixelChem does only include adjacent cells, while for a unique representation more cells might be required.\n- The \"benefits\" listed in Section 2.3 compare selectively to previous work. E.g., invariances, uniqueness, asymmetric interactions are also fullfiled by the neural networks listed above. A comparison of the PixelChem representation to the Coulomb matrix is not sufficient here.\n- The PCnet architecture uses PReLU nonlinearities. While this is fine for equilibrium predictions, for other configurations this prohibits the prediction of a smooth PES.\n\nOverall, I believe that it is important to incorporate chemical knowledge into neural networks. However, neither the approach nor the results convince me that this has been achieved here.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper372/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Pixel Chem: A Representation for Predicting Material Properties with Neural Network", "abstract": "In this work we developed a new representation of the chemical information for the machine learning models, with benefits from both the real space (R-space) and energy space (K-space).

Actually, we found that considering cohesive energy is not the best way to delete inappropriate data from QM9.  It is more reasonable to delete the structures with spin. The spin comes from some single electrons, which means those nucleus does not satisfy the 8 outer electrons rule and will result in a property of instability. According to the path we creating matrices, theoretically, the PCnet can have better adaption to structures after deleting data with spin and actually we have an improvement of about 2% in prediction accuracy compared to the method in the current version. We will update the related content during the rebuttal period, and you can keep track of our newest version.
