Based on the arguments made in the paper, this should work fine. Why wasn't it tested? If it doesn't work, are the arguments incorrect or incomplete?\n\nWe have gathered results for the original design in order to compare it with the other 3 in the first experiment (Plain, Residual and Gated Residual). Interestingly, it seems that this design is even better when dealing with increased depth (the 100-layered setting, for example). We would like to thank you for the suggestion, since such valuable results could have been gone unnoticed otherwise.\n\n- For the MNIST experiments, since the hyperparameters are fixed, the plots are misleading if any dependence on hyperparameters exists for the different models. This experiment appears to be based on Srivastava et al (2015). If it is indeed designed to test optimization at aggressive depths, then apart from doing a hyperparameter search, the authors should not use regularization such as dropout or batch norm, which do not appear in the theoretical arguments for the architecture.\n\nWe are currently running a new batch of experiments with 200+ layered networks.

In case we used a data-dependent scalar to control the gates, we would need a Nx1 matrix (considering a fully-connected network) to achieve this. This would imply in N times more parameters than our approach.\n    + This would make the analysis extremely more complex. It would not be possible to understand as easily the exact effects of the extra dimension that each k parameter adds to the cost surface. I believe it would be actually impossible with the current theoretical tools we have, since the problem would be as hard as understanding how a new layer affects the cost function. This would result in understanding the whole cost function of a Deep Network, since it it is decomposable in a limited number of layers. Having a single data-independent scalar and a linear gate offers the huge advantage of understanding very easily its impact on the model.\n    + One of our proposals is to use the method as a way for layers to fully deactivate. This is only feasible if the parameters that deactivate the layer are data-independent, because if they were data-dependent we would have the constraint: \\forall x, u(x) = x. That is, the gates would have to deactivate for every possible input. Since the number of parameters of a data-dependent layer is lower bounded by N, we would require at least N parameters to be set to zero. This would offer little advantage compared to how Residual layers behave as identity mappings for specific parameter sets. In our approach, layers truly become identity mappings, instead of just having the ability to behave as such mapping for specific data points.\n\n\n- Did the authors try their original design of u = g(k)f(x) + (1 - g(k))x where f(x) is a plain layer instead of a residual layer? Based on the arguments made in the paper, this should work fine. Why wasn't it tested? If it doesn't work, are the arguments incorrect or incomplete?\n\nSuch layers have already been partially explored in \"Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks\", and perform similarly to Residual Networks. Unfortunately following the ~8 page limit was not possible with all discussions and experiments we had in mind.\n\nEDIT: We have realized that adding such results without having over 10 pages was doable. Therefore we will add them to the conference version in case of acceptance.\n\n\n- For the MNIST experiments, since the hyperparameters are fixed, the plots are misleading if any dependence on hyperparameters exists for the different models. This experiment appears to be based on Srivastava et al (2015). If it is indeed designed to test optimization at aggressive depths, then apart from doing a hyperparameter search, the authors should not use regularization such as dropout or batch norm, which do not appear in the theoretical arguments for the architecture.\n\nWe have not used Dropout for such experiments. We believe that the internal covariate shift is an orthogonal problem to the one of learning identity mappings -- even though they both negatively impact the optimization of deep networks --, therefore we decided on using BN for all our tests.\n\n\n- Some questions regarding g(): Was g() always ReLU? Doesn't this have potential problems with g(k) becoming 0 and never recovering? Does this also mean that for the wide resnet in Fig 7, most residual blocks are zeroed out since k < 0?\n\nDuring prototyping we have tested sigmoid, linear and ReLU. Sigmoid had three major disadvantages: first, if just performed worse, second, we lost the linear interpretation of the extra dimension (where the slices of the new dimension are linear combinations of the original model and the identity mapping, roughly speaking), lastly, g(k) could not be >1, which means the gate could not properly suppress the shortcut connection (as the network does in the last layer for both experiments we ran).\nLinear and ReLU perform the same, except for when layers deactivate. We chose to use ReLU exactly for its deactivation: we propose our method as one whose layers can be fully pruned during training, hence making future epochs faster. Using the ReLU as g(k) is equivalent to using a linear gate where layers are removed from the model once k < 0. Of course, nothing stops a linear function to be used as g. As for Fig 7, thanks a lot for pointing the mistake, the values in the graph are actually the real values minus 1.

If it is indeed designed to test optimization at aggressive depths, then apart from doing a hyperparameter search, the authors should not use regularization such as dropout or batch norm, which do not appear in the theoretical arguments for the architecture.\n\nFor CIFAR experiments, the obtained improvements compared to the baseline (wide resnets) are very small and therefore it is important to report the standard deviations (or all results) in both cases. It's not clear that the differences are significant.\n\nSome questions regarding g(): Was g() always ReLU? Doesn't this have potential problems with g(k) becoming 0 and never recovering? Does this also mean that for the wide resnet in Fig 7, most residual blocks are zeroed out since k < 0?", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Identity Mappings with Residual Gates", "abstract": "We propose a layer augmentation technique that adds shortcut connections with a linear gating mechanism, and can be applied to almost any network model.

Can you elaborate more on this? Why should this be the case? \n\nActually, the SDI is just a lower bound to the path's length, since it ignores how the parameters are updated. It is equivalent to assuming that the optimizer always makes \"perfect\" updates (that is, in the correct direction), thus following the shortest path between the current parameter state and the \"optimal\" one. I will work on making this explanation better for the next version.\n\n\n\n\n- Why do you substitute mean and variance with initialization mean variance in derivation in Eq 15 and 16?\n\nThose are the mean and variances of each parameter in the considered tensor/matrix. My intent is to analyze how easily a network can learn identity mappings, therefore I consider the initial state of the network, which is when parameters are initialized. For example, if I were to initialize all layers' parameters with values which correspond to identity mappings -- for example, the identity matrix or the dirac tensor for plain fully-connected or conv networks -- then the network would require zero updates to learn the identity, which would immediately be observed with a SDI of zero. This can be observed with recurrent nets' behaviors when initializing the transition matrix as the identity.\n\n\n\n\n- Why there is no Highway Neural Networks result in Table 5? \n\nThanks for pointing that out, I will add them to the next version.\n\n\n\n\n- In Table 5, why does  He et al.

I do not believe it is fair to use best-out-of-5 results for comparison, especially since, as long as I'm aware, it would be the only result in that table to be best-out-of-x instead of mean/median/single-run. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n\n\n\n- Regarding \"Our results don\u2019t surpass the state-of-the-art, which was expected considering the hardware limitations. However, taking into account the improvement observed when augmenting a smaller Wide ResNet, we believe that the technique proposed can be used to surpass the state-of-the-art\", you may use that result for sanity check during the empirical work but how can you claim that you will get any improvement over baselines in final comparison? \n\nI agree that there is little experimental evidence to support such claim, considering the vast amount of techniques in the literature that work well for small experiments but fail on larger ones. The intuition for such claim was that, since the k values are initialized as 1.0 (a detail which I forgot to add to the paper, as I was informed), then doing no optimization on such parameters is equivalent to a vanilla residual block, which is what achieves the SOTA. Given the non-convex nature of the optimization, however, there are no strong guarantees that the optimizer might end up optimizing the parameters in a \"bad way\", performance-wise. We have managed to run more complex networks (~37M parameters) and achieve around 3.71% error in preliminary tests -- such results will be added to the next version of the paper.\n\n\n\n- Baselines have Imagenet results. In order to obtain satisfactory comparison, you would need that too. Are there any results on Imagenet comparison?\n\nUnfortunately, not so far.

I have plans to add a more formal explanation (possibly in the appendix due to the paper already being longer than suggested).\n\nRegarding the random pruning, the k's have extremely low variance after the network is trained. Therefore there is little difference between a \"high\" and a \"low\" k. However, the setting is different with Residual Networks: the k values of blocks where there is no dimension increase (that is, no convolution in the shortcut connection) are extremely uniform among themselves, as are the k values of blocks with dimension increase. However, the two groups have a very different mean (around 0.8 for the first group vs 1.5 in the second).
