Algorithm 1 is not well-written and it is hard to follow.\n\nAnswer 1: We sincerely appreciate this instructive review. We firstly re-write the Algorithm 1 and its description. We also take the updated figure 4a  and more detailed figure 6 as an example to better illustrate our Algorithm 1.  These updates can be seen in the revised submission now.  Here we introduce the context, motivation, function, and effect of our Algorithm 1.\n\nThe context of our Algorithm 1(BTBPT) is that we model the channel-wise activation approximation as a hyper-parameters ($\\alpha_t$ and $\\beta_t$) search problem. However, the search space is too enormous so that Deep-Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Polulation Based Training (PBT) suffer from slow learning speed and inadequate search performance.  To tackle this problem, we propose Algorithm 1 to better search the hyper-parameters. The Algorithm 1 takes the $T$-layer neural network $M_T$, training data $D$ and accuracy threshold $A_t$ as inputs, and outputs all the the $\\alpha_t$ and $\\beta_t$ with updated weights $W$, accuracy $A$ and score $S$.  Figure 4(a) shows a comparison of PBT and BTPBT for a $T$-layer network ($T=4$). Figure 4(b) depicts the learning curves of PTB, DRL, and our SAFENet, which are used to search hyper-parameters $\\alpha_t$ and $\\beta_t$ for the same score. After 200 training epochs, BTPBT is able to replace $ 80$ % neurons, but PBT and DRL only replace $<30$% neurons. \n\n\n##### Question 2. Citation in the section 2. More citation about HE and MPC.\nAnswer 2: We really appreciate reviewer 2 for the thoughtful comments towards improving our manuscript. We have fixed them in the revised manuscript.\n\n##### Question 3. More related work discussion on InstaHide[1] and TextHide[2].\n\nAnswer 3: We thank the reviewer for pointing these related works. We have added them into the related works in the revised manuscripts.  InstaHide[1] and TextHide[2] use a class of subset-sum type encryption[3] to protect the user's sensitive data in machine learning service with only $<5$% computational overhead and little accuracy loss. However, an attack[4] shows that there is a potential security risk on the InstaHide. The light-weight InstaHide and TextHide have advantages on performance (especially the latency), but Yao\u2019s Gabled Circuits[5] and HE[6] are of advantages in the security guarantees so far.\n\n[1] Huang, Yangsibo, Zhao, Song, Kai, Li, and Sanjeev, Arora. \"TextHide: Tackling Data Privacy in Language Understanding Tasks.\" .

The authors show that this doesn't result in decrease in accuracy but leads to speedup in performance.\n\nI think it is a neat trick to exploit the high-dimensional intermediate feature space given that the network only uses a low dimensional subspace of it. It is an interesting use of the idea which has been demonstrated in prior works - low dimensionality of the feature space or that the learning task can be done by randomly switching of a huge fraction of available channels.\n\nHowever, I think the paper has two main issues which prevents me from providing a more favourable decision.\n\n\n* Novelty and Comparison\n   * The key novelty of this paper is to figure out which channels can be approximated with polynomials and which needs to be retained in its original capacity. This approximation leads to a speedup. While it is a neat modification, I think it is very incremental in its novelty and the performance is not very large either.  The time for one ResNet32 inference on CIFAR100 with SafeNet is 0.62x of Delphi, which is not a very large improvement.\n   * It would also be helpful to compare with techniques other than gazelle and Delphi that modifies the neural networks prior to training (eg. binarizing the network, ternarizing the network, fixed point precision etc) so that the accuracy-latency of the trade-off can be put into perspective and compared easily.  When considering methods to speedup Encrypted Prediction as a Service, one should naturally talk about fixed precision networks and binary neural networks (BNNs). In the past, BNNs have shown remarkable speedups in computation without a major hit to accuracy (Sanyal et. al. 2018), which is in fact a major point of this paper. Similarly, the paper should also discuss and compare with techniques that uses modification of encryption schemes specifically meant to optimize activations in NNs (eg. Lou et. al. 2019)\n\nThere has been a large body of work in the past few works that claim to improve latency of encrypted prediction. It is getting hard to say whether a technique really provides a speedup unless a more comprehensive experimental survey is done with a series of papers using benchmark datasets and networks. i would encourage the authors to have more techniques in their experimental comparison section.\n\n* Clarity -  I have found the paper very hard to read in general and some major gaps when considering baselines and background discussion.\n    * I think the paper would be much easier to read if the citations were modified with something akin to \\citep and \\citet. \n    *  The figures (Fig 1, Fig 3, Fig 4) are very far from being self-contained. I think it is okay to omit some details from the figures But there should be proper explanations in the captions. It is very hard to understand to understand what the notations mean in Fig 1A and what 0L, 4L, and the percentages mean. Similarly Fig 4a, is very congested with overlaps between arrows and figures and it is very hard to read and understand what the different notations mean.\n\nI think, overall, the paper needs an overhaul to first make sure that the various components used in the pipeline are explained properly, make sure the figures are clear, the notations are clear especially in the earlier sections. I think further advantages can be gaining incites from papers that talk about importance of various layers (Zhang et. al. 2019), using low rank layers or representations etc and doing comparisons with other works that claim to provide an improvement in encrypted prediction latency.\n\nZhang, C., Bengio, S., & Singer, Y.

Channel-wise approximation of activations.  We identify the performance bottleneck of existing cryptographic inference is still activation function. We then propose channel-wise activation approximation to replace more expensive GC-based activation with the cheap BT-based polynomials.\n- 2. More flexibility in the form of the polynomial approximation.  What polynomial should be used to approximate activation? It seems that higher polynomial approximation since it has less approximation error. However, the high-degree polynomial approximation (degree>3) will introduce poor training accuracy, due to the exploding gradients.  And previous works usually use degree-2 square polynomial. As far as the author knows, we are the first to support the flexibility in the degree of polynomial, e.g. we support the hybrid using of degree-3, degree-2 and degree-0 polynomials. Degree-0 polynomials can be seen as channel pruning.    \n- 3. BTPBT hyper-parameter search. How to perform channel-wise activation replacement and flexible polynomial at the same time? We model it as a hyper-parameter optimization problem.  This hyper-parameter optimization problem is not trivial. Hand-crafted methods, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and even Population Based Training method are not suitable for this hyper-parameter optimization problem due to its enormous search space. We propose binary-tree based PBT (BTPBT) algorithm to solve this problem.\n\n##### Question 2. The performance improvement is not very large (e.g. 0.62x improvement on Delphi for ResNet 32 inference).\nAnswer 2:\n- First, we added new results in the table 2-4 of revised manuscript to show that SAFENet also has the ability to improve accuracy other than reducing latency. SAFENet is able to reduce latency by 38\\% ~ 61\\% or imporve accuracy by 1.8% ~ 4% over prior techniques.\n- Secondly, SAFENet reduces the total inference time of ResNet-32 from 204 seconds to the 128 seconds and improves inference accuracy by more than 0.2% at the same time. We believe that 76 seconds inference latency reduction is important for the real-life applications; When we use the Delphi-Fast to approximate more activations than Delphi, shown in Table 4 in the revision,  the accuracy of Delphi-Fast is decreased 1.6\\% with only a  ~6 seconds latency reduction.  Our work SAFENet improves 1.8\\% inference accuracy and reduces 35.8\\% latency over Delphi-Fast at the same time.  \n- Thirdly, SAFENet has a large performance improvement on the online phase. For example, the online time of our baseline Delphi using CNN-7 on CIFAR-10  is 2.9x of SAFENet as Table 2 shows. It is a fact that online time is much more important than total running time, since the offline phase of inference can be processed in advance. \n\n##### Question 3. Comparison with TAPAS[1] and SHE[2].\nAnswer 3: We thank the reviewer for pointing these related works. We added the comparison of TAPAS[1] , SHE[2] and our work SAFENet in the related work of the revised manuscript. TAPAS uses  HE-based binary neural networks which adapts $sign()$ function instead of the activation, thereby suffering from more inference accuracy loss ($<99$\\% accuracy on MNIST) than approximated ReLU function ($>99$\\% accuracy on MNIST). And TAPAS and SHE suffer from long-latency linear operations since they use a HE scheme called TFHE[3] that does not support ciphertext batching operations yet. For example, TAPAS and SHE take $\\sim$2 hour and ~10 seconds respectively to perform one single MNIST inference with ~99\\% accuracy. In contrast, our work SAFENet and Gazelle using the hybrid of batched HE and MPC are able to achieve $<1$-second latency with $>99$\\% accuracy.\n\n[1] Sanyal, Amartya, Matt, Kusner, Adria, Gascon, and Varun, Kanade. \"TAPAS: Tricks to Accelerate (encrypted) Prediction As a Service.\" .

Deriving public meta-parameters from data might impact privacy.\n\nAnswer 1:  We sincerely appreciate this instructive review. We have added the following description into the manuscript (page 6): \nOur BTPBT takes the all-$ReLU$ neural network model $M_T$ and training data $D$ as inputs in the server side, and outputs a well-trained polynomial-approximated neural network $P_T$. The $P_T$ is used to provide a privacy-preserving machine learning inference service that takes the client\u2019s encrypted sensitive data $D_{inf}$ as input, and outputs the encrypted prediction result to the client. So our BTPBT does NOT impact the privacy of user's data $D_{inf}$. Our BTBPT shares the same threat model with our baseline Delphi [1]. \n\n[1] Mishra, Pratyush, Ryan, Lehmkuhl, Akshayaram, Srinivasan, Wenting, Zheng, and Raluca Ada, Popa. \"DELPHI: A cryptographic inference service for neural networks.\" . In USENIX Security.2020.\n\n\n##### Question 2. The further exploration of when to replace ReLU with polynomial seems somewhat expectable despite the novelty of the approach. \n\nAnswer 2: \n- It is somewhat expectable that we can replace some ReLU without a large accuracy decrease. However, it is unexpectable to decide which channels should be replaced since the accuracy is sensitive to the activation channel [2] and channels are of joint impact on the accuracy. It is also unexpectable to decide which polynomial is better to approximate the ReLU. It seems that higher polynomial approximation has less approximation error. However, the high-degree polynomial approximation (degree>3) will introduce poor training accuracy, due to the exploding gradient of high-degree polynomial.  And previous works usually use degree-2 square polynomial. As far as the author knows, we are the first to support the flexibility in the degree of polynomial which enables a 1.8%-4% accuracy improvement under the same latency constraint. \n- Secondly, as the reviewer 4 mentioned, we have mainly three novel contributions: 1. Channel-wise approximation of activations.  2. More flexibility in the form of the polynomial approximation.  3. BTPBT hyper-parameter search.\n\n[2] He, Yihui, Ji, Lin, Zhijian, Liu, Hanrui, Wang, Li-Jia, Li, and Song, Han. \"Amc: Automl for model compression and acceleration on mobile devices.\" .

Modest improvement (only 2$\\times$ improvement) in latency.\nAnswer 1: \n-\tFirst, we added new results in the table 2~4 of the revised manuscript to show that SAFENet also has the ability to improve accuracy other than reducing latency. SAFENet is able to reduce latency by 38\\% ~  61\\% or imporve accuracy by 1.8\\% ~ 4\\% over prior techniques.\n-\tSecondly, SAFENet reduces the total inference time of VGG-16 from 172 seconds to the 104 seconds and improves inference accuracy by more than 0.8% at the same time. We believe that the reduction of 68 seconds inference latency is important for the real-life applications. When we use the Delphi-Fast to approximate more activations than Delphi, shown in Table 4 in the revision, the accuracy of Delphi-Fast is decreased decreased 3.2\\% with only a  ~6 seconds latency reduction.  Our work SAFENet improves 4\\% inference accuracy and reduces 37.3\\% latency over Delphi-Fast at the same time.  \n-\tThirdly, SAFENet has a large performance improvement on online time. For example, the online time of our baseline Delphi using CNN-7 on CIFAR-10  is 2.9$\\times$ of SAFENet as Table 2 shows. It is a fact that online time is much more important than total running time since the offline phase of total running time can be processed in advance.\n\n\n##### Question 2. Is the accuracy of the three networks from Figure 4b comparable?\nAnswer 2: Yes. The three networks including DRL, PBT and our BTPBT are implemented under the same accuracy threshold, called $A_t$. In the Figure 4b, the accuracy constraint is 85%. \n\n\n##### Question 3. Fig.5 caption typos.\nAnswer 3: We sincerely appreciate this instructive review. We have fixed it in the revised manuscript.\n\n\n##### Question 4. Source of the 10\\% improvement in the runtime of the linear layers when compared with Delphi.\nAnswer 4: The source of the 10\\% improvement is degree-0 activation polynomial approximation that is a channel pruning. In other words, the convolution in the channel of degree-0 activation is not required to computed. So that HE-based linear operations number is reduced. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper686/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper686/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SAFENet: A Secure, Accurate and Fast Neural Network Inference", "authorids": ["~Qian_Lou1", "~Yilin_Shen1", "~Hongxia_Jin1", "~Lei_Jiang1"], "authors": ["Qian Lou", "Yilin Shen", "Hongxia Jin", "Lei Jiang"], "keywords": ["Cryptographic inference", "Channel-Wise Approximated Activation", "Hyper-Parameter Optimization", "Garbled Circuits"], "abstract": "The advances in neural networks have driven many companies to provide prediction services to users in a wide range of applications.

The main contribution is activation layers that are more expensive in two-party computation are replaced by approximations dynamically based on the training data. To this end, the authors use a divide-and-conquer approach to gauge the impact of replacing activation functions of some layers by a version more amenable to secure computation. Furthermore, the algorithm also considers various degrees for approximation (0, 2, and 3). Experiments show that this reduces the latency by up to two thirds while maintaining a similar accuracy.\n\nPros:\n- The dynamic approach is more sophisticated.\n- The improvement in efficiency is clear.\n\nCons:\n- Deriving public meta-parameters from data might impact privacy, but no consideration is given to this aspect.\n- The further exploration of when to replace ReLU with an approximation seems somewhat expectable despite the novelty of the exact approach.\n\nMinor issues:\n- 1: \"huge\" (unscholarly language)\n- throughout: \"Delphi Mishra et al.\" - maybe \"Delphi by Mishra et al.\"?\n- References: curly brackets in several references such as {USENIX}\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend acceptance given the novelty.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper686/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper686/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SAFENet: A Secure, Accurate and Fast Neural Network Inference", "authorids": ["~Qian_Lou1", "~Yilin_Shen1", "~Hongxia_Jin1", "~Lei_Jiang1"], "authors": ["Qian Lou", "Yilin Shen", "Hongxia Jin", "Lei Jiang"], "keywords": ["Cryptographic inference", "Channel-Wise Approximated Activation", "Hyper-Parameter Optimization", "Garbled Circuits"], "abstract": "The advances in neural networks have driven many companies to provide prediction services to users in a wide range of applications. However, current prediction systems raise privacy concerns regarding the user's private data. A cryptographic neural network inference service is an efficient way to allow two parties to execute neural network inference without revealing either party\u2019s data or model. Nevertheless, existing cryptographic neural network inference services suffer from huge running latency; in particular, the latency of communication-expensive cryptographic activation function is 3 orders of magnitude higher than plaintext-domain activation function. And activations are the necessary components of the modern neural networks. Therefore, slow cryptographic activation has become the primary obstacle of efficient cryptographic inference. \n\nIn this paper, we propose a new technique, called SAFENet, to enable a Secure, Accurate and Fast nEural Network inference service. To speedup secure inference and guarantee inference accuracy, SAFENet includes channel-wise activation approximation with multiple-degree options. This is implemented by keeping the most useful activation channels and replacing the remaining, less useful, channels with various-degree polynomials. SAFENet also supports mixed-precision activation approximation by automatically assigning different replacement ratios to various layer; further increasing the approximation ratio and reducing inference latency.
