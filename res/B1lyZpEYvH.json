We show that our model provides meaningful interpretable masks while achieving better performance than other models.\n\nWe would like to answer to your comments:\n\n-\t\u201cclaiming that the method is more useful for interpretability / justification doesn't seem so convincing these days unless you can make a stronger argument as to how it could actually be used to generate justifications that would be shown to users \u2026 But this doesn't seem so different from how older methods (e.g. Bag-of-Words based techniques for multi-aspect sentiment classification), though their labels were possibly at the level of sentences rather than reviews.\u201d\nAs shown in Figure 2 and Appendices A.3.1-3, the end goal of the method is to provide interpretability towards each aspect and either show it to a user (for example while a user reads reviews of an hotel, he or she could directly see what part of the reviews talk about what aspect) or use generated masks in other tasks such as recommender system, review summarization etc.\nMoreover, our method is different as it predicts the sentiment towards an aspect and highlights one or several sequences of words justifying the prediction (see Section 2).\n \n-\t\u201cPerhaps I missed some detail explaining why such a comparison is impossible, but there seems to be no direct comparison against traditional techniques for multi-aspect sentiment analysis.\u201d\nOur method is different than traditional methods because it provides interpretability in addition to sentiments towards each aspect, as highlighted in the Introduction, Section 2.3 and 3.1.\n\n-\t\u201cThere's little by way of human evaluation (there's a bit in the appendix, but it's not really focused on whether or not the model is useful for the claimed purpose of \"explanation\").\u201d \u201cMore positively, the authors have done *a lot* by way of experiments, in terms of ablations, and showing quantitative performance from different dimensions. The appendix is detailed and shows many examples. Overall I feel somewhat borderline about this paper, because there's a lot here, but I feel some of these key components mentioned above are missing.\u201d\nWe quantitively evaluate interpretability in Table 4 (on an annotated dataset) and Table 5 (topic model metrics). We qualitatively show the interpretability of our masks in Figure 2 and Appendices A.3.1-3 on 6 samples.

We were able to incorporate your suggestions and believe it has strengthened our paper. \n\nWe have updated our results by including the \u201cMajority Sentiment\u201d baseline you proposed and using NB-SVM on the three datasets. Regarding your last remark, our model MAM provides better interpretability with a single training (see Section 4.4 and 4.5) and outperforms other models on two out of three datasets and is competitive on the Hotel dataset. We also show that by using the mask as additional features on a smaller model, we obtain the best results across all the datasets, while providing the same interpretability.\n\nWe would like to insist on the novelty of our approach. As pointed out in Section 3 (the paragraph above Equation 2) and Section 2.2, the novelty of the method is 1) the use of two regularizers to control the number of selected words and encourage consecutive words to be selected, and 2) the normalization not done over the sequence length but over the aspects and non-aspect set (the Masker component).\nAs a consequence, across three datasets, our model outperforms strong baselines and generates masks that are: strong feature predictors, meaningful, and interpretable. The Figure 2 and Appendices A.3.1-3 qualitatively show that our model highlights texts that are more meaningful. In addition, Table 4 quantitively underlines that MAM obtained significantly higher precision of selected words for each aspect, on an annotated dataset; Table 5 shows similar trends with topic model metrics.\n\nRegarding your comment about the aspect correlation, we find the idea very interesting. However, we don\u2019t see clearly how you would compute the aspect correlation for a single review as we could do it only on the whole dataset, as shown in Table 6 in Appendix A.1.

This paper has some variation on this old problem in the sense that it's more focused on generating explanations / justifications rather than purely on sentiment analysis.\n\nAlthough an interesting variant on a (somewhat niche) existing problem, I do feel that some aspects of this paper are a little dated -- claiming that the method is more useful for interpretability / justification doesn't seem so convincing these days unless you can make a stronger argument as to how it could actually be used to generate justifications that would be shown to users. I don't really see that in the current version. At the moment the output of the system appears to be attention weights over several aspects, showing which words in a review focus on which aspect. But this doesn't seem so different from how older methods (e.g. Bag-of-Words based techniques for multi-aspect sentiment classification), though their labels were possibly at the level of sentences rather than reviews.\n\nThe actual method itself seems appropriate, and is a nice update on previous techniques for multi-aspect sentiment analysis.\n\nPerhaps I missed some detail explaining why such a comparison is impossible, but there seems to be no direct comparison against traditional techniques for multi-aspect sentiment analysis. E.g. aren't even traditional models (like say Titov & McDonald) comparable to this? I understand the goal is somewhat different, but the input/output modality seems similar and such a comparison could be helpful.\n\nOverall, I think these days the standard is quite high for papers that make claims about generating convincing justifications/interpretations/explanations. There's little by way of human evaluation (there's a bit in the appendix, but it's not really focused on whether or not the model is useful for the claimed purpose of \"explanation\").\n\nMore positively, the authors have done *a lot* by way of experiments, in terms of ablations, and showing quantitative performance from different dimensions. The appendix is detailed and shows many examples. Overall I feel somewhat borderline about this paper, because there's a lot here, but I feel some of these key components mentioned above are missing."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper360/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper360/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Dimensional Explanation of Reviews", "authors": ["Diego Antognini", "Claudiu Musat", "Boi Faltings"], "authorids": ["diego.antognini@epfl.ch", "claudiu.musat@swisscom.com", "boi.faltings@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "explanation", "interpretability", "reviews", "multi-aspect", "sentiment analysis", "mask"], "TL;DR": "Neural model predicting multi-aspect sentiments and generating a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask simultaneously.

Apart from sentiment classification, the architecture is able to return a mask for each aspect highlighting the sequences of words used to make the sentiment prediction for that aspect. This improves the interpretability of the model. The aspects are fixed and the training set requires a multi-labeled dataset with one binary positive/negative label per aspect.\n\nThe network architecture is mostly standard: a text review is turned into a list of word embeddings which are fed through a trainable masker outputting one mask per aspect, essentially \"selecting\" a different set of words (embeddings) per aspect. From here on, a standard encoder can be used (the authors end up using a CNN with max-pooling but LSTM or other could be used), followed by a classification step (standard MLP) outputting a sentiment score per aspect. A couple tricks are used to make the masks converge to something meaningful by adding regularization terms to control the number of selected words and encouraging consecutive words to be selected.\n\nI'm leaning toward rejection partly due to the limited novelty in the approach but mainly due to the experimental evaluation section which requires improvements.\n- High aspect correlation baseline: the average aspect correlation across reviews in the training set is high (that is, if one aspect is positive, most aspects will be and viceversa). A natural baseline to include is the optimal \"no-aspect\" decision boundary: in other words, if for each review we were given the majority rating across aspects (is this review mostly positive or negative) and were able to predict this always correctly, what would the macro-aspect F1 score be if we were to simply predict that label to all aspect of that review?\n- Please quantify how much does your model rely on this aspect correlation. For example, if you were to sort the reviews in the validation set by their aspect correlation, and chart the F1 score as a function of the prefix of this sorted dataset what would we see? This would be especially telling when comparing the different baselines and classifiers again each other in this chart.\n- SVM: you mentioned not running it on the larger datasets due to lengthy training time. I would suggest including NB-SVM implemented with logistic regression rather than actual SVM since it's always a great baseline and fast to compute (in \"Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification\").\n- The final model that ends up giving the best results is really a 2-step pipeline (rather than end-to-end trainable) and requires training twice: once to learn the masks and once to actually train the rest of the network after the word embeddings are extended with the masks.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper360/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper360/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Dimensional Explanation of Reviews", "authors": ["Diego Antognini", "Claudiu Musat", "Boi Faltings"], "authorids": ["diego.antognini@epfl.ch", "claudiu.musat@swisscom.com", "boi.faltings@epfl.ch"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "explanation", "interpretability", "reviews", "multi-aspect", "sentiment analysis", "mask"], "TL;DR": "Neural model predicting multi-aspect sentiments and generating a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask simultaneously.

In our work, we propose a neural model for predicting multi-aspect sentiments for reviews and generates a probabilistic multi-dimensional mask (one per aspect) simultaneously, in an unsupervised and multi-task learning manner. Our evaluation shows that on three datasets, in the beer and hotel domain, our model outperforms strong baselines and generates masks that are: strong feature predictors, meaningful, and interpretable.", "pdf": "/pdf/a59a7aa43aec3f41748e4ddf2657d565b4240eae.pdf", "paperhash": "antognini|multidimensional_explanation_of_reviews", "original_pdf": "/attachment/27e527b9e344ee09815370e4596af60f5f1e0e28.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nantognini2020multidimensional,\ntitle={Multi-Dimensional Explanation of Reviews},\nauthor={Diego Antognini and Claudiu Musat and Boi Faltings},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lyZpEYvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
