We make the following response:\ni- The loss function of CatGAN ([1]) is composed from several entropy terms. Since the integration of the partition function is not needed in this case, we see it as a specific form of energy function, as opposed to the probabilistic functions. That being said, CatGAN can be categorized into the EBGAN framework. The unique thing it possesses is its energy function not only takes $x$ (or $G(z)$) but also takes a virtual label variable $y$.\ni- The connection to the work [2], is not as strong as implied by the title of the paper. This proposed framework doesn't get rid of the computational challenging partition function, so the choice of the energy function is required to be integratable. Our work is proposed from an opposite angle where the energy function is completely free of the integral of the probability density, which provides more freedom for the choice of loss functional.\nii- Admittedly, we lack a well-formed methodology for comparison besides visual generation. However, we claim that for LSUN bedroom generation in figure 5, some flaw is seen in the DCGAN generation, such as the blue-bed alike generation appearing in the images located at 1r6c, 2r3c, 3r1c, 4r4c, 4r7c, 7r4c (1r6c means 1st row 6th column). The identically configured EBGAN auto-encoder model trained with PT term (EBGAN-PT) excludes such flaw. Furthermore, we claim in figure 6, EBGAN-PT produces higher quality generation than DCGAN if examining closely.\niii- Thanks for pointing this out. We're launching some grid search experiments on the EBGAN-PT model. We will update the paper with this result when the experiments are finished.\n\nFor the special comments:\ni-We made some justification as to why an auto-encoder could work as a discriminator in the upfront two bullets of section 2.3. Briefly, the idea is that an auto-encoder could provide richer information than a scalar-output network where only a single bit is used at one time. And the auto-encoders are well-studied energy-based models themselves. Training an auto-encoder with real samples alone is also providing information of the data manifold, unlike a binary-classifier to which feeding mere real samples doesn't make sense.\nii-We'll change it.\niii-We indeed use a three-layer ConvNets as the offline trained classifier. We inherit the name \u201cinception-score\u201d from the Improved-GAN paper ([3]) where the score was originally proposed. In our MNIST experiments, the inception score has *nothing* to do with the inception model trained on ImageNet. We apologize for this confusion. Some clarification of this is available in the Appendix C.\niv-We'll try to make the histograms look better in the next version.\nv-The existence of Nash Equilibrium is proven by two steps: (i)-given enough capacity of G and D, there must exist a model pair (G*, D*) that can satisfy both condition (a) and (b) in the theorem 2; (ii)-by using the sufficient condition of theorem 2 would give us a Nash Equilibrium which is defined by equation 3 and 4.\n\nOverall, we will update the paper shortly by adding some of the comments above and correcting the typos and minor mistakes in the next revision.

Their approach uses a standard probabilistic GAN, and cast it into an energy model (using Gibbs distributions). That allows them to learn a discriminator that models the distribution when a Nash equilibrium is reached. On the other hand, our approach gets rid of the probabilistic setting, while presenting the same Nash equilibrium as a standard GAN, but through a different and more generalized class of loss functionals (experiences also show that it can make the training easier). \n\nSecond, as we mentioned in the comment to the pre-review question, we did some near-ablation study on the hinge loss in Appendix E, where it shows up the interpolation between small and large margin value. For the auto-encoder part, the main focus of this paper is to explore one particular form of discriminator and theoretically prove a wide family of the choices for the discriminator. Furthermore, techniques introduced in this work such as the PT term and the combination with Ladder Network are all grounded on the encoder-decoder reconstruction structure.\n\nWe\u2019ll update the paper shortly to reflect the above clarification.

We also show comparisons with and without the PT term in the appendix.\n\nWe focus our paper on the auto-encoder setting, though. We justify the use of the auto-encoder setting in the paper (section 2.3). We feel it does not make much sense to run the EBGAN without the auto-encoder but with the PT term. Indeed, the PT term assumes the features planes are different for different \"fake\" inputs. This in indeed correct when using an auto-encoder, since the information has to be there for the reconstruction. When using a single-valued discriminator, the only information that matters is \"real\" versus \"fake\", so there is no reason for the feature planes of two different \"fake\" samples to be different. Actually, they are encouraged to be similar.\n\nWe acknowledge that there is more experimentation to be done, in particular on other form of discriminators.

As far as I know energy-based GANs (EBGAN) were introduced in Kim and Bengio (2016), but the proposed version makes a number of different design choices. \n\nFirst, it does away with the entropy regularization term that Kim and Bengio (2016) introduced to ensure that the GAN discriminator converged to an energy function proportional to the log density of the data (at optimum). This implies that the discriminator in the proposed scheme will become uniform at convergence as discussed in the theoretical section of the paper, however the introductory text seems to imply otherwise -- that one could recover a meaningful score function from the trained energy-function (discriminator). This should be clarified. \n\nSecond, this version of the EBGAN setting includes two innovations: (1) the introduction of the hinge loss in the value function, and (2) the use of an auto-encoder parametrization for the energy function. These innovations are not empirically justified in any way - this is disappointing, as it would be really good to see empirical results supporting the arguments made in support of their introduction. \n\nThe two significant contributions of this paper are the theoretical analysis of the energy-baesd GAN formalism (showing that the optimum corresponds to a Nash equilibrium) and the impressive empirical results on large images that set a new standard in what straight GAN-style models can achieve.\n\nThe theoretical results seem solid to me and make a nice contribution.\n\nRegarding the quantitative results in Table 2, it seems not appropriate to bold the EBGAN line when it seems to be statistically indistinguishable form the Rasmus et al (2015) results. Though it is not mentioned here, the use of bold typically indicates the state-of-the-art. \n\nI think this paper could be be much stronger if the two novel contributions to the energy-based GAN setting were more thoroughly explored with ablation experiments. That being said, I think this paper has already become a contribution other are building on (including at least two other ICLR submissions) and so I think it should be accepted for publication at ICLR. \n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "We introduce the \"Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network\" model (EBGAN) which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low energies to the regions near the data manifold and higher energies to other regions.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that such paradigm separates training D and G, it could not achieve the goal of adversarial training, i.e., finding a Nash Equilibrium of system (D, G). The generated samples did not look anything like real samples. \n\nFor one thing, on the starting stage of training G, where the produced fake samples $G(z)$ are very far away from the data manifold, the goal of adversarial training is to bring it close to the data manifold by giving G some useful gradient from D. However, since D is trained beforehand with just real samples, it never sees the statistics of the fake samples. So without the interaction (letting D be trained with fake samples as in GAN or EBGAN), the gradient is likely degenerated.\n\nFor another, from the theoretical perspective, the goal of EBGAN and GAN is to find a Nash Equilibrium (as explained in section 2.2). Unless training D alone by real dataset converges to a global optimum D* with respect to any G, the (D, G) system cannot reach any Nash Equilibrium because when G reaches a minimum, the frozen D won\u2019t be optimal any more.\n\nWe claimed in section 2.3 that using an auto-encoder as the discriminator is a promising choice because the phase of training D on real samples also contributes to the discovery of the data manifold (further we postulate the provided gradient from D is more stable and provides richer information).
