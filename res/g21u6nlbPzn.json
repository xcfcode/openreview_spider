Below we address R1\u2019s concern on results of X3D model on Kinetics-400.  \n\n**(a) Difference in X3D-M results:** Until the submission of this paper, the X3D authors hadn't released their official code for the implementation of their models. Thus, despite our best efforts, the implementation details of our reproduced version may be slightly different from the original X3D. During the rebuttal period, we re-launched our  X3D experiments on Kinetics-400 with the official implementation which was released recently and updated the results in Table 5 of the revised version. Our adaptive approach still outperforms X3D by 1.8% in top-1 video accuracy, while reducing computation (GFLOPs) by a margin of about 16.1%  on Kinetics-400 dataset. Note that while the updated performance of X3D is improved by 2.7% (67.9 vs 70.6),  it is still different from the original paper, which we believe is due to the difference in dataset size as Kinetics-400 is shrinking in size (about ~15% of the videos are missing) and the original version is no longer available from the official site, resulting in some difference of results. Another possible reason could be due to some additional tricks used by X3D to further boost the performance that are currently not included in the official implementation. The main difference in FLOPs comes from the fact that we report our results based on 256x256 input resolution while they show results with 224x224 input resolution.\n\n**(b) Reduce ratio fact for channel-wise dynamic convolution.** Thanks for R1\u2019s kindly reminder, we have revised this in our updated PDF."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper948/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper948/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VA-RED$^2$: Video Adaptive Redundancy Reduction", "authorids": ["~Bowen_Pan2", "~Rameswar_Panda1", "~Camilo_Luciano_Fosco1", "~Chung-Ching_Lin2", "~Alex_J_Andonian1", "~Yue_Meng1", "~Kate_Saenko1", "~Aude_Oliva1", "~Rogerio_Feris1"], "authors": ["Bowen Pan", "Rameswar Panda", "Camilo Luciano Fosco", "Chung-Ching Lin", "Alex J Andonian", "Yue Meng", "Kate Saenko", "Aude Oliva", "Rogerio Feris"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Performing inference on deep learning models for videos remains a challenge due to the large amount of computational resources required to achieve robust recognition.

The GFLOPs indeed can not completely reflect the actual speed of each model, particularly on GPUs.  Following R2\u2019s suggestion, we add the \u201cspeed\u201d  (measured in terms of clip/second, which denotes the number of video clips that are processed in one second) column to most of our tables in the revised version. We created the environment with PyTorch 1.6, CUDA 11.0, and a single NVIDIA TITAN RTX (24GB) GPU as our testbed. Although we devise our framework mainly based on the efficiency in terms of FLOPs, our method still has advantages regarding actual speed. For instance, for the I3D_v2 model with 16 frames on the action recognition task, our method boosts its speed by 21.7% (141.7 clip/second vs 116.4 clip/second). Likewise, for the R(2+1)D  model with 16 frames, our method boosts its speed by 10.6% (108.7 clip/second vs 97.1 clip/second) (Table 2 in the revised version). \n\n**(b) Differences in search w.r.t X3D.** Our search strategy is completely different from X3D in three different aspects. **(a) Objective of searching.** What X3D searches for is a fixed optimal combination of temporal stride, channel width, input resolution and model depth. On the other hand, we search for a policy which dynamically predicts the ratio of features which are redundant for each input instance so that we can replace them with cheaply-obtained features. In other words, our proposed approach makes decisions on a per-input basis, leading to different amounts of computation for different videos,  in contrast to the one-size-fits-all scheme used by X3D.  **(b) Searching methodology.** X3D follows a heuristic searching methodology, which gradually expands the dimension of each factor and manually compares models with different expanded factors. However, our method utilizes a learning-based searching methodology, which adopts light-weight policy layers with the efficiency loss to learn to decide how many features are needed. **(c) Searching direction.** X3D starts searching from an efficient simple base model with gradually increasing FLOPs. However, our method starts from a redundant base model and searches to reduce the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our dynamic approach achieves 16% reduction in computation over X3D without any performance loss, for video action recognition tasks. Besides X3D, our approach also outperforms R2+1D, I3D, TPN, CorrNet in both accuracy and efficiency,  which shows that our approach is model-agnostic, and hence can be served as a plugin operation for a wide range of action recognition architectures.\n\n**(c) Motivation and contribution of efficiency loss.** The goal of our paper is to customize the dynamic network architecture with the minimal computation for each input instance. Specifically, the core idea of this paper is that we want to dynamically decide how many features should be replaced by the cheaply-obtained feature. Thus the motivation of devising our efficiency loss is to maximize the ratio of cheaply-obtained features during the training phase, which is a necessary part of the whole VA-RED^2 framework. And the contribution of the efficiency loss is that it significantly reduces the computational cost as  can be  seen from Table 9 of the main paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper948/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper948/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VA-RED$^2$: Video Adaptive Redundancy Reduction", "authorids": ["~Bowen_Pan2", "~Rameswar_Panda1", "~Camilo_Luciano_Fosco1", "~Chung-Ching_Lin2", "~Alex_J_Andonian1", "~Yue_Meng1", "~Kate_Saenko1", "~Aude_Oliva1", "~Rogerio_Feris1"], "authors": ["Bowen Pan", "Rameswar Panda", "Camilo Luciano Fosco", "Chung-Ching Lin", "Alex J Andonian", "Yue Meng", "Kate Saenko", "Aude Oliva", "Rogerio Feris"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Performing inference on deep learning models for videos remains a challenge due to the large amount of computational resources required to achieve robust recognition.

On the other hand, our method focuses on reducing the temporal redundancy among the features of a series of consecutive frames and the spatial redundancy among a set of output features by replacing the redundant features with cheaply-obtained features. Thus, our method and AR-Net are fundamentally quite different as AR-Net does not reconstruct redundant feature maps using cheap linear operations. **(b) Model memory.** AR-Net adopts several independent networks corresponding to different input resolutions to adaptively infer the video, which makes the model size significantly larger than the original model. While our method integrates all of our possible network architectures into a shared-weight super network, the parameter size of whom is just slightly larger (almost the same) than the original model. **(c) Scope of application.** AR-Net is only applicable to 2D video models, like Temporal Segment Network (TSN). In contrast,  our VA-RED^2 framework is model-agnostic and hence can be applied to a wide- variety of action recognition architectures including  2D, (2+1)D, and 3D video models, like (R(2+1)D, X3D, I3D). Moreover, while AR-Net is only limited to action recognition, our dynamic framework is generalizable to not only video action recognition but also to spatio-temporal action localization and dense segmentation tasks, achieving promising results over competing methods.\n\n**(b) Experimental-level comparison with AR-Net.** Following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we compare our method with AR-Net using 16-frame TSN ResNet50 on Mini-Kinetics-200 and observe that our method has advantages on the FLOPs, model size, and performance,  e.g., our approach outperforms AR-Net in both top-1 clip accuracy  (67.2 vs 68.3) and FLOPS (44.8G vs 43.4G), while using about 62% less parameters (63.0M vs 23.9M). We have added this result in the updated version ( see Table 4 (Right) of the revised paper). \n\n**(c) Missing references.** Thanks for pointing out these to us! We have updated the related work section to reflect these relevant works in the revised version. Besides, we conducted additional experiments of our method with one of these SOTA models, CorrNet [1] with R(2+1)D backbone, the results of which are listed in Table 4 (Left) of the revised paper. Experimental results show that our dynamic approach outperforms the baseline CorrNet by 1.8% in top-1 video accuracy (68.2 vs 70.0), while reducing the computational cost/FLOPS  by 25.2%  (60.8G vs 45.5G) on Mini-Kinetics-200 dataset.\n\n**(d) VA-RED^2 with dense video understanding tasks.** Our adaptive approach for redundancy reduction is a general framework which can be applied to different types of video  tasks, not limited to action recognition. Specifically, our method can be applied to dense video understanding tasks, like video semantic understanding, as long as there exists redundancy in the temporal or channel dimension of videos. To prove this, we conducted an experiment by applying our method to a semantic segmentation model to remove the channel-wise redundancy. The results are reported in Table 11 in our updated paper. The experiments are conducted on ADE20K dataset [2] with the PSPNet [3], where we choose the dilated ResNet-18 as our backbone architecture. We can see that our method significantly boosts the efficiency of the segmentation model as our method can save around 26.4% computational cost of the original model while maintaining the accuracy.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Wang et al.

To do so, given the input frames, the framework predicts two scaling factors to conduct temporal and channel dimension reduction. The remaining part is reconstructed by cheap operations. The authors show that the framework achieves favorable results on several benchmarks.\n\nStrengths\n+ The paper is well written.\n+ Strong quantitative and qualitative results (Consistent improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines).\n+ Solid ablation studies and analysis.\n\nWeakness\n- The core idea of using a light-weight neural module to maximize the video model efficiency is not novel.\nFor example, AR-Net already has shown that a policy network can decide the video input resolution, i.e., spatial dimension, adaptively, leading to improve both efficiency and accuracy. In this work, the key concept is basically the same and only the primitive operation unit, i.e., temporal and channel dimensions, is different.\n\n- Please provide experiment-level comparisons with AR-Net\n\n- The following SOTA video models are missing in the reference.\nDynamoNet: Dynamic action and motion network, ICCV 2019\nVideo Modeling with Correlation Networks, CVPR 2020\nRubiksNet: Learnable 3D-Shift for Efficient Video Action Recognition, ECCV2020\nDirectional Temporal Modeling for Action Recognition, ECCV2020\n\nQuestion\n\n- Can the idea be applied to dense video understanding tasks, such as video semantic segmentation?\n\nRating\n\n- Aiming at acquiring an efficient model in a data-driven manner is indeed important for video models.\nWhile the key idea is not novel, the paper has obvious empirical contributions that may help communities to invigorate future researches in this direction. \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper948/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper948/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "VA-RED$^2$: Video Adaptive Redundancy Reduction", "authorids": ["~Bowen_Pan2", "~Rameswar_Panda1", "~Camilo_Luciano_Fosco1", "~Chung-Ching_Lin2", "~Alex_J_Andonian1", "~Yue_Meng1", "~Kate_Saenko1", "~Aude_Oliva1", "~Rogerio_Feris1"], "authors": ["Bowen Pan", "Rameswar Panda", "Camilo Luciano Fosco", "Chung-Ching Lin", "Alex J Andonian", "Yue Meng", "Kate Saenko", "Aude Oliva", "Rogerio Feris"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Performing inference on deep learning models for videos remains a challenge due to the large amount of computational resources required to achieve robust recognition. An inherent property of real-world videos is the high correlation of information across frames which can translate into redundancy in either temporal or spatial feature maps of the models, or both. The type of redundant features depends on the dynamics and type of events in the video: static videos have more temporal redundancy while videos focusing on objects tend to have more channel redundancy. Here we present a redundancy reduction framework, termed VA-RED$^2$, which is input-dependent. Specifically, our VA-RED$^2$ framework uses an input-dependent policy to decide how many features need to be computed for temporal and channel dimensions. To keep the capacity of the original model, after fully computing the necessary features, we reconstruct the remaining redundant features from those using cheap linear operations. We learn the adaptive policy jointly with the network weights in a differentiable way with a shared-weight mechanism, making it highly efficient. Extensive experiments on multiple video datasets and different visual tasks show that our framework achieves $20\\% - 40\\%$ reduction in computation (FLOPs) when compared to state-of-the-art methods without any performance loss.
