Since Reviewer #1 did not submit a review and Reviewer #2 indicated that (s)he does not feel well-qualified to review this paper (it is very much on the theoretical side after all), it would be great to get one further review from an area chair or otherwise qualified person. \n\nMY EARLIER REVIEW\n=================\n\nThis this exciting submission presents a new proof of Leshno's version of the universal approximation property (UAP) for neural networks  -- one of the foundational pillars of our understanding of neural networks. The new proof provides new insights into the universal approximation property. I consider these the main contribution of the paper. Specifically, the authors\n- provide an upper bound on the required width for the neural network\n- show that the approximation property still holds even if strong further requirements are imposed on the weights of the first or last layer. \n\nI rate this submission a weak accept. It\u2019s a very good paper. The work makes useful contributions that should and will be of interest to many in the field. The paper is generally well-written. \n\n\nSome remarks:\n\n- Being somewhat long, the \u201cProof of Theorem 3.1\u201d would be a much better read if the authors prefixed it  with an outline of the strategy that the proof takes. \n\n- The authors point out that the lack of dependence of Theorem 3.1 on epsilon is surprising, and cite Lin\u2019s work from 2017 who previously found such an independence. Lin\u2019s derivation of the epsilon-independent UAP is much more intuitive than that of this submission, in which the epsilon independence really pops out somewhat magically and for me only made sense when I read the paper again. I would encourage the authors to add to Lin\u2019s paper\u2019s citation sentence that this paper motivates the epsilon independence well. Alternatively, the authors could add a few sentences to their paper to provide intuition on how the epsilon-independence comes about in their line of argument.

We believe the upper bound for $N$ in Theorem 3.2 is optimal, and we have included a new Appendix B in the revised paper to discuss this (conjectured) optimality. To put your question into context, it was conjectured by Mhaskar (1996) that there exists some smooth non-polynomial activation function such that at least $\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-n})$ hidden units is required to uniformly approximate every function in the class of $C^1$ functions with bounded Sobolev norm. Mhaskar provided a heuristic argument for why this conjecture should be true. If Mhaskar's conjecture is indeed true, then our upper bound in Theorem 3.2 is optimal.\nFor specific activation functions sigmoid and ReLU, it is already known that $(N \\log N) \\in \\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-n})$ for the class of $C^1$ functions with bounded Sobolev norm, so there is still a gap between the lower and upper bounds for $N$ in these specific cases. It would be interesting to find optimal bounds for these cases.\n\n(Reference to random features) Thank you for pointing this out! We have included a new paragraph in the Discussion section (Sec. 4).\n\n(clarity of proof of Thm 3.1) Following a suggestion by AnonReviewer3, we have prefixed the \"Proof of Theorem 3.1\" with an \"Outline of strategy for proving Theorem 3.1\".

Consequently, this property is inherited by continuous function approximation to which the result is extended (Thm 3.2).\n3.  This analysis and some of the results derived in the proof may be used for other analyses, e.g. representation power of multilayer networks.\n\nSome further discussion of the results may be of interest to the readers.  \n-  (Optimality of Thm 3.2).  When the result in Thm 3.1 is extended to general continous functions via Jackson's theorem, to what extend does the rate deteriorate?

Thm 3.3 appears to be related to random feature representation, whose approximating ability has been studied in prior works.  Some comment on those results may be beneficial (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04374).\n-  Although already a straightforward proof, it seems natural, and as a result may promote the presentation and clarity, to organize the proof to Thm 3.1 using smaller parts, which currently spans over 2 pages."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2288/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2288/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ernest_chong@sutd.edu.sg"], "title": "A closer look at the approximation capabilities of neural networks", "authors": ["Kai Fong Ernest Chong"], "pdf": "/pdf/f10b01ecfde24b3895c51f6e9d8be09686d118b2.pdf", "TL;DR": "A quantitative refinement of the universal approximation theorem via an algebraic approach.", "abstract": "The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions, says that if we consider only continuous activation functions \u03c3, then a standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous multivariate function f to any given approximation threshold \u03b5, if and only if \u03c3 is non-polynomial. In this paper, we give a direct algebraic proof of the theorem. Furthermore we shall explicitly quantify the number of hidden units required for approximation. Specifically, if X in R^n is compact, then a neural network with n input units, m output units, and a single hidden layer with {n+d choose d} hidden units (independent of m and \u03b5), can uniformly approximate any polynomial function f:X -> R^m whose total degree is at most d for each of its m coordinate functions. In the general case that f is any continuous function, we show there exists some N in O(\u03b5^{-n}) (independent of m), such that N hidden units would suffice to approximate f. We also show that this uniform approximation property (UAP) still holds even under seemingly strong conditions imposed on the weights. We highlight several consequences: (i) For any \u03b4 > 0, the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights w in the last layer to satisfy |w| < \u03b4.
