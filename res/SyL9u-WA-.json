The proposed reparametrization which is based on Singular Value Decomposition can be used for both recurrent and feedforward networks.\n\nThe paper is well-written and authors explain related work adequately. The paper is a follow up on Unitary RNNs which suggest a reparametrization that forces the transition matrix to be unitary. The problem of vanishing and exploding gradient in deep network is very challenging and any work that shed lights on this problem can have a significant impact. \n\nI have two comments on the experiment section:\n\n- Choice of experiments. Authors have chosen UCR datasets and MNIST for the experiments while other experiments are more common. For example, the adding problem, the copying problem and the permuted MNIST problem and language modeling are the common experiments in the context of RNNs. For feedforward settings, classification on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 is often reported.\n\n- Stopping condition. The plots suggest that the optimization has stopped earlier for some models. Is this because of some stopping condition or because of gradient explosion? Is there a way to avoid this?\n\n- Quality of figures. Figures are very hard to read because of small font.

We have carefully reorganized the paper to take into account your suggestions.\n\nSince our parameterization works for any real matrix, any weight matrix in CNN (e.g. filter matrix) can also be SVD parametrized.\nSince the gradient exploding/vanishing problem is generally considered more significant in RNN/MLP models than in CNN, we have not implement our algorithm as yet for CNNs.\n\n(Please also note that the state-of-the-art neural networks for image processing consists of both convolutional layers and fully-connected layers, like LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, or Inception, etc. We are already able to parameterize the fully connected layers using our scheme. )\n\nWe will explicitly explain in section 6.2 that we are talking about non-singular critical points. Our theory effectively states that our update rule avoids singular critical points, and thus spurious local minimum.\n\nIn Appendix C (experimental results), we have added experiments on widely used benchmarking RNN tasks like Adding and Copying tasks. In all experiments, svdRNN outperforms others expecially in capturing long-range dependencies. Also from the plots of (first layer) gradient magnitude, we can observe that svdRNN has much more stable gradient than that of RNN and LSTM, which could be the reason why it converges much faster.\n         \nThe efficiency and GPU utilization is indeed an important aspect.\nHowever, with efficient linear algebra algorithms, GPU utilization of our method can actually be quite high. The main part in our algorithm, where we multiply m Householder reflectors to the hidden matrix (stacking of hidden vector h's within a minibatch), can be done using blocked (BLAS3) algorithm widely used in QR decomposition.\nFor example, in LAPACK library, the corresponding subroutine is called 'DLARFT', while in MAGMA (LAPACK with GPU) it is called 'magma_cunmqr'. We plan to implement these blocked BLAS3 algorithms as part of our software in the near future."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stabilizing Gradients for Deep Neural Networks via Efficient SVD Parameterization", "abstract": "Vanishing and exploding gradients are two of the main obstacles in training deep neural networks, especially in capturing long range dependencies in recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
