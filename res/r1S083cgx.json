The paper is heavily oriented towards to chosen technologies and lacks in literature on sequence generation. In principle, rich literature on motion prediction for various applications could be relevant here. Recent models exist for sequence prediction (from primed inputs) for various applications, e.g. for skeleton data. These models learn complex motion w/o any pre-processing. \n\nEvaluation is a big concern. There is no quantitative evaluation. There is no comparision with other methods.\n\nI still wonder whether the intermediate representation (developed by Plamondon et al.) is useful in this context of a fully trained sequence generation model and whether the model could pick up the necessary transformations itself. This should be evaluated.\n\nDetails:\n\nThere are several typos and word omissions, which can be found by carefully rereading the paper.\n\nAt the beginning of section 3, it is still unclear what the application is.

This results in variations of the trajectories that are similar to the ones that can be seen in multiple instances of writing by one or more authors, and would be difficult to achieve by simply scaling the input dataset or perturbing the raw trajectory data-points.\n\n\nWhile a network will learn a sparse representation of the (online) data internally, we do not have much control on what this representation this will be, on its behaviour, on on how to control it. By using the Sigma-Lognormal model we abstract the complexity of motor execution, using a well studied human movement model, and thus simplify the task of the network to a motor-planning one.  We propose The Sigma-Lognormal representation results in a network output that is controllable and more easily manipulable (e.g in an interactive setting) than raw sequence data or than a latent representation learned by the network.\n\n\n It could be argued that a similar advantages would be given by parameterising the data as splines or Bezier curves, but the Sigma-Lognormal model provides the additional benefit of capturing the movement dynamics (velocity/acceleration) of the input data in a physiologically plausible manner.
