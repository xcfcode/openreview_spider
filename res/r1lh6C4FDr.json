Your feedbacks are very valuable and helpful in improving our work. However, some of your suggestions require large amount of computational power and redesigning of the experiments, and there are too many hyper-parameters to be controlled, which may require much more time for conducting careful experiments and reaching presentable results. We know that the proposed flexible sigmodal activtation function can improve the performance of stacked LSTM models on forecasting G7 and G20 indices as a whole. Also, the regularization effect should be even significant for large models with large amount of flexible activation parameters.\n\nTo our knowledge, given a sufficient number of units, a well-designed activation functions can approximate the models with other activation functions to any level of accuracy, which is referred to as universal approximation theorem. Therefore, even a good activation function cannot outperform other ones in any settings of hyper-parameter and model architecture, but some of them are good at handling a particular set of learning tasks with certain model architectures. In addition, training algorithms can also make a difference and have some interactions with the selection of activation functions. We believe we proposed a family of promising flexible activation functions and we will further study them. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "COMBINED FLEXIBLE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Renlong Jie", "Junbin Gao", "Andrey Vasnev", "Minh-Ngoc Tran"], "authorids": ["renlong.jie@sydney.edu.au", "junbin.gao@sydney.edu.au", "andrey.vasnev@sydney.edu.au", "minh-ngoc.tran@sydney.edu.au"], "keywords": ["Flexible", "Activation Functions", "Deep Learning", "Regularization"], "abstract": "Activation in deep neural networks is fundamental to achieving non-linear mappings.

We would like to address your comments as below:\n(1)\tComparison with neural architecture search: For the paper of searched activation functions (Ramachandran et al. 2017), they actually proposed a function with unbounded domain searched empirically with reinforcement learning, which can be applied to replace ReLu. It is a specific form rather than a general form, and cannot be used to replace sigmoid or tanh, whose output are bounded. Even though they used large datasets and large models with tremendous computing power in Google Brain, their experimental results are not significant with only 5 runs for each setting, while we do at least 50 runs and provide the standard error of the sample means for testing the significances. Therefore, we do not think they proposed a better activation function or method than ours. \n(2)\tNon-standard benchmark: We are facing the dilemma of choosing large models and doing more trials for testing the significances. Please be aware that in a lot of scenarios in practice, such as edge computing, we prefer small models. The results for the first experiment in forecasting national stock indices is definitely significant if we are using stacked LSTMs. Further experiments have shown that the performances of models with flexible activation functions surpass that with standard sigmoid for both G7 and G20 countries without randomly choosing the subset.  In the second experiment, we achieved even quite significant improvement over ReLu and significant improvement over PRelu in a large proportion of cases. \n(3)\tMore hyper-parameters: It is shown in the experiments that even without regularization, the two newly proposed activation functions can achieve significantly better results than Sigmoid and ReLu for muti-variate time series prediction and image compression. Thus, we did not introduced extra hyper-parameters to achieve significant improvements.\n(4)\tBackprop formulation: As we proposed a general form of flexible activation function, it is natural to write down the back-propagation formula for this form to show the difference from backprop of weights and bias. In some related papers including the original paper of PRelu, they also provided the backprop formula.  In practice, for functions whose derivatives can not be calculated in Pytorch automatedly, we need to define their backward path manually by using this formula. \n(5)\tExplanation of principle 1: For Principle 1 in Section 2.1,  \u201csame domain\u201d means the component activation functions should have the same output domain as the baseline fixed activation functions. For example, when we want to use a flexible combination to replace sigmoid, we need to make sure that the outputs of all the component functions are between 0 and 1.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "COMBINED FLEXIBLE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Renlong Jie", "Junbin Gao", "Andrey Vasnev", "Minh-Ngoc Tran"], "authorids": ["renlong.jie@sydney.edu.au", "junbin.gao@sydney.edu.au", "andrey.vasnev@sydney.edu.au", "minh-ngoc.tran@sydney.edu.au"], "keywords": ["Flexible", "Activation Functions", "Deep Learning", "Regularization"], "abstract": "Activation in deep neural networks is fundamental to achieving non-linear mappings.

For example, https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941 (Searching for Activation Functions). I don't know what the advantage of this approach compared to searched activation. I guess it's less computation heavy and maybe better motivated. But at least the author should give some pros/cons. (2) the paper has two benchmark, stock price prediction and CIFAR-10. I don't understand why as arch paper, it use such non standard benchmark (stock) and non standard arch (LeNet?). I don't think based these benchmark we can make solid conclusion. (3) These model seems introduce quite a bit more hyper-parameters. It's unclear if it is better than tuning other architecture e.g., batch norm/layer norm/dropout or even just optimizer. For example, \"flexible is 0.032\" does this parameter generalize to other dataset? Like if the gain is really significant, like resnet over AlexNet, hyperparam doesn't matter. But if it's marginal win over a weak baseline, the how to get the results is important.\n\nSome comments:\nIn section 2, \" back propagation of these activation parameters by stochastic gradient descent can be\ndone as follows\"\nWhy we need to list the detail backprop formulation here?

In each piece of input space, it takes the affine function with the largest output value, which lead to a convex piece-wise function that can be used to approximate any convex functions. \n-\tIn the original paper (Yang et al. 2018), they model the context and the conditional next-token distribution as a softmax function, while the context vector h and word embedding w depend on the input next tokens and context with learnable parameters, which can increase the model capacity to be more adaptive to high rank language models with non-linear properties. We will try to improve the expression in the updated version.\n-\tI think we have already used \u201cdeep auto-encoder based on neural networks\u201d and \u201cfully connected auto-encoder\u201d in the first paragraph of section 3.2, but shorten it to \u201cauto-encoder\u201d in later context to reduce the length of the paper. The \u201cauto-encoder\u201d in the abstract has been changed to \u201cfully connected auto-encoder\u201d in the updated version.\nb.\tMethodology\n-\tWe will update the notation \u201ca\u201d in the equations to \u201cf\u201d.\nc.\tExperiments\n-\tIn our experiments, we find that in all architectures of multi-layer LSTM being tested, the newly proposed flexible sigmodal activation and its regularized version achieves an improvement, and most of them are statistically significant. As we know, in general the goodness of activation function depends on the learning tasks and the model architectures. Even PRelu cannot outperform the baseline models with Relu in all image classification tasks with CNNs. Thus we think if it can provide a significant improvement for a proportion of tasks and architectures, we can consider it as a discrete hyper-parameter in a list with other promising baseline activation functions, which is much more computational efficient than trying a new architecture with hyper-parameter optimization from scratch. \n-\tWe know that LeNet-5 is a relatively small model that does not provide competitive results on CIFAR-10. However, considering our limited computational resources, it seems to be computational expensive and time consuming to train large models such as Resnet for a relatively large number of times for hyper-parameter optimization and statistical test. We find most related study on flexible activation functions only perform 5-10 runs without statistical test.\nd.\tCode\n-\tWe define an independent function with backward path considering the possibility for introducing non-differentiable components into our flexible activation functions. In fact, the newly proposed flexible sigmodal activation involves a piecewise function, whose derivative may not be calculated with pytorch.\n-\tWe will try to make more explanation for the experimental details in the updated version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "COMBINED FLEXIBLE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Renlong Jie", "Junbin Gao", "Andrey Vasnev", "Minh-Ngoc Tran"], "authorids": ["renlong.jie@sydney.edu.au", "junbin.gao@sydney.edu.au", "andrey.vasnev@sydney.edu.au", "minh-ngoc.tran@sydney.edu.au"], "keywords": ["Flexible", "Activation Functions", "Deep Learning", "Regularization"], "abstract": "Activation in deep neural networks is fundamental to achieving non-linear mappings.

We will use the newly proposed sigmodal function rather than sigmoid as the activation in LSTMs for any multi-variate time series forecasting tasks. As we know, most newly proposed unbounded activation functions (flexible or not) cannot outperform ReLu by more than 0.5% in terms of test accuracy in a large range of image classification tasks. \n-\tIn the second experiment, the improvement is quite significant from the baseline ReLu activation. Even though in some cases it can be outperformed by PReLu, we can still consider the choice between them as a hyper-parameter to be selected. The original study on PReLu did not mention its advantage in image compression with densely connected Auto-encoder. In addition, the experiment also demonstrates that the goodness of different activation functions may depend on the layer where we put them.\n-\tWe use LeNet-5 since we hope to make statistical test with a relatively large number of trials. In fact, we find that most related studies only perform 5 or 10 trials without testing the statistical significance or giving the error bars for each time step. Models like ResNet and DenseNet can provide better validation/test accuracies on CIFAR10, but they require much more computational power for training while still outperformed by the current SOTA achieved by NAS. Therefore, we did not use these large models for testing the significance as we are not focusing on computer vision tasks.\n-\tWe do not agree with your conclusion that we are simply proposing another activation function showing little to no improvement. Actually, we proposed a family of activation functions with a general form that can be introduced for both bounded and unbounded domains, which is highly extendable. In the first experiment, the discrepancy is small but with statistical significance. As we know, it is probably the first flexible sigmodal activation function introduced to LSTM. In the second experiment, the result is significant and the discrepancy is relatively large, which can improve the performances of densely connected auto-encoder networks without changing the architectures.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "COMBINED FLEXIBLE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Renlong Jie", "Junbin Gao", "Andrey Vasnev", "Minh-Ngoc Tran"], "authorids": ["renlong.jie@sydney.edu.au", "junbin.gao@sydney.edu.au", "andrey.vasnev@sydney.edu.au", "minh-ngoc.tran@sydney.edu.au"], "keywords": ["Flexible", "Activation Functions", "Deep Learning", "Regularization"], "abstract": "Activation in deep neural networks is fundamental to achieving non-linear mappings.

I would really like to see the kind of carefully baselined, ablated, and hyperparameter-tuned results that would justify adding the techniques introduced to the toolbox of a typical deep learning practitioner.\n\nSome feedback:\n\nTypos:\n- The formatting is off a bit (shifted horizontally?)\n- In the abstract: RPeLu -> PReLU\n- p. 5: \"basement settings\"->baseline, \"logarithmic sale\"->scale\n- p. 6: basement->baseline again\n- p. 7 etc.: trail->trial\n\nFeedback:\n- Intro:\n  - Explain why maxout is similar to training piecewise activation functions?\n  - It's unclear what \"making the most of the non-linear properties by introducing adaptation policy on the input\" means\n  - An \"autoencoder\" is not an architecture as much as a broad family of architectures coupled with training approaches (I'm guessing you mean a fully-connected autoencoder)\n- Methodology:\n  - consider using \"f\" instead of \"a\" so it's easier to tell apart from alpha?\n- Experiments:\n  - I'm not sure I'm convinced by the statistical tests used on the LSTM results; they demonstrate that your approach, with a few specific sets of hyperparameter settings, does better than the baseline, but not that this represents a valid claim about your activation function's effect on this LSTM model in general.\n  - The autoencoder experiments are even less convincing, in that they represent two seemingly arbitrary network architectures, with equally arbitrary placement of the activation function in one of them.\n  - The regularization experiments use LeNet-5, which is not a compelling benchmark architecture with respect to contemporary practice. The effects of regularization techniques can be very different in different regimes of dataset and network size.\n- Code:\n  - I'm not sure why you performed backprop by hand for your activation functions and used torch.Function, rather than writing them directly as nn.Modules that make use of PyTorch autograd\n  - There are lots of details in the code that aren't in the paper; in general, papers should aim to be relatively self-contained (although I'm very glad to see your code, and it's pretty simple to follow)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1409/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "COMBINED FLEXIBLE ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Renlong Jie", "Junbin Gao", "Andrey Vasnev", "Minh-Ngoc Tran"], "authorids": ["renlong.jie@sydney.edu.au", "junbin.gao@sydney.edu.au", "andrey.vasnev@sydney.edu.au", "minh-ngoc.tran@sydney.edu.au"], "keywords": ["Flexible", "Activation Functions", "Deep Learning", "Regularization"], "abstract": "Activation in deep neural networks is fundamental to achieving non-linear mappings. Traditional studies mainly focus on finding fixed activations for a particular set of learning tasks or model architectures. The research on flexible activation is quite limited in both designing philosophy and application scenarios. In this study, we propose a general combined form of flexible activation functions as well as three principles of choosing flexible activation component. Based on this, we develop two novel flexible activation functions that can be implemented in LSTM cells and auto-encoder layers. Also two new regularisation terms based on assumptions as prior knowledge are proposed. We find that LSTM and auto-encoder models with proposed flexible activations provides significant improvements on time series forecasting and image compressing tasks, while layer-wise regularization can improve the performance of CNN (LeNet-5) models with RPeLu activation in image classification tasks.", "pdf": "/pdf/7ec95c63b73a04a810e869813edcae63688b8b3d.pdf", "code": "https://github.com/9NXJRDDRQK/Flexible_Activation", "paperhash": "jie|combined_flexible_activation_functions_for_deep_neural_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/a523231fc777039d12b7c519a1ffe78a5350dc75.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\njie2020combined,\ntitle={{\\{}COMBINED{\\}} {\\{}FLEXIBLE{\\}} {\\{}ACTIVATION{\\}} {\\{}FUNCTIONS{\\}} {\\{}FOR{\\}} {\\{}DEEP{\\}} {\\{}NEURAL{\\}} {\\{}NETWORKS{\\}}},\nauthor={Renlong Jie and Junbin Gao and Andrey Vasnev and Minh-Ngoc Tran},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lh6C4FDr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
