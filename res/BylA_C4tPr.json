In the revised version of the paper, we have added an additional table (Table 1 in the revised version) to clearly demarcate how our methods differ from R-GCN in terms of its applicability and parameter complexity. We have also added additional explanations to make the differences more explicit.\n\n2. Learning relation embeddings along with node embeddings provide an advantage especially for tasks that utilize relation embeddings. For instance, in link prediction, prior approaches use GCN models only for obtaining entity embeddings while representation for relation is defined as a separate parameter. Through our experiments, we have shown that if GCN models provide both entity and relation embeddings then it is more effective than such approaches. The goal of learning relation embeddings is not just to solve the over-parameterization problem but to also provide the model with a rich representation for relations and to extend GCN models for tasks where relation embeddings are required. In Table 1 (revised version) we show how learning relation embeddings affect parameter complexity compared to other methods that consider relations. \n\n3. Thanks for pointing this out. We have included a description of each dataset in the appendix. Also, we have provided details about the loss function and the readout operation used for obtaining graph-level representation in the revised version of the paper. \n\n4. In Table 2 (submitted version), all the results except for our proposed method and ConvKB are taken from previous papers. So the missing values are indicated with \u2018-\u2019. We have made this explicit in the revised version.\n\n5. As requested by the reviewer, in the revised version of the paper, we have included two new results (Figures 4 and 5) and have extended our discussion on the scalability of CompGCN in Section 6.3 of the paper. Also, we have included an additional table (Table 1) which shows how our method differs from previous methods in terms of parameter complexity. We hope that these additional results and discussion have satisfied the queries of the reviewer."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1230/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1230/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Composition-based Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks", "authors": ["Shikhar Vashishth", "Soumya Sanyal", "Vikram Nitin", "Partha Talukdar"], "authorids": ["shikhar@iisc.ac.in", "sanyal.soumya8@gmail.com", "vikram.nitin@columbia.edu", "ppt@iisc.ac.in"], "keywords": ["Graph Convolutional Networks", "Multi-relational Graphs", "Knowledge Graph Embeddings", "Link Prediction"], "TL;DR": "A Composition-based Graph Convolutional framework for multi-relational graphs.", "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been shown to be quite successful in modeling graph-structured data.

In comparison with existing multi-relational GCN, CompGCN leverages insights from knowledge graph embedding and learns representations of both nodes and relations, with the aim to alleviate the problem of over-parameterization. Moreover, to improve the scalability w.r.t. the number of relations, the initial relation representations are expressed as a linear combination of a fixed number of basis vectors. In contrast to existing works, the basis vectors are only defined for initialization but not for every GCN layer. The authors also compared the proposed CompGCN with other existing GCN variants and summarized the relationships between CompGCN and other models. In the experiments, three tasks including link prediction, node classification and graph classification were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. By comparing with existing methods, the effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated.\n\nThere are several concerns on this paper. First, this work is somewhat incremental on R-GCN (\"Modeling relational data with graph convolutional networks\"). Although the differences were highlighted, the overall technical contribution is limited. In this paper, relation representations are learned jointly with node representations, but it is not clear on what are the benefits by doing so, or how significant the over-parameterization problem can be alleviated in this manner. Second, the experimental setup is unclear. As for the datasets, some more descriptions about the meaning of relationships and labels should be provided. As for the three different tasks, what loss functions were used for model training, how to obtain graph-level representations from node-level representations for graph classification, should be clarified. Third, in Table 2, there are some missing values of some compared methods, but it is not clear on their absence. Finally, from the results of Figure 3, it is hard to see the scalability of the proposed method w.r.t. the increasing number of relations since the variable is the number of basis. It is suggested to provide some more results to show the insights of advantages of the proposed method, such as the accuracy change w.r.t. increasing number of relations and the corresponding running time, in comparison with other methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1230/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1230/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Composition-based Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks", "authors": ["Shikhar Vashishth", "Soumya Sanyal", "Vikram Nitin", "Partha Talukdar"], "authorids": ["shikhar@iisc.ac.in", "sanyal.soumya8@gmail.com", "vikram.nitin@columbia.edu", "ppt@iisc.ac.in"], "keywords": ["Graph Convolutional Networks", "Multi-relational Graphs", "Knowledge Graph Embeddings", "Link Prediction"], "TL;DR": "A Composition-based Graph Convolutional framework for multi-relational graphs.", "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been shown to be quite successful in modeling graph-structured data.
