Instead for each node being represented by the best linear fit of the corresponding sub-space, it is represented by the best sub-cube. The idea is valid if not extremely original. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure it has too many applications, though. I think it is more frequent to encounter raw data residing some Euclidean space, while using the Hamming space for representation (e.g., as in various similarity-preserving hashing techniques). Hence, I believe a more interesting setting would be to have W in R^d, while keeping Z in H^K, i.e., the dictionary atoms are real vectors producing best linear fit of corresponding clusters with binary activation coefficients. This will lead to the construction of a hash function. The out-of-sample extension would happen naturally through representation pursuit (which will now be performed over the cube).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n1.\tA very simple and easy to implement idea extending tree dictionaries to binary data\r\n2.\tFor binary data, it seems to outperform other algorithms in the presented recovery experiment. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe paper reads more like a preliminary writeup rather than a real paper. The length might be proportional to its contribution, but fixing typos and putting a conclusion section wouldn\u2019t harm.\r\n2.\tThe experimental result is convincing, but it\u2019s rather andecdotal. I might miss something, but the author should argue convincingly that representing binary data with sparse tree-structured dictionary is interesting at all, showing a few real applications. The presented experiment on binarized MNIST digit is very artificial."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Tree structured sparse coding on cubes", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "A brief description of tree structured sparse coding on the binary cube.", "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3590", "paperhash": "szlam|tree_structured_sparse_coding_on_cubes", "authors": ["Arthur Szlam"], "authorids": ["aszlam@ccny.cuny.edu"], "keywords": [], "conflicts": []}, "tags": [], "invitation": {}}}, {"ddate": null, "legacy_migration": true, "tmdate": 1362001920000, "tcdate": 1362001920000, "number": 2, "id": "7ESq7YWfqMhHk", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2013/-/submission/review", "forum": "rtGYtZ-ZKSMzk", "replyto": "rtGYtZ-ZKSMzk", "signatures": ["anonymous reviewer 2f02"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["anonymous"], "content": {"title": "review of Tree structured sparse coding on cubes", "review": "summary:\r\nThis is a 3-page abstract only. It proposes a low-dimensional representation of data in order\r\nto impose a tree structure. It relates to other mixed-norm approaches previously proposed in\r\nthe literature. Experiments on a binarized MNIST show how it becomes robust to added noise.\r\n\r\nreview:\r\nI must say I found the abstract very hard to read and would have preferred a longer version\r\nto better understand how the model is different from prior work. It's not clear for instance\r\nhow the proposed approach compares to other denoising methods. It's not clear neither what is\r\nthe relation between tree-based decomposition and noise in MNIST. Finally, I didn't understand\r\nwhy the model was restricted to binary representations.
