I however, share the concerns outlined by the reviewers in their first (and only) set of comments, and invite the authors to take particular heed of the points made by AnonReviewer3, although all make excellent points.

Showing that a formula is a tautology is important because if we can classify a formula A -> B as a tautology then we can say that B is a logical consequence of A. The structure of the formula is a feedforward neural network built in a top-down manner. The leaves of this network are vectors (each of them represents a particular occurrence of an atom) which, after the construction of the formula, are processed by some recurrent neural networks.\n\nThe proposed approach seems interesting. However, my main doubt concerns the model. It seems to outperform the state-of-the-art, but the authors do not give any explanations why. There is no theoretical or intuitive explanation of why the model works. Why we need RNNs and not feedforward NNs? I think this is an big issue.\nIn conclusion, I think that the paper is a bit borderline. The model should be better explained.

The key feature of the model is that it gathers information about a given formula by traversing its parse tree top-down. One neural net of the model traverses the parse tree of the formula from the root all the down toward the leaves, and generates vectors for the leaves of the tree. Then, another RNN-based neural net collects these generated vectors, and answers a query asked for the formula, such as logical entailment. When experimented with Evans et al.'s data set for logical entailment queries, the authors' model outperforms existing models that encode formulae by traversing their parse trees bottom-up.\n\nI found the idea of traversing a parse tree of a formula top-down and converting it to a vector very interesting. It is also good to know that the idea leads to a competitive model for at least one dataset. \n\nHowever, I am hesitant to be a strong supporter for this paper. I feel that the cons and pros of the model and its design decisions are not fully analyzed or explained in the paper; when reading this paper, I wanted to learn a rule of thumb for deciding when (and why if so) a top-down model of logical formulae works better than a bottom-up model. I understand that what I ask for is very difficult to answer, but experiments with more datasets and different types of queries (such as satisfiability) might have made me happier.\n\nHere are some minor comments.\n\n* Abstract: I couldn't quite understand your point about atoms.

In particular, it improves by 10% absolute over the special-purpose and highly performant PossibleWorldNet on the most difficult category of problems, the \u2018massive\u2019 category, achieving 83.6% accuracy.\n\nPro/Con mix\n\n7.\tAlthough the paper did not provide much insight into what was going on in the network to allow it to perform well (point 1 in \u2018Cons\u2019), I was able to convince myself I could understand a way the architecture *could* succeed (whether this possible approach matches the actual processing in the model I have no way of assessing). In brief, the vector that is passed down the network can be thought of as a list of truth values across multiple possible worlds of the tree node at which the vector resides. To search for a counterexample to tautologicalhood, the original input vector to the root node could be the zero (false) vector. If the kth value in the vector at a parent node labeled \u2018or\u2019 is 0 (the disjunction is false in world k) then in the two children the kth value must also be 0. If the kth value of the vector at an XOR node is 0, the kth value of the two children must both be 0 or both be 1; actually these values need not reside in position k so the children could both have value 0 at some position i and both have value 1 at another position j. Then in the RNN-Var component of the network, which checks for consistency across multiple tokens of the same proposition variable, each position k in all vectors for the same variable can be checked for equality, producing a value 1 in the output vector if all have value 1, producing 0 if all have value 0, and producing value -1 if the values do not all agree. Then RNN-All checks across all vectors for proposition variable types to see if there\u2019s a position k in which no value -1 occurs; if so, the values of the variable vectors at position k give the truth values for all variables such that the overall proposition has the desired value 0: a counterexample exists. If no such position k exists, the proposition is a tautology.
