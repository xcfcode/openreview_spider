However, Adaptive $l_c$ and $\\|\\vec{l_a}\\|$ could be applied to other general actor-critic methods, which expands the implications of our contribution.\n\nFor the existing optimizers, AdaGrad decreases the learning rate monotonically and performs larger updates for more sparse parameters. AdaDelta and RMSprop adjust AdaGrad to make the learning rate decreasing not too aggressive. They all reduce the learning rate along the training based only on the pattern of gradients, without considering the convergence of Q-value and the improvement of policies. AdaMa updates the vector of learning rates of all actors towards the direction of maximizing the $Q$ value the most. Moreover, in a single-agent setting, existing optimizers independently work on the actor and the critic, without considering the relation between them. Adaptive $l_c$ and $\\|\\vec{l_a}\\|$ dynamically balances the learning rates between the critic and actor according to their varying effects on the overall learning in order to speed up the learning and avoid the performance breakdown.\n\nIn Dec-POMDP, the agents could only obtain the partial observation of the global state and make decisions based on the partial observation.

It proposes AdaMa, an algorithm which balances the learning rates of actors and the critic, and can also make use of the second-order information. Experiments show that AdaMa can learn agents faster. \n\n\n---\nWriting Quality\n\nThe paper is not well-written as I don't fully understand it. Notations are used without definition ($\\delta$ in Section 3.3) and inconsistent (some $Q$ has arrow above it and some doesn't) , and $\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial \\theta}$ has a confusing shape. Simpler symbols can also be used for readability (e.g., $\\widehat{\\|\\overrightarrow{l_a}\\|}$ can be replaced by something like $\\eta_a$). The derivation of $\\Delta Q$ can be deferred to appendix. \n\nI'd suggest the authors to make an algorithm box for the full algorithm. Equation (1), (2) and (3) might be confusing, as they're describing algorithms, not mathematical equations. \n\n\n---\nComments\n\n\nI'm not fully convinced. The figures indeed show that AdaMa uses different LR for different actor. Why is this helpful? Why should we slow down the learning of an actor if it's already good? \n\nHow does Adam, one of the most widely used optimizer, work?

The topic and idea of using adaptive learning rates to avoid hand-tuning are quite interesting and important. I think the related topics are worth investigating.\n2.

I think more experiments on larger scale tasks are needed to make the effectiveness of the proposed method convincing.\n2. Using first- and second-order Taylor expansion to obtain the best possible learning rates seems to be a reasonable idea. However, I think some more rigorous theoretical understanding is worth pursuing to show the benefits of the proposed method in a more convincing way, e.g., the speed of convergence for fixed and adaptive learning rate methods.\n\nOverall, I found the problem and the idea important and interesting.
