In this work, authors show convincing results indicating that this is due to a lack of consistency between the main classification loss (typically soft-max cross entropy) and the selected geometric constraint. Consequently, they propose a simple approach where the softmax loss is replaced by a validation loss that is consistent with the enforced geometry. Specifically, for each training batch, instead of considering a join loss (soft-max cross entropy + geometric constraint), they apply a sequential process, where each training batch is split into two sub-batches: a first batch used to apply the geometric constraint, and a second batch (based on the proposed feature geometry) where a validation loss is used to generate a predicted label distribution. Authors test the proposed idea using an implementation that enforces that samples from each class belong to an independent low-rank sub-space (enforced geometric constraint). Results verify the main hypothesis. Specifically, the resulting model is able to fit real data but not data with random labels. The strength of this evaluation is enhanced including results from relevant baselines. In terms of generalization of real data, the proposed approach offers a small increase in accuracy.\n\nPaper is well written, main hypothesis is relevant, and results are convincing. While not a complete answer to the main questions related to the abilities of DNNs to fit and generalize on real data, this paper offers relevant insights related to the role of finding/using a suitable loss function to train DNNs.

The paper turns to Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding (OLE) loss for the geometric constraint that one class of data/feature are assumed to reside on a low-rank subspace that subspaces of different classes are orthogonal ideally. The probability in the softmax is then modeled as cosine similarity between data feature and the class-specific subspaces. In this way, geometric loss and softmax loss have the common goal for optimization. Moreover, during training, the geometry enforced on one batch of features is simultaneously validated on a separate batch using a validation loss. The experiments seem to suggest such a model helps avoid overfitting/memorizing noisy training data. The paper reads well and is easy to follow.\n\nHowever, the paper is limited in technical novelty and practical significance. Here are some concerns -- \n\n1) The paper only studies one method based on OLE, though it cites the center loss [19]. How does the center loss behave in face of noisy training label? Would it also be able to refuse to fit the noisy training data?\n\n2) As each class has its own (low-rank) subspace, and the rank is reduced by imposing the nuclear norm. It seems that the proposed method is hard to extend to many classes (class number is larger than the dimension)?\n\n3) The datasets in the experiments are quite small in scale and class number. It is not persuasive unless tested on larger scale data or with large class number.\n\n4) The proposed method seems to be limited in deal with discrete labels (e.g., classification), is it easy to extend to continuous target, say regression problems like depth estimation and surface normal estimation?\n\n5) While the authors claim as a main contribution that the proposed GRSVNet is a general framework, it is hard to see how this framework can be used in other tasks other than classification.\n\n6) The experiments are less persuasive. It's better to add the error bar to see the improvement by the proposed method is not due to random initialization.
