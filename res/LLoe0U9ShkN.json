Instead of factorizing the inducing points The global inducing input $Z_0$ is propagated through the network to ensure posterior dependencies across layers. The authors also extend this idea to deep Gaussian processes so that the latent functions across layers are correlated. Experiments show better performance than previous methods on both synthetic and real datasets, without the need to anneal the weights for the KL term in ELBO.\n\nPros:\nThe idea of capturing the posterior dependencies between layers in BNN and DGP is great, and may have a good amount of significance in both areas.\n\nCons:\nThe description of the method itself is not very clear. For the BNN part, while Alg. 1 is easy to follow, how does it relates to the training process of BNN? The DGP part is even harder to understand -- what is the complete form of the variational distribution and the ELBO? How is the ELBO optimized? The paper didn't say much about these important details, and by just staring at Eq. (16) I really couldn't figure them out. Comparing to methods the paper compares with such as (Salimbeni and Deisenroth, 2017), Section 3 of this paper is not clearly written.\n\nOther questions:\n\nHow does $N_{l-1}$ in Eq. (2) disappear in Eq. (14)?\n\nDoes this method apply to GP classification?\n\nIn Sec. 4.1, 100 inducing points per layer was used on a dataset with only 40 points. What if the number of inducing points is smaller? Does the proposed method still work as expected?\n\n\n-----------------------\n\nI thank the authors for their detailed reply.

(2018) and Matthews et al. (2018) were a huge inspiration for this work.  In particular, the posterior over the lower layers in these models is actually equal to the prior (Hron et al. 2020 \"Exact posterior distributions of wide Bayesian neural networks\"),  with the top-layer posterior being in effect Bayesian linear regression.  This was interesting from the perspective of variational inference, because if the approximate posterior equals the prior for the lower layers, then the KL-divergence to the prior for those layers is 0 and as the ELBO can be written as $ELBO = E[log P(y|x, w) - D_{KL}(Q(W)|| P(W))]$, we can have arbitrarily deep networks without hurting the ELBO.  This doesn't happen in standard factorised networks: the approximate posterior and prior are different at all layers, implying that (all else being equal) the ELBO should get worse as the network gets deeper.  To obtain an approximate posterior over the top layer which gave good performance despite the lower layers being drawn at random from the prior, we found that we needed to use the optimal top-layer posterior, which corresponded to the global inducing posterior.\n\nAn investigation of the degree and performance implications of heavy-tailed behaviour in the activities of variational Bayesian neural networks with different approximate posteriors would be exciting follow-up work.  We speculate that:\n* following Vladimirova et al. (2019), the activities of neurons in a factorised network become more heavy-tailed with depth, and\n* the design of our approximate posterior might actually suppress heavy-tailed activations.  In particular, at each layer, we sample the weights by in effect conditioning on the outputs being close to some target.  That conditioning uses a Gaussian likelihood which may well encourage the activations to be more Gaussian and less heavy-tailed.\nIt would be interesting to investigate whether these differences in heavy-tailed behaviour might be one way to understand the performance differences between global inducing and factorised methods.\n\nThank you for pointing out the spelling/grammatical errors!

The difference from the previous approaches is to use global inducing points which help to take into account correlations across layers. \n\nI find a paper well written and the results worth publishing. \n\n**Comments**:\n\u201cWe found that the ELBO for methods that factorise across layers \u2014 factorised and local inducing \u2014 drops rapidly as networks get deeper and wider (Fig. 2). This is undesirable behaviour, as we know that wide, deep networks are necessary for good performance on difficult machine learning tasks. In contrast, we found that methods with global inducing points at the last layer decay much more slowly with depth, and perform better as networks get wider.\u201d I wonder if it can be due to the increasing tails with depth in BNNs with Gaussian prior as stated by Vladimirova et al. (2019). According to their paper, the distributions on the units across the layers become heavier-tailed but knowing that the limit is Gaussian Process (Matthews et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018), the distributions on the units for wider neural networks are closer to Gaussians (I think the center of the distribution reminds the Gaussian more and more). And as the methods that factorise across the layers use the assumptions of Gaussian units, the error is higher for shallow NNs. So maybe it is possible to keep in mind the \u201cheaviness\u201d for shallow NNs induces due to the correlations between the units and to improve the results. \n\nLee et al.

The paper begins by pointing out that, for any posterior distribution approximation, the optimal conditional posterior distribution over the top-layer weights given the weights of the previous layers has a closed-form in the case of Gaussian likelihood, which, due to Bayes rule, turns out to be product of the likelihood and the top-layer prior. Based on this insight the paper proposes to model each conditional posterior distribution over intermediate layers weights given previous layers weights following the same structure, that is, as a product of a 'pseudo-likelihood' over unobserved noisy activations and the prior for that layer. In order to make inference tractable, the paper proposes the use of global inducing points as well as noisy pseudo-observations of the activations of intermediate layers which are treated as variational parameters.  The paper also describes how such procedure applies to convolutional neural networks and how it can be applied for DGPs as well.\n\nEven though the paper covers several topics, its presentation is clear and straightforward. The main issue I see with the paper is that the validation of the proposed model is done mostly in terms of accuracy and log-likelihood. As pointed out by [1], one of the main interests on posterior approximations that allow correlations between the weights is for capturing the uncertainty of the compositional structure. Based on this, I think the paper could increase its strength by describing the advantages on interpretability of the learned approximate posterior provides over a fully independent posterior approximation such as [2]. In particular, it would be useful to see how the conditional posterior distributions evolve given the previous layers weights.\n\n[1] Ivan Ustyuzhaninov, Ieva Kazlauskaite, Markus Kaiser, Erik Bodin, Neill DF Campbell, and Carl Hen-\nrik Ek.
