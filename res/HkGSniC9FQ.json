Thank you for comments. Actually, we considered one or more pre-trained neural network in the paper.\n\n2. Please pardon our non- scientific/mathematical tone that we just tried to emphasize of arrival of pre-trained neural network. \n\n3. Yes, in simple wording, it is the main claim of this paper. Many people intuitively think so, but so far no work solves this problem. On the other hand, according to our survey (the last second paragraph of Introduction), many empirical studies point out that pre-trained models are often harmful. That\u2019s the motivation of this work.\n\n4. As you mentioned, \u201cadding more features can be statistically problematic\u201d, while Reviewer 3 said \u201cthis is a very straight forward result \u2026 we can of course represent more objects\u201d. The different comments shows the experts do not have consensus in the effect of adding objects/features and that was the motivation of this work to study the conditions of performance improvement.\n\n5. Pre-trained components are useful and valuable, especially it is provided by reputable individuals or organizations, such as ResNet50 provided in Keras. We believe the pre-trained components will become popular soon. \nFurthermore, the performance of adopting pre-training is unclear in the literature. \nWe quote from some papers for the evidence that the performance of adopting pre-training is unclear:\nIn [1]: \u201d Even so, relatively little is known about the behavior of pretraining with datasets that are multiple orders of magnitude larger.\u201d\nIn [2]: \u201cthere remain open questions about the performance of pretrained distributed word representations and their interaction with weight initialization and other hyperparameters.\u201d\n\n6. The condition \u201clinearly independent\u201d is given to assure the result is theoretically sound, but as all we know that the output of several neural networks are hardly \u201clinearly dependent\u201d. So, the proposed theory is generally applicable to most neural networks.\n\n7. To generate convex hull from several vectors, the weights must be positive and summing to 1. The weights in Example 1 are not satisfying these two conditions. (In particular, \u201cw_1=3 and w_2=-1\u201d is not the convex combination.) Besides, the since the weights in a pre-trained model are frozen, we can see it as a black box or a function. That is why we denote x_1x_2 as f_3 and so on.\n\n8. In our pdf file, the X is shown as \u201cX = {(0, 0), (0 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)}\u201d. We have no idea why commas become semicolons. We apologize for all the other typos. We will correct them and also clarify the obscure statements.\n\n\nReference: \n[1] D. Mahajan, R. Girshick, V. Ramanathan, K. He, M. Paluri, Y. Li, A.

One is to benefit from other\u2019s intelligence and diligence, and the other is saving the efforts in data preparation and resources\nand time in training\"\n\nThe main results of the paper (Theorem 1,2,3) are of the following nature: if you use more features (i.e., \"components\") in the input of a network then you have \"more information\", and this cannot be bad. Here are the corresponding claims in the Abstract:\n\n\"we prove that a composite neural network, with high probability, performs better than any of its pre-trained components under certain assumptions.\"\n\n\"if an extra pre-trained component is added to a composite network, with high probability the overall performance will be improved.\"\n\nHowever, this argument seems to be just about expressiveness; adding more features can be statistically problematic. \n\nFurthermore, why is it specific to pre-trained components? Essentially the theorems are about adding any features.\n\nFinally, the assumption that the pre-trained components are linearly independent is invalid and the makes the whole analysis somewhat simplistic.\n\n\nThe motivating Example 1 just shows that the convex hull of a class of hypotheses can include more hypotheses than the class itself. I don't see any connection between this and the use of pre-training.\n\nOther examples unclear statements from the intro:\n\n\"One of distinctive features of the complicated applications is their applicable data sources are boundless. Consequently, their solutions need frequent revisions.\"\n\n\"Although neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions as close as possible (Hornik, 1991), the major reason for not existing such competent neural networks for those complicated applications is their problems are hardly fully understood and their applicable data sources cannot be identified all at once.\"\n\nThere are many typos in the paper including this one about X for the XOR function:\n\"Assume there is a set of locations indexed as X = {(0; 0); (0; 1); (1; 0); (1; 0)} with the corresponding values Y = (0; 1; 1; 0).
