The key idea is fitting a Q function to rewards, fitting another Q function to negative rewards, then estimating Q values using a linear combination of the two Q functions. The method is applied to DQN, double DQN, and on-policy actor-critic on the CartPole, Mountain Car, and Pendulum tasks in OpenAI Gym.\n\nThe writing isn't clear, especially in the introduction. Phrases like \"risky\", \"badness of a state\", and \"inverse policy\" are used without definition.\n\nThe experiments only test one value of \\lambda. Since \\lambda is the one hyperparameter that controls the degree to which the inverse rewards influence the Q value estimates, I think it is critical to test the performance of the proposed method under various values of \\lambda (e.g., by sweeping the unit interval in increments of 0.1).\n\nOne of the central claims is that the proposed Q value estimator gives more accurate estimates of returns than the estimators used in previous deep Q-learning methods. However, the experiments never compare the predicted Q values to the true values, as is done in [3].\n\nThe experiments only evaluate the proposed method on the CartPole, Mountain Car, and Pendulum tasks, which have very small action spaces. I suspect the benefit of the proposed method will be smaller in environments with a larger number of possible actions, since the inverse policy may fail to accurately estimate the values of actions that are neither the best nor the worst at any given time. \n\nOne of the central claims is that the proposed method improves the stability of Q-learning, but it is unclear how many random seeds were tested in Figure 2 and Table 2. It appears that only the data from one training run was used, and the reported standard deviations are computed using the last 10% of episodes in that single training run. Furthermore, the curves are smoothed using a moving average with a window size of 100 episodes. Together, these two details make it extremely difficult to evaluate the claim that the proposed algorithm is more stable, and also makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of the differences between the method's performance and the baselines. [1] shows how results on a small number of random seeds tend to not be reproducible.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.06560.pdf\n[2] http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/cjch.pdf\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper104/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hybrid Policies Using Inverse Rewards for Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "This paper puts forward a broad-spectrum improvement for reinforcement learning algorithms, which combines the policies using original rewards and inverse (negative) rewards.

The intuitive argument is that the values for the inverse problem clearly identify what actions should not be taken. Results are presented on OpenAI Gym problems in which the new method performed better than conventional methods. \n\nThe paper is not yet ready for publication for many reasons. First, the idea is not presented clearly, and it is not clear why it ever could be sensible. The inverse problem has a different solution than the base problem. Its solution would appear to have an arbitrary relationship to the base problem\u2019s solution. The two optimal policies may choose different actions, as suggested in the text, but this is not necessarily true; in some states the two policies may choose the same action. I don\u2019t see how anything can be said in general, and no significant theoretical results are presented. (They do prove a form of convergence on the inverse problem, but this is not a new result; the inverse problem is just another problem and needs no new result.)\n\nThe new hybrid method is never fully explained (e.g., the reader has to guess at what Q^H is). But by combining the solutions to the base and inverse problems in some way, it seems inevitable that the final optimal policy would be changed. Suppose the function approximation is completely successful and the correct values are exactly found. Then those for the base problem would give the optimal policy. Any alteration of them by the correct action-value function for the inverse problem could only make them worse and could only cause them to produce worse (or the same) behavior. There is no room for improvement and so this technique could only make things worse asymptotically if the function approximation is completely successful. This is the only thing that I see that can be clearly said about the new technique, and of course it is not a good thing.\n\nThere are results presented, but they are not well done; they provide no significant evidence for any conclusion. The methods are not completely presented, and the results seem to be for a single run, in which case any relative ordering of the methods could be obtained.\n\nGenerally, the paper is unfortunately poorly written.

It is not clear to me why the policy obtained from Q^- does better than Q^+. Theoretically, this should not happen: if we have the exact optimal Q function, Q^-, for <S, A, T, -R>, the policy defined by argmin_a Q^-(s, a) in every state s may be suboptimal in <S, A, T, R>. Is there a good conjecture/explanation for why the policy induced by Q^- works so well in 2(a) and (b)?\n\nThe authors chose to report the results using off-line training, which seem to favor their proposition.
