I maintain my review of this paper.\n\n# Main Idea\nThe main idea is that many networks learn shortcuts based on texture.  The authors propose to use anisotropic diffusion to augment training using images with suppressed texture.  This retains edge information without texture.  The authors claims to show that they achieve SOTA results on detection and classification in different datasets, and that their method is particularly effective for transfer learning tasks.\n\nThis work interpolates between work that tries to replace and resample texture and work that attempts to remove texture by focusing exclusively on edges with no other image content.  What is left after texture suppression is not just edges, but natural looking images with no discernible high frequency texture information (but high frequency edge information intact).  Color and low freqncy texture remains intact in these images.  In addition, shape information about the underlying natural objects is well preserved.  I think this is important because it has the effect suppressing specific high frequency texture while preserving low-frequency natural image statistics from within the training distribution.\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that the authors trained their networks with a combination of standard image net and their augmented version. Which means that the original texture information is still present in at least a part of the dataset.  The training set now contains the same edge and shape information with frequency-localized texture variation.\n\n# Interesting observations:\nInterestingly, when comparing to the original Geirhos Stylized ImageNet performance on MoCo V2, the method presented here significantly outperforms.\n### The authors note that: \nOne reason for this failure using the SIN dataset could be that the model is able to memorize the textures in the stylized images since it only has 79,434 styles. This is not a problem in the original fully-supervised setting where the authors used SIN for supervised image classification. In that case, the network can learn to ignore texture to discriminate between classes. \n\nThis points to the benefit of retaining some set of natural image statistics (from a larger distribution) within the training set.\n\nVery intriguingly, the presented method also outperforms a network trained on SIN when evaluated on sketch-image net, a dataset comprised almost entirely of edge-like sketch images lacking almost all texture.  I find this result to be the most surprising of all those presented as these image lack all natural image texture statistics.  The performance is not out of this world, but it outperforms training on native image net and on SIN.  It would be interesting to see the comparison of performance here to a network trained exclusively on image-net images with only the edges extracted (perhaps using canny edge detectors).\n\n# Weaknesses\nAvoid sentences like the following as they are not completely supported by the work. \"This forces the network to be less reliant on lower-level information to solve the pretext task and, hence, learn representations that focus on higher-level concepts.\u201d  \n\nSometimes the magnitude of differences in results between different methods (while being presented in tables as relatively modest improvements) are overstated in the text.  The results speak for themselves and there is no need to overstate small differences. \n\nI find the saliency maps unconvincing (both because they are only a cherry picked subset) and because attending to the entire object does not mean the network is not also attending to the object\u2019s texture.  Additionally, these methods are highly subjective in their evaluation (and likely to change depending on the method for saliency map production). Finally, the supplement shows examples that in fact don\u2019t follow the established pattern presented in the original paper.  Finally, the analysis and results of the paper do not depend on this result and as such I think you should just remove it.

Clarification for design choices and analysis. ", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful remarks. Following are our comments for the concerns raised : \n*  **\u201ctechnical novelty: the main contribution of the paper is proposing anisotropic diffusion as a way of data augmentation, which is somewhat trivial.\u201d** ---We feel, along with AnonReviewer4, that the simplicity of our approach is a significant virtue.  Many widely adopted methods (eg., SimCLR[5]) are simple but elegant. On the contrary, simplicity is the strength of the proposed approach because it promotes easy and rapid adoption by the community. The proposed approach aims at balancing the trade-off between suppressing texture while maintaining the important high-frequency information \u201cwithout a learning step\u201d and Anisotropic diffusion optimizes for the same. Previous approaches such as Stylized ImageNet based augmentations totally breaks down for self-supervised setup as the deep CNN models can memorize the 79,434 textures and use them to solve the self-supervised tasks (Section 4.1 main paper). Similarly, gaussian blurring which produced state-of-art-results on SSL[5], doesn\u2019t work well in supervised learning paradigms ( Table 4 main paper). Our approach works well in both cases because we strike the balance with the help of Anisotropic diffusion. \n* **\u201cThough it's quite simple, I feel it's quite heuristic and it's not supported by sufficient theoretical analysis or exploring of different design choices.\u201d:**  \nWe have shown the effects of different design choices for suppressing texture, in Table4, with the help of two different Anisotropic diffusion methods Perona Malik [1] and Michael Black [2]. Furthermore, we have also shown the effect of the number of diffusion iterations on the results in Table4. We have also shown comparisons with other classical texture suppression techniques such as bilateral filter and gaussian blur, and also the results of extreme bilateral+median filtering, referred to as cartoonized, in Table4. In all the comparisons, the proposed approach outperforms other approaches, which validates our choice for texture suppression against other similar approaches. \\\nA detailed theoretical analysis would involve modelling the effects of such processing on large-scale real-world data-distributions and its, even more complex, interplay with the learning algorithms. While both these questions are extremely important, they are still wide open problems, and much more theory is needed to be developed before we can build concrete theoretical models for the same. Meanwhile, the research community is trying to understand these complex phenomena with the help of empirical analysis, which is evident from a series of impactful work for analyzing the role of texture information [7][9][10]. Such a line of work eventually leads the way towards more rigorous theoretical frameworks. Our work also falls in the same category of methods and once again learned reviewer\u2019s concern about lack of theoretical analysis would deem all those impactful works unpublished. Lastly, our approach is based on Anisotropic diffusion principle, which is one of the better-understood frameworks for image processing and we hope that it inspires the community to take a deeper look into this direction to take us closer to a complete theoretical analysis. Therefore, we would request the reviewer to kindly re-consider their opinion around their concern for lack of theoretical analysis in light of the complexity of theoretical analysis and lack of such frameworks thereof.\n* **\u201cadditional analysis is needed to better demonstrate that the representation focuses less on texture.\u201d**:\nIn section 4.2.1, we have shown that our approach can reduce the reliance on texture information by experimenting with a recently introduced large-scale dataset, called Synthetic-DTD [3]. This dataset is created by taking 47 different textures from DTD dataset [4] and applying it to a 3D dataset of 10 classes, called ShapeNet [8] to yield the same object rendered with different view-points and multiple textures. Arguably, this dataset would pose extreme challenges to approaches that rely on texture specific information for classification. And, that\u2019s precisely what we observe in the form of 10.41% improvement of our proposed approach over the ResNet-50 baseline.\\\nWe took motivation from this observation and carried additional experimentation on a popular dataset, named Geirhos Style-Transfer (GST) dataset [7], which comprises 1248 images of 16 classes from ImageNet dataset with shape and texture coming from different classes. This dataset is aimed at teasing apart the importance of shape vs texture for deep CNNs. We observe an improvement of 1.02% on identifying the class representing the shape, over a pre-trained ResNet-50 on normal ImageNet. This experiment shows that we can successfully reduce the reliance on texture.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Visual Representations for Transfer Learning by Suppressing Texture", "authorids": ["~Shlok_Kumar_Mishra1", "~Anshul_Shah1", "~Ankan_Bansal1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Abhinav_Shrivastava2", "~Abhishek_Sharma4", "~David_Jacobs1"], "authors": ["Shlok Kumar Mishra", "Anshul Shah", "Ankan Bansal", "Jonghyun Choi", "Abhinav Shrivastava", "Abhishek Sharma", "David Jacobs"], "keywords": ["Suppressing Texture", "Transfer learning", "Self-Supervised Learning"], "abstract": "Recent works have shown that features obtained from supervised training of CNNs may over-emphasize texture rather than encoding high-level information.

The experiments are conducted on Sketch-ImageNet, where images have little texture. Therefore, augmentation by suppressing texture naturally has an advantage in such a setting.\u201d** : The transfer-learning settings are adopted from the widely followed contemporary standard protocol put forward in SimCLR[5]. Our results under this standard transfer-learning setting demonstrate consistent improvements or ~1% across 5 different real-world datasets, shown in Table2. In addition to this standard-setting, we have also experimented with Sketch-ImageNet to showcase the improvements (11.41% over ResNet-50 baseline) offered by our approach in an extreme texture-less setting. \n\n* **I am a bit skeptical about the proposed technique in a more general setup, such as learning from synthetic data. (synthetic data usually has a different texture than real imagery)**: We have never claimed that our proposed work can solve the problem of learning from synthetic data, however, this investigation could be a useful direction for future-work. We thank the reviewer for pointing it out.\n\n* **\u201cBesides, I think more baselines need to be added for transfer learning setting, such as techniques used in domain adaptation.\u201d:** We have followed the most popular contemporary setting for transfer-learning in our work. While, in theory we see some value to reviewers proposal of adding domain-adaptation baselines, practically, it\u2019s not possible to expect these many experiments in one work and we defer it for future work.\n\n[1]: Pietro Perona and Jitendra Malik.

Below we address the raised concerns:\n1) We have fixed the citation of the synthetic dataset which used  DTD for texture. We now refer to this dataset as synthetic-DTD dataset and have uploaded a new version of the paper which reflects this change.\n2) The DTD dataset of Table 2 is using the original DTD dataset (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/). We have followed the same convention as was done in SimCLR and reported the number on the first split in the DTD dataset. We have also added the state-of-the-art results from SimCLR in Table2 on all the datasets for which the authors had reported results. \n3) Apologies for the confusion.\n   a)  Yes, c is the same in equations 1 and 2. It is known as the diffusion coefficient and it controls the rate of the diffusion in the image. We can see that the value of c will be low near the edges due to the high gradient. Equation-1 intuitively ensures that regions with a lower value of c will see less smoothing. Similarly, at points where we have less gradient, the smoothing is large and hence texture is reduced between the edges.\n   b) In the original paper, in equation 2 we wanted to make the dependence of c on the gradient explicit. We have updated the equation and have made the definition of c consistent. We have reflected these changes in the newly uploaded version of the paper.  \n4) By \u201csupervised\u201d, we meant ImageNet pretrained backbone and fine-tuned on VOC for object detection. We have replaced \u201csupervised\u201d by \u201csupervised ImageNet\u201d in Table 1 to clarify this.   \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Visual Representations for Transfer Learning by Suppressing Texture", "authorids": ["~Shlok_Kumar_Mishra1", "~Anshul_Shah1", "~Ankan_Bansal1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Abhinav_Shrivastava2", "~Abhishek_Sharma4", "~David_Jacobs1"], "authors": ["Shlok Kumar Mishra", "Anshul Shah", "Ankan Bansal", "Jonghyun Choi", "Abhinav Shrivastava", "Abhishek Sharma", "David Jacobs"], "keywords": ["Suppressing Texture", "Transfer learning", "Self-Supervised Learning"], "abstract": "Recent works have shown that features obtained from supervised training of CNNs may over-emphasize texture rather than encoding high-level information.

The authors propose to suppress texture with anisotropic diffusion, as a way of data augmentation in training. The strategy is shown to be helpful for various downstream tasks, especially in a transfer learning setting.\n\nI believe the paper has several advantages:\n+ The proposed method is simple and well-motivated, and seems to provide consistent boosts across several settings.\n+ The paper is clearly presented, figure 1 provides a good summary of the paper.\n+ The visual analysis in sec 4.3 is quite interesting. The proposed technique is helpful in reducing the attention on texture in these examples.\n\nMeanwhile, I have several concerns:\n- technical novelty: the main contribution of the paper is proposing anisotropic diffusion as a way of data augmentation, which is somewhat trivial. Though it's quite simple, I feel it's quite heuristic and it's not supported by sufficient theoretical analysis or exploring of different design choices.\n- experimental analysis: I am happy to see that the proposed technique achieved improvements across different settings. However, I think additional analysis is needed to better demonstrate that the representation focuses less on texture. Additional experimental analysis can also help to better understand the proposed technique and gain further insights.\n- transfer learning: I am also not fully convinced by the effectiveness of the transfer learning setting. The experiments are conducted on Sketch-ImageNet, where images have little texture. Therefore, augmentation by suppressing texture naturally has an advantage in such a setting. I am a bit skeptical about the proposed technique in a more general setup, such as learning from synthetic data. (synthetic data usually has a different texture than real imagery). Besides, I think more baselines need to be added for transfer learning setting, such as techniques used in domain adaptation.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1845/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1845/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Visual Representations for Transfer Learning by Suppressing Texture", "authorids": ["~Shlok_Kumar_Mishra1", "~Anshul_Shah1", "~Ankan_Bansal1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Abhinav_Shrivastava2", "~Abhishek_Sharma4", "~David_Jacobs1"], "authors": ["Shlok Kumar Mishra", "Anshul Shah", "Ankan Bansal", "Jonghyun Choi", "Abhinav Shrivastava", "Abhishek Sharma", "David Jacobs"], "keywords": ["Suppressing Texture", "Transfer learning", "Self-Supervised Learning"], "abstract": "Recent works have shown that features obtained from supervised training of CNNs may over-emphasize texture rather than encoding high-level information.
