Based on this analysis, a linear convergence rate of the gradient descent for the squared loss is also shown. In addition, this paper empirically verifies the efficiency of the initialization of $\\tau = \\sqrt{L}^{-1}$ with/without batch normalization.\n\nContributions of the paper are summarized below:\n- Provides a sharp characterization of the largest scale of outputs of resblocks: $\\tau$.\n- Enlarges the class of ResNets with the global convergence guarantee of the gradient descent w.r.t. the scale of $\\tau$. (A related study [Allen-Zhu+2018b] focused on the scale of $\\tau = 1/L$).\n- Improve the depth dependence in the network width and the iteration complexity compared to existing studies.\n\nSignificance:\nTo theoretically justify the success of ResNets, this line of research is important, and I think this paper makes a certain contribution in this sense, although there seems to be much room for improvements regarding the depth dependence in the network width. (Unrealistically high over-parameterization: $m=n^8L^7$ is still required). In addition, a proposed technique (Theorem 1) to derive gradient bounds is surprising and beyond the intuition. Indeed, a simple way of using a natural spectral bound cannot explain the stability of ResNets with $\\tau=L^{-0.5}$.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well organized but there are some technical concerns as described below.\n\nQuality:\nI think the quality of the paper can be improved. \n- Maybe probabilities in some statements are not correct, for instance, a probability in Theorem 2 should depend on the value of $c$.\n- It is better to specify the value of $c$ in Theorem 1. It may take an arbitrary small value at the expense of the probability.\n- In the convergence analysis of the gradient descent (Theorem 5), the dependency on $\\tau$ should be mentioned. Is there no effect on the convergence rate by the choice of $\\tau$?\n\nMinor comments:\n- The network architecture is different from the standard ResNets. Usually, non-linear activation functions are applied after resblocks. Can theoretical analyses be extended to such a setting?\n- Initialization scales of parameters in related studies, as well as $\\tau$, should also be clarified for a fair comparison of $\\tau$.\n- In proofs, citations of theorems and lemmas seem incorrect, e.g., Theorem 1 may be used in the proof of Lemma 3 (and Theorem 3 too?) instead of Lemma 1.\n- Typo In Theorem 1: for all $a > l$  --> for all $b > a$ (?).\n- There is no definition of $h'_{i,l}$ in Lemma 4. Is it a perturbation of a hidden node h?\n\n-----\nUpdate: \nI thank the authors for the response and hard work.\nI would like to keep my score. Some concerns have been resolved.

The comments are addressed as follows.\n\nQuality:\n\n1. The probability in Theorem 2 should depend on the value of c.\nA: The factor of the probability depending on \u201cc\u201d is clearly spelled out in the proof. We update the paper with explicit dependence on c in theorem statements.\n\n2. It is better to specify the value of c in Theorem 1. It may take an arbitrary small value at the expense of the probability.\nA: We can set $c$ for a specific value for example $c=0.1$, which is sufficient for establishing the convergence theory in the downstream claims. Then Theorem 1 gives a condition on $m$ that $m >100(\\log L)$. \n\n3. In the convergence analysis of the gradient descent (Theorem 5), the dependency on $\\tau$ should be mentioned. Is there no effect on the convergence rate by the choice of tau?\nA: We want to clarify this as follows. 1) The convergence analysis in Theorem 5 does not depend on $\\tau$ explicitly since the gradient upper bound and lower bound are not tight enough to reflect the effect on the convergence rate by the choice of $\\tau$. 2) Our result already improves the convergence of ResNet, since it \u201creflects the value of $\\tau=1/\\sqrt{L}$ determines sharply the trainability\u201d. \n\nMinor comments:\n\nQ: The network architecture is different from the standard ResNets. Usually, non-linear activation functions are applied after resblocks. Can theoretical analyses be extended to such a setting?\nA: The non-linear activation location in the network architecture we studied is the same as that in the original ResNet paper (He et al. 2016). For the Preact ResNet, the residual block is the mapping $h_l = h_{l-1} +\\tau W_l \\sigma(h_{l-1})$. Our theoretical analysis carries over this setting without difficulty.\n\nQ: Initialization scales of parameters in related studies, as well as tau, should also be clarified for a fair comparison of tau.\nA: We take the usual He initialization $W_{i,j} \\sim N(0, 2/m)$, the same as related studies (Allen-Zhu et al., Du et al.). Hence the comparison is fair. The initialization of Fixup method is set as suggested in the original paper.\n\nQ: In proofs, citations of theorems and lemmas seem incorrect, e.g., Theorem 1 may be used in the proof of Lemma 3 (and Theorem 3 too?) instead of Lemma 1.\nA: Thanks for pointing out this. We have corrected the citation error.\n\nQ: Typo In Theorem 1: for all $a > l$ \uf0e0 for all $b>a$?.  No definition of $h\u2019_{i,l}$ in Lemma 4.\nA: Thanks for pointing out these. We correct the typo and add the definition of $h\u2019_{i,l}$.

The concerns are clarified as follows. \n1. Relation to Allen-Zhu et al. 2019 and Du et al. 2019.\nIndeed, there has been previous work studying the convergence of training ResNet, e.g., Allen-Zhu et al. 2019 and Du et al. 2019 and we study the same model as theirs. However, we give the full characterization for the convergence of training ResNet in terms of the values of $\\tau$, while previous work only builds a looser convergence for $\\tau<1/L$. Our result of stability for the case $\\tau<1/\\sqrt{L}$ is new and nontrivial, while in previous work the stability under condition $\\tau<1/L$ is obvious as a na\u00efve spectral norm bound applies. Furthermore, our theory characterization, i.e., value of $\\tau=1/\\sqrt{L}$ has nice practical guidance. \nIn short, our contribution is significant as it provides full characterization for the convergence of learning ResNet in theory and gives practical guidance on ResNet design by immediately connecting the theory to practice, while Allen-Zhu et al. does not.\n\n2. (1) The theorems should be stated more carefully. Some constant terms are hidden away in the Big-O and Big-Omega notations, e.g., in Theorem 2, the probability must have some dependency on \u201cc\u201d hidden away. (2) In Theorem 1, the theorem is only non-vacuous for either m growing or c ~ log L. (3) Typos in theorem statements, e.g., missing O in theorem 3 and Lemma 3.\nA: (1) We are indeed stating our theorems with full alertness. In Theorem 2, How the probability depending on \u201cc\u201d is clearly spelled out in the proof.  To get the claimed probability and bound, it is required that $c>\\ tau\\sqrt{L}\\sqrt{\\log23}$. We note that the constant c is irrelevant to the values of $L$ because $\\tau\\sqrt{L}=O(1)$. We can choose the coefficient of $\\tau$ small enough to enable $c$ small.  We make the dependency of $c$ explicit in the theorem statements in the updated paper. (2) This is not at all an issue. Theorem 1 states the high probability bound of the spectral norm and how the probability scales with $m, c$ and $L$, which produces a condition on $m$ that $m >(1/c^2) * (\\log L)$. As usually done in non-asymptotic analysis, we first state the conditions on $m$ and finally take the intersection over all collections of conditions to guarantee the theorems simultaneously. (3) There is no missing $O$ in Theorem 3 and Lemma 3.\n\n3. Avoid using big-O and big-Omega notations in the proofs as much as possible. In the proof of theorem 1, after \u201ctaking an \\epsilon-net over \u2026\u201d, the probability does not change despite applying a union bound! \nA: We add in the updated paper a full procedure of $\\epsilon$-net argument. A new factor ($m\\log 23$) induced by $\\epsilon$-net is hidden in $\\exp(-\\Omega(mc^2))$. We try our best to make the argument clear enough with necessary exposure of detailed math formula while maintaining the readability.\n\n4. The empirical results are interesting with room to improve (1) the value of the learned \\tau after training: is it still of the order 1 / \\sqrt{L}? Or does it take some other value. (2) whether it is better to have a \\tau per layer or one for the whole network. (3) include the standard deviation and change the figure 4 with axes starting at zero.\nA: (1) Thanks for pointing out this question. The initial values of $\\tau$ for ResNet 20/32/56/110/1202 are $\\{0.33, 0.26, 0.19, 0.13, 0.04\\}$ and the learned values of $\\tau$ are $\\{0.38, 0.35, 0.33, 0.31, 0.27\\}$. However, if setting the initial values to be the learned values, the deep ones explode. (2) We have tried to have a separate $\\tau$ each layer but it does not give better performance than a shared $\\tau$. (3) We update the paper with the reviewer\u2019s suggestion. \n\n5.

We address the concerns as follows.\n1. As for the depth dependence, the stability result (Theorem 1) shows that the forward and backward processes are stable if the width $m$ scales with $\\log L$ while a similar result for vanilla feedforward network (Allen-Zhu et al.2018) requires the width $m$ scales at least with $L\\log L$. \nThe convergence result (Theorem 4) states that the depth dependence is polynomial with $L$, which comes only from the semi-smoothness characterization (Theorem 6). As we discussed in the paragraph after Theorem 6, the depth dependence term in the semi-smoothness characterization is relatively small to other terms under the over-parameterized regime e.g. $m>L$ (we note that this does not mean that $m$ scales with $L$ linearly). Hence the depth dependence in the convergence result is much weaker than the case of feedforward network.\nFor experiments, we tried much deeper ResNet in Appendix I and the training curves is similar to that in Fig. 1 as a $\\log $ term dependence is hard to reveal in experiments.\n\n2. It was pointed out by others that our result and proof may be used to show the spectral norm of a product of i.i.d. matrices that is called the top Lyapunov exponent, which might have interesting applications in stochastic stability in addition to the convergence analysis of gradient descent for ResNet. We believe this is suitable for future study.\n\n3. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the typos and grammars. The paper is updated with careful grammar checking.

E.g. in theorem 2 the probability must have some dependency on c hidden away, which should be made explicit, especially given the assertion \u201cwhere c can be arbitrarily small\u201d. Similarly, in theorem 1, it is claimed that c is constant, but the theorem is only non-vacuous for either m growing or c ~ log L. There are also some typos in theorem statements (e.g. missing O in theorem 3 and lemma 3), which can easily confuse the reader.\n\n- Although I did not have time to check all the proofs, they should be treated with more care. I recommend avoiding big-O and big-Omega notations in the proofs as much as possible, as it can make some steps extremely confusing: in the proof of theorem 1, after \u201ctaking an \\epsilon-net over \u2026\u201d, the probability does not change despite applying an union bound! The union bound argument should be more clearly spelled out, especially given the fact that some smoothness should also be established for this argument (e.g. the trivial sub-multiplicative bound).\n\n- The empirical results are interesting, and I think could be taken even further. Indeed, the authors show promising results for learning a global scale parameter (in terms of performance), and it would be interesting to explore: 1) the value of the learned \\tau after training: is it still of the order 1 / \\sqrt{L}? Or does it take some other value. 2) whether it is better to have a \\tau per layer or one for the whole network. The presentation of the current results could be improved by including standard deviation when averages are reported, and changing figure 4 with axes starting at zero (bar charts which do not start at zero are extremely misleading).\n\n- There are also many typo and grammar issues. Although these do not seriously impede understanding, the paper could be improved by addressing those (at least running a spell-check)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1309/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1309/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["huishuai.zhang@microsoft.com", "yuda3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn", "v-minyi@microsoft.com", "wche@microsoft.com", "tie-yan.liu@microsoft.com"], "title": "STABILITY AND CONVERGENCE THEORY FOR LEARNING RESNET: A FULL CHARACTERIZATION", "authors": ["Huishuai Zhang", "Da Yu", "Mingyang Yi", "Wei Chen", "Tie-yan Liu"], "pdf": "/pdf/fe8ea761dbe96d8595808de8aed51982c91d1ee9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We characterize the stability and convergence of gradient descent learning ResNet, unveiling the theorectical and practical importance of tau =1/sqrt(L) in the residual block.", "abstract": "ResNet structure has achieved great success since its debut.

Theoretical findings are corroborated via experiments confirming the validity of the 'cutoff' value. Additional experiments are conducted indicating that using the cutoff value, ResNet can be trained even without normalization layers, and that the cutoff value is also beneficial with normalization as it allows effective training of very deep ResNet.\n\nThis is an interesting submission which presents important theoretical results while also showing their practical pertinence via experimental validation. \n\nThe paper is well written and the presentation is clear. Prior work is reviewed appropriately.  The reviewer found it particularly informative to provide intuition and present a proof sketch next to each theoretical results. \n\nThe convergence analysis leads to a depth dependence of ResNet and the authors claim that this is not a *real* dependence and  attributes it to bounding techniques handling non smooth activation. The authors further indicate in their experiments that for a given width the convergence of ResNet does not depends *much* on depth, compared to feedforward networks. So there might still be a dependence though much milder than that found by the current theory.  It would be interesting to more precisely characterize the dependence observed in experiments.\n\nThe authors claim that their analysis leading to the non-asymptotic bound on the spectral norm of the feedforward process via martingale theory might be relevant for other problems. It would be useful if the authors could elaborate and in particular indicate if their technique could carry to analyse other structures beyond ResNet. \n\nMinor comments:\n\"What else values\" ---> Are there other values \n\"our first claim is a new spectral norm\" -->  is a new bound of the spectral norm\n\"we does no make such\" --> we do not make\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1309/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1309/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["huishuai.zhang@microsoft.com", "yuda3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn", "v-minyi@microsoft.com", "wche@microsoft.com", "tie-yan.liu@microsoft.com"], "title": "STABILITY AND CONVERGENCE THEORY FOR LEARNING RESNET: A FULL CHARACTERIZATION", "authors": ["Huishuai Zhang", "Da Yu", "Mingyang Yi", "Wei Chen", "Tie-yan Liu"], "pdf": "/pdf/fe8ea761dbe96d8595808de8aed51982c91d1ee9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We characterize the stability and convergence of gradient descent learning ResNet, unveiling the theorectical and practical importance of tau =1/sqrt(L) in the residual block.", "abstract": "ResNet structure has achieved great success since its debut.

Robust Initialization for WeightNorm & ResNets\u201d. Given your work provides an in-depth analysis of the same initialization for ResNets that we derived in our paper (tau=1/sqrt(L) ), I think it is important to mention that the current description of our work in your paper is not fully accurate. You mention that in our derivation of initialization scheme for ResNets, we do not provide any theoretical justification for ||f(h)|| = ||h||, where f(.) is a residual block. This is not true. This condition is true because the weights of a residual block are initialized such that the residual block is norm preserving. We have derived this initialization for weight normalized networks in our paper. Further, our initialization scheme for ResNets works irrespective of the presence or absence of normalization layers as long as the two conditions you reported are met. And this condition is indeed true for un-normalized network with ReLU activation under He initialization (see \u201cThe Benefits of Over-parameterization at Initialization in Deep ReLU Networks\u201d).\n\nThese comments aside, I found the theoretical results of your paper (especially on convergence using 1/sqrt(L) initialization) interesting (disclaimer: I have not looked through the proofs). The experimental results are also promising. I think it is great that an initialization much simpler than Fixup works better in practice.", "title": "Inaccurate description of our paper"}, "signatures": ["~Devansh_Arpit2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~Devansh_Arpit2", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["huishuai.zhang@microsoft.com", "yuda3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn", "v-minyi@microsoft.com", "wche@microsoft.com", "tie-yan.liu@microsoft.com"], "title": "STABILITY AND CONVERGENCE THEORY FOR LEARNING RESNET: A FULL CHARACTERIZATION", "authors": ["Huishuai Zhang", "Da Yu", "Mingyang Yi", "Wei Chen", "Tie-yan Liu"], "pdf": "/pdf/fe8ea761dbe96d8595808de8aed51982c91d1ee9.pdf", "TL;DR": "We characterize the stability and convergence of gradient descent learning ResNet, unveiling the theorectical and practical importance of tau =1/sqrt(L) in the residual block.", "abstract": "ResNet structure has achieved great success since its debut. In this paper, we study the stability of learning ResNet. Specifically, we consider the ResNet block $h_l = \\phi(h_{l-1}+\\tau\\cdot g(h_{l-1}))$ where $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is ReLU activation and $\\tau$ is a scalar. We show that for standard initialization used in practice, $\\tau =1/\\Omega(\\sqrt{L})$ is a sharp value in characterizing the stability of forward/backward process of ResNet, where $L$ is the number of residual blocks. Specifically, stability is guaranteed for $\\tau\\le 1/\\Omega(\\sqrt{L})$ while conversely forward process explodes when $\\tau>L^{-\\frac{1}{2}+c}$ for a positive constant $c$.  Moreover,  if ResNet is properly over-parameterized, we show for $\\tau \\le 1/\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{L})$ gradient descent is guaranteed to find the global minima \\footnote{We use $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\cdot)$ to hide logarithmic factor.}, which significantly enlarges the range of $\\tau\\le 1/\\tilde{\\Omega}(L)$ that admits  global convergence  in previous work. We also demonstrate that the over-parameterization requirement of ResNet only weakly depends on the depth, which corroborates the advantage of ResNet over vanilla feedforward network. Empirically, with $\\tau\\le1/\\sqrt{L}$, deep ResNet can be easily trained even without normalization layer. Moreover, adding $\\tau=1/\\sqrt{L}$ can also improve the performance of ResNet with normalization layer.", "keywords": ["ResNet", "stability", "convergence theory", "over-parameterization"], "paperhash": "zhang|stability_and_convergence_theory_for_learning_resnet_a_full_characterization", "original_pdf": "/attachment/afd5def25761f74be71c3d05f26f92d1243b6099.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2020stability,\ntitle={{\\{}STABILITY{\\}} {\\{}AND{\\}} {\\{}CONVERGENCE{\\}} {\\{}THEORY{\\}} {\\{}FOR{\\}} {\\{}LEARNING{\\}} {\\{}RESNET{\\}}: A {\\{}FULL{\\}} {\\{}CHARACTERIZATION{\\}}},\nauthor={Huishuai Zhang and Da Yu and Mingyang Yi and Wei Chen and Tie-yan Liu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJe-oRVtPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
