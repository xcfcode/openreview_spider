Essentially, I\u2019ve not seen its key difference from the classification problem. While `even in the case of completely identical candidates, the label can be 1 in some situations, and in some other situations the label can be 0\u2019, why not including such `situations\u2019 into your feature vector (i.e., x)? Once you do it, the gap between learning to select and classification will vanish. If this is not doable, you should better make more discussions, especially on what the so-called `situations\u2019 are.  Furthermore, the application scope of the proposed framework is not very well discussed. If it is restricted to job dispatching scenarios, why do we need a new concept \u201clearning to select\u201d?\n\nThe proposed model looks quite straightforward. Standard CNN is able to capture the variable length input as is done in many NLP tasks. Dynamic computational graph is not new either. In this sense, the technical novelty of this work is somehow limited.\n\nThe experiments are weak in that the data are simulated and the baselines are not strong. I\u2019ve not gained enough insights on why the proposed model could outperform the alternative approaches.

It looks to me that the data used in experimental section is simulated data, rather than real data. \n3. It looks to me that baselines such as CNN did not perform well, mainly because in test stage, some candidates that CNN picked as the best do not actually qualify.
