While it has proved useful for the efficient communication in chemistry, it is unclear what advantage there is in developing machine learning systems that operate on this representation directly, rather than on the graph structure it encodes. Constraining the learning problem via the neural network architecture can be important to acheiving good performance with deep learning systems; by requiring the network to learn the relationship between the SMILES encoding and the graph structure, and without offering any new information, I would expect this approach to perform worse than the graph convolution approach in general. The authors show similar performance using graph convolution and SMILES-based approaches, but I am skeptical that it would hold up under further experiments or additional hyperparameter tuning. In addition, wouldn't using a graph convolution architecture result in better interpetability?\n\nOther work has explored the use of recurrent neural networks that take SMILES as input.

The simple models seem to perform better than more elaborate alternatives, and comparably to state of the art. \n\nAs someone who is not an expert in this field (computational chemistry) it is hard for me to assess the novelty of this work. The authors compare to several recent approaches, some of which are their own.  Moreover, the scores that they present seem to rely on a combination of the present method and their previous method, but this combination is not clearly explained (\"Applying a recently developed pre-training approach, Goh et al. (2017b) on the final SMILES2vec model, the following validation performance metrics were obtained: AUC of 0.81 for the Tox21 dataset, AUC of 0.80 for the HIV dataset, and RMSE 1.2 kcal/mol for the FreeSolv dataset.\")\n\nThey compare against Chemception, their previous deep CNN that uses images, but again the takeaway from this comparison is unclear since the methods patently use different inputs. \n\nPros\n- simple method seems to obviate need for domain-specific knowledge\n- seems to perform well on three prediction / regression tasks\n\nCons\n- authors do not explain the point of the task to lay readers (why are chemical structures encoded in text?)\n- authors do not explain the nature of the inputs / outputs to lay readers\n- authors do not explain very convincingly the wider implications of the results to lay readers\n- novelty unclear given that the authors themselves did much of the prior comparison work\n- the ICLR workshop is looking for \"late-breaking developments, very novel ideas and position papers\".
