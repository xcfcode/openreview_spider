This work achieves reasonable performances without explicit class labels. I accept this paper.\n\nNotes:\n- The paper introduces the semantic similarity loss which is to learn similarity in the embedding space given similarity between targets. In the ablation study, the loss function plays an important role in improving results. \n- Also, they introduce the KL divergence term between the embedding distribution and binary target distribution. The paper also shows that the performances without the KL loss. With the KL loss, the proposed model shows substantial improvement.\n- The paper did experiments on different hash code lengths and showed better performances on the longer hash code\n\nI strongly accept this paper. This paper introduces novel loss functions and demonstrates that their method shows improvement in fully supervised and weakly supervised settings.", "rating": "5: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper65/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/LLD/Paper65/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SHREWD: Semantic Hierarchy Based Relational Embeddings For Weakly-Supervised Deep Hashing", "authors": ["Heikki Arponen", "Tom E Bishop"], "authorids": ["heikki@intuitionmachines.com", "tom@intuitionmachines.com"], "keywords": ["Deep Hashing", "Content Base Image Retrieval", "Semantic image relations", "Weakly Supervised learning", "Representation Learning"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new method for training deep hashing for image retrieval using only a relational distance metric between samples", "abstract": "Using class labels to represent class similarity is a typical approach to training deep hashing systems for retrieval; samples from the same or different classes take binary 1 or 0 similarity values.
