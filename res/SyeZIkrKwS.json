The dynamic kernels are obtained by a linear combination of static kernels where the weights of the linear combination are input-dependent (they are obtained similarly to the coefficients in squeeze-and-excite). The authors also include a theoretical and experimental study of the correlation.\nThe authors conduct extensive experiments on image classification and segmentation and show that dynamic convolutional kernels with reduced number of channels lead to significant reduction in FLOPS and increase in inference speed (for batch size 1) compared to their static counterparts with higher number of channels.\n\n=== Recommendation ===\nThe experimental setup is rigorous but the current draft lacks some metrics that should be reported (as training times, parameter counts, memory requirements at training/inference) since the focus is on making CNNs more efficient.\n\nThe presented experimental results are satisfactory but the studied networks are not quite SOTA: they are much more competitive alternatives to ResNet and MobileNetv2. The correlation study is interesting.\n\nMy main issue with the paper is the lack of novelty. The use of dynamic convolutions is by no means a novel idea and has been studied in multiple previous works in vision (mixture of experts, soft conditional computation, pay less attention with dynamic convolutions, ...) which the authors fail to cite/compare against.\nHowever, most previous work focuses on leveraging dynamic kernels to use more parameters so the focus on accelerating CNNs is novel.\n\nOverall, I am on the fence with this paper but slightly leaning towards rejecting it for the above reasons.\n\n=== Questions/Comments ===\n- Figure 5: how are the models constrained to have same FLOPS? Is it by changing the number of channels?\n- Consider adding training times for more transparency\n- Consider adding parameter counts in experiment tables\n- The related work subsection 2.3 is rather poor compared to existing work.\n- 'While model compression based methods' -> 'On the other hand, model compression based methods'\n- 'computing efficient' -> 'compute efficient'\n- 'values distribute' -> 'values distributed'\n- 'DETAIL ANALYSIS OF OUR MOTIVATION' -> 'Detailed analysis of our motivation'", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1718/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1718/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhangyikang5@huawei.com", "zhangjian157@huawei.com", "wangqiang168@huawei.com", "zorro.zhongzhao@huawei.com"], "title": "DyNet: Dynamic Convolution for Accelerating Convolution Neural Networks", "authors": ["Kane Zhang", "Jian Zhang", "Qiang Wang", "Zhao Zhong"], "pdf": "/pdf/1805cd4025104e121d1f8ca13b2d67fe1bb8b534.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a dynamic convolution method to significantly accelerate inference time of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.", "abstract": "Convolution operator is the core of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and occupies the most computation cost.

Please see comments below.", "comment": ">>> Response to \u201cFigure 5: how are the models constrained to have same FLOPS?\u201d:\nThanks for your valuable question which help us realize some unclear statements. By changing the number of channels of MobileNetV2, we can get MobileNetV2(0.35), MobileNetV2(0.5), MobileNetV2(0.75), MobileNetV2(1.0) and MobileNetV2(1.4). To constrain our models to have the same FLOPS with them, we keep the channels of each layer the same as the original one, while replacing the conventional convolution with dynamic convolution. If we ignore the additional FLOPs of coefficient prediction module and dynamic generation module, which is negligible, the FLOPs will stay the same. This result shows that our proposed dynamic convolution can be deployed as a plug-and-play unit to replace conventional convolution.\nWe realize that it is not proper to call these models \u201cDy-mobile\u201d because they have different structures. In the updated version we will call them as Dy-MobileNetV2(0.35), Dy-MobileNetV2(0.5), Dy-MobileNetV2(0.75), Dy-MobileNetV2(1.0) and Dy-MobileNetV2(1.4).\n>>> Response to \u201cConsider adding training times and parameter counts.\u201d:\nThanks for your suggestion! We will add parameter counts in experiment tables and discuss the training time in Sec 4.3 in the revision.\n>>> Response to \u201cLack of novelty.\u201d:\nFor previous works on dynamic convolution, they all directly generate convolution kernels via a linear layer (including \u201cpay less attention with dynamic convolutions\u201d). In computer vision tasks, the parameter counts of convolution is large, which makes the number of parameters of the linear layer unbearable. In our proposed method, the linear layer is merely used to predict the coefficients for linearly combining static kernels. It can solve this problem and thus be used to achieve real speed up for CNN on hardware. \nThe most related work is \u201csoft conditional computation\u201d. They focus on using more parameters to make models to be more expressive while we focus on reducing redundant calculations in convolution. According to the theoretical analysis in appendix A and correlation study in Figure 6, we find that correlations among convolutional kernels can be reduced via dynamically fusing several kernels. Thus different from \u201csoft conditional computation\u201d which replaces the conventional convolution directly, we recommend to reduce the channel numbers (we reduce half of the channels for convolution layers in Dy-ResNet18/50 and Dy-shuffle) and then replace conventional convolution with dynamic one. We think this may bring a larger improvement. For example, compared with directly replace the conventional convolution in ResNet18, Dy-ResNet50 reduce 37.9% FLOPs while improves 2.03% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Moreover, since this paper is submitted to NeurIPS2019 this May as well, it may be regarded as a concurrent work\nWe will add a comparison against existing work in Sec 2.3."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1718/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1718/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhangyikang5@huawei.com", "zhangjian157@huawei.com", "wangqiang168@huawei.com", "zorro.zhongzhao@huawei.com"], "title": "DyNet: Dynamic Convolution for Accelerating Convolution Neural Networks", "authors": ["Kane Zhang", "Jian Zhang", "Qiang Wang", "Zhao Zhong"], "pdf": "/pdf/1805cd4025104e121d1f8ca13b2d67fe1bb8b534.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a dynamic convolution method to significantly accelerate inference time of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.", "abstract": "Convolution operator is the core of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and occupies the most computation cost.

Please see comments below.", "comment": ">>> Response to \u201cThe only difference with SENet is the introduction of g_t where the output dimension is much larger than SENet.\u201d:\nThanks for your meaningful question! The motivation of our proposed approach is different from SENet. We focus on reducing the computation cost during inference stage, while SENet learns channel-wise importance to recalibrates feature maps. From the methods point of view, during training, indeed the only difference is that the output dimension is much larger than SENet. However, during inference, SENet recalibrate feature maps by learned weights, while we fuse kernels instead of fusing feature maps, which can reduce the output dimension and computation cost of convolution kernels.\nMoreover, as discussed in Sec 4.5, our proposed method will be the same as SENet when g_t=1. However, compared with g_t=6, its performance drops a lot while the computation cost of convolution stay the same as shown in Table 6.\n>>> Response to \u201cHow can this method save computations compared to classical convolution?\u201d:\nThanks for your valuable comments! The goal of our proposed approach is to reduce the computation cost in the inference stage. Equation (2) only shows that fusing feature maps is mathematically equivalent with fusing kernels. During training, we firstly generate C_cout*g_t output feature maps and then get C_out feature maps by fusing each g_t ones. Thus we can not save computation cost in training procedure. However, we fuse kernels during inference stage instead of fusing feature maps. After fusing, the weight for one convolution layer with shape [C_out*g_t, C_in, k, k] will become [C_cout, C_in, k, k], thus the FLOPs is reduced by g_t times.\n>>> Response to \u201cWhy larger g_t doesn`'t increase the flops in Table 5?\u201d:\nCompared with g_t=1, the computation cost of convolution is 6 times larger when g_t=6 during training. However, we will fuse each g_t kernels to get dynamic convolutional weight with shape [C_cout, C_in, k, k] during inference as Equation (1), it makes the FLOPs of convolution invariable with g_t. As for the additional FLOPs of fusing kernels, it varies with g_t but is negligible.

But we cannot find the number of parameters in this paper.\n- The parameter $g_t$ is defined as 6. The experiment shows the ablation to the case $g_t$ =1, but what if we set the parameters to other numbers?\n\nStrong points\n- The proposed model achieved improvement with fewer Flops on large scale image classification dataset.\n- The method shows effectiveness when it is attached to various classification networks.\n\nConcerns\n- The main concern of the reviewer is that the model shares the core contribution to the existing method; squeeze-and-excitation network (SEnet, Hu et.al.). The method also proposes the attention-based scaling of channels, where the attention comes from GAP, so the reviewer thinks that it is possible to explain this work as some variation of SEnet.\nThe author should clarify the difference and the strong points of the proposed block compared to SEnet.\n- Also, the reviewer cannot guarantee that the networks trained by the proposed method can transfer the knowledge to other tasks such as detection. \nThe reviewer thinks that it is a critical part because one of the primal reasons for training the network is to use them as the pre-trained backbone for the other tasks.\nRegarding this, the baseline methods (MobileNet V2, Shufflenet v2, ResNet)  are widely used as a pre-trained backbone for object detection, and the papers mention the CoCo object detection results using the pre-trained backbones from their method. The reviewer thinks that the experiment regarding this should be included.\n- The other thing is that the parameter increases. As in the question, the reviewer thinks that the number of parameters would be increased. The reviewer agrees that some recent works focus more on Flops, but the number of parameters is also discussed in general, when telling about the 'model size'.\n\nConclusion\n- The author proposed a dynamic kernel selection method (add-on), which can enhance the classification accuracy of the baseline network. \n- However, the reviewer cannot convince the novelty of the proposed approach and usefulness of the pre-trained backbone network from the proposed method when applying it to the other tasks (Object detection).\n\n\nInquiries\n- Clarifying the difference between SEnet.\n- Testing the ImageNet trained network of the proposed method into an object detection task (as the pre-trained backbone).\n- Discussing the number of the parameter as well.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1718/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1718/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhangyikang5@huawei.com", "zhangjian157@huawei.com", "wangqiang168@huawei.com", "zorro.zhongzhao@huawei.com"], "title": "DyNet: Dynamic Convolution for Accelerating Convolution Neural Networks", "authors": ["Kane Zhang", "Jian Zhang", "Qiang Wang", "Zhao Zhong"], "pdf": "/pdf/1805cd4025104e121d1f8ca13b2d67fe1bb8b534.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a dynamic convolution method to significantly accelerate inference time of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.", "abstract": "Convolution operator is the core of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and occupies the most computation cost.

The proposed module named dynamic convolution is detailed in Sec 3.2. As far as I can see, it is very similar to the former SENet especially in Figure (3) and Equation (2). The only difference is the introduction of g_t where the output dimension is much larger than SENet.\n\n2. As shown in Equation (2), the proposed method contains the normal computation of fixed kernels. How can this method save computations compared to classical convolution?

It might be worth noting that our previous work also studies the benefits of using input-dependent convolutional kernels over static convolutional kernels in the image classification and detection settings: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04971 . I\u2019d be very interested in better understanding the differences between our two approaches.\n\nI also had a clarifying question about the work. In Table 5, why does increasing the group size (g_t) not change the MFLOPs of the network? In my understanding, the coefficient prediction module and dynamic generation module would both require more computation with larger values of g_t.\n\nThanks!\n\n", "title": "Related work"}, "signatures": ["~Brandon_Yang1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~Brandon_Yang1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhangyikang5@huawei.com", "zhangjian157@huawei.com", "wangqiang168@huawei.com", "zorro.zhongzhao@huawei.com"], "title": "DyNet: Dynamic Convolution for Accelerating Convolution Neural Networks", "authors": ["Kane Zhang", "Jian Zhang", "Qiang Wang", "Zhao Zhong"], "pdf": "/pdf/1805cd4025104e121d1f8ca13b2d67fe1bb8b534.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a dynamic convolution method to significantly accelerate inference time of CNNs while maintaining the accuracy.", "abstract": "Convolution operator is the core of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and occupies the most computation cost. To make CNNs more efficient, many methods have been proposed to either design lightweight networks or compress models. Although some efficient network structures have been proposed, such as MobileNet or ShuffleNet, we find that there still exists redundant information between convolution kernels. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic convolution method named \\textbf{DyNet} in this paper, which can adaptively generate convolution kernels based on image contents. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we apply DyNet on multiple state-of-the-art CNNs. The experiment results show that DyNet can reduce the computation cost remarkably, while maintaining the performance nearly unchanged. Specifically, for ShuffleNetV2 (1.0), MobileNetV2 (1.0), ResNet18 and ResNet50, DyNet reduces 40.0%, 56.7%, 68.2% and 72.4% FLOPs respectively while the Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet only changes by +1.0%, -0.27%, -0.6% and -0.08%.
