The authors agree with R3 on this matter; (2) the proposed unbiased estimator is not practical, e.g. it leads to overfitting when the cross-entropy loss is used, it is unbounded from below as pointed out by R1; (3) the two proposed modifications of the unbiased estimator are biased estimators, which defeats the motivation of the work and limits its main technical contributions; (4) R2 rightly pointed out that the assumption that complementary label is selected uniformly at random is unrealistic \u2013 see R2\u2019s suggestions on how to address this issue. \nWhile all the reviewers acknowledged that the proposed biased estimators show advantageous performance on practice, the AC decides that in its current state the paper does not present significant contributions to the prior work, given (1)-(3), and needs major revision before submitting for another round of reviews. \n\n", "confidence": "5: The area chair is absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "Meta-Review"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1305/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1305/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Complementary-label learning for arbitrary losses and models", "abstract": "In contrast to the standard classification paradigm where the true (or possibly noisy) class is given to each training pattern, complementary-label learning only uses training patterns each equipped with a complementary label.

We would like to demostrate a very simple example (with a single validation split).  We report the classification accuracy with Fashion-MNIST with just one trial: Free(proposed):59.06% / gradient-ascent(proposed):79.58% / forward[Xiyu'18]:46.72% / pairwise-comparison[Ishida'17]:76.03%.  9 hyper-parameter candidate combinations of weight decay (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6) and learning rate (1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6) were used with 150 epochs.  SGD with momentum 0.9 was used for optimization.  We reported the test accuracy of the best model based on validation score (calculated from only complementarily-labeled data) from all epochs and all hyper-parameter combinations.  For forward method [Xiyu'18], we simply used their proposed learning objective for validation criteria.  The model was multi-layer perceptron with d-50-1 (In Figure 2, d-500-1 was used).  Due to the time constraint, we were able to only finish a very simple setup with a single trial, with very few hyper-parameters and few candidates for each of them, so our main message here is not the result itself (for example \u201cforward\u201d is too weak and we can guess optimal hyper-parameters were not included), but to show that validation is possible with our unbiased estimator.  We would like to report results for extensive experiments in the final version.\n\nQ) The hyper-parameters are fixed.  Will this implicitly handicap / favor some over others?\nA) Our motivation of the experiments was to demonstrate the failure of the proposed method based on Theorem 1, and how the two modifications solve the overfitting issues and show test results of all epochs during training.  However, as you point out, this is not a good demonstration of comparing with the best hyper-parameter for each method, so we showed some simple experimental results that tune hyper-parameters with (complementary labeled) validation data in the answer to your previous question.  We will add more experiments to demonstrate this.\n\nQ) Uniform assumption is na\u00efve.\nA) A potentially biased (but consistent) method has already been proposed for a non-uniform assumption [22], but one of our future work is to explore if proposing a non-uniform version of the unbiased estimator is possible or not.\n\nQ) The only justification of the uniform assumption is the mixed setting of crowdsourcing, but there is no mixed setting in experiments.\nA) We would like to demonstrate with more experiments using the mixed setting with both ordinary and complementary labels."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1305/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1305/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1305/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Complementary-label learning for arbitrary losses and models", "abstract": "In contrast to the standard classification paradigm where the true (or possibly noisy) class is given to each training pattern, complementary-label learning only uses training patterns each equipped with a complementary label.

Indeed, the authors show that minimising their original estimate for the cross-entropy loss leads to overfitting. While the authors attribute this behaviour to the fact that the estimate can be negative, I believe the loss being negative is not problem per se (for example, substituting 0/1 loss with -100/-99 loss would not change the learning; similarly, this is not a problem for the losses considered in [Ishida'17]). I would rather attribute the problem to the fact that the proposed estimate is unbounded from below and there are no generalisation guarantees for it. Indeed, assuming there exists a training example that appears in the training set only once, with one complementary label, estimate (8) can be made arbitrary small by just training to predict probability 0 for the provided complementary label on that example ( and any non-zero probability for other classes). \n- to cope with the above mentioned problem, the authors propose two heuristic-based modifications of the estimate, which are potentially biased.

Specifically, this paper proposes an unbiased estimator that accepts arbitrary loss functions and models. Noting that this proposed estimator can suffer from overfitting due to unbounded negative loss, a lower-bounded estimator is proposed. Experiments are then performed on several image classification datasets.\n\nPros:\n- This paper addresses a creative form of weak supervision, proposed by prior work, in which labels that are *not* the true label are labeled, in a clear fashion.\n\n- The first proposed estimator is unbiased, as shown by a proof, and accepts arbitrary losses, an improvement over prior approaches\n\n- The overall presentation is clear and clean\n\nCons:\n- One of the main claims of the paper is the proposal of an unbiased estimator. However, this estimator then does not seem to work well enough due to degenerate negative loss.  So then a modified version is proposed- which does not appear to be unbiased?  Either way, no assertion or proof of it being unbiased is given.  So then presumably this also reverses the claim of being able to cross-validate?  This seems like a major weakening of the paper's contributions\n\n- Since the unbiased estimator does not appear to work well, two implementations of a corrected one are proposed, using heuristic approaches without explicit theoretical guarantees.  This shifts the burden to the experimental studies.  These are somewhat thorough, but not extremely so: for example, one set of hyperparameters were used for all of the methods?  This seems like it could implicitly handicap / favor some over others?\n\n- The proposed estimator is based on the assumption that the probability of classes in the complement set (the set of labels other than the one marked as incorrect) is uniformly distributed (e.g. see beginning of Proof of thm 1).  However, this seems like a potentially naive assumption. Indeed, in the related work section, it is mentioned that work in 2018 already considered the case where this uniformity assumption does not hold.\n\n- More broadly, but following from the above: The paper does not provide any real world examples, real or hypothetical, to give the reader an idea of whether the above uniformity assumption---or really any of these assumptions---are well-motivated or empirically justified.  At the bottom of page 3 in the related work, a concrete application used in prior work is mentioned---where crowd workers are shown single labels and vote Y/N, leading to a mix of standard (if Y) and complement-labeled (if N) data---however this mixed setting is not considered explicitly in this paper.  So, how is the reader supposed to get any idea of whether the assumed setup is motivated or justified?  The experiments do not provide this, because the complementary labels are synthetically generated according to the model assumed in the paper.  Additionally, it is briefly mentioned that collecting complementary labeled data is faster, but again no concrete examples are given to support this.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1305/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Complementary-label learning for arbitrary losses and models", "abstract": "In contrast to the standard classification paradigm where the true (or possibly noisy) class is given to each training pattern, complementary-label learning only uses training patterns each equipped with a complementary label.

Consistency of Losses for Learning from Weak Labels. ECML 2014.\n\nThe work of [Cid-Sueiro2014] proposes a general way how to construct losses for learning from weak labels. They require that the distribution of weak labels is a linear transformation of the true label distribution, i.e. the assumption (3) of the paper under review. According to [Cid-Sueiro2014], the loss on weak labels is constructed by $weak_loss = L*original_loss$, where $L$ is the left inversion of the \"mixing matrix\" $T$ in (3). [Cid-Sueiro2014] also shows that such weak loss is classification calibrated which implies statistical consistency of the method. \n\nLearning from complementary labels is a special case when the mixing matrix is $T=(E-I)/(K-1)$ (E is unitary matrix, I is matrix of ones, K is number of labels). In this case, the left inversion of $T$ is simply $L=- E*(K-1) + I$ and so the weak loss is $weak_loss=L*loss$ which corresponds to the loss (5) proposed in the paper under review (in fact, the loss (5) also adds a constant term (Y-2)/(Y-1) which however has no effect on the minimizer). \n\nThe novel part of the paper is the non-negative risk estimator proposed in sec 3.3 and the online optimization methods addressed in sec 3.4.
