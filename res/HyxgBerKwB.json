However, as an *application* paper, our main novelty is to use a simple recent method (GCN) that is well motivated given the problem and that outperforms previous methods which have been developed for more than a decade. If our main strength had been the introduction of technical novelty, we would have followed a different evaluation strategy for a conclusive argument, mainly testing the method in different scenarios, while being less thorough in each experiment.

However, by reviewing recent graph network literature, we noticed that the research community is far from reaching an agreement on what the standard formulation of a message-passing GCN should be (the graph-based submissions in this current edition of ICLR speak for themselves). This is not uncommon and has happened in the past with e.g. convolutional layers that nowadays we assume to be standardized. For this reason, we decided to briefly discuss the algorithmic implementation that we use in our method. \nSection 2.3 is meant as a reference for the reader that is already familiar with GCN variants and had to be kept brief due to space constraints. In the same paragraph, we cite Battaglia et al., which serves as a reference for our implementation, and which we encourage to consult for a thorough investigation.\n\nTo make the paper more accessible, we slightly modified section 2.3 and added a lengthy explanation of message-passing layers in the appendix section C.1, where all algorithmic steps are motivated and illustrated.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n5) \u201cFigure 3b) shows that there is a cluster of predicting 0\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a keen observation. We double checked the predictions for individual targets and identified target T060 to be the problem. Figure 16 in the appendix clearly shows that the model defaults to predicting a small constant value for all decoys of T060, while predicting reasonable scores for all other targets. As a sanity check, we compared the plots of GraphQA with those of GraphQA-RAW, i.e. the model trained without self information, dssp and partial entropy features (in the repository they are located at results/allfeatures/CASP12/global_gdtts_funnel.pdf and results/residueonly/CASP12/global_gdtts_funnel.pdf respectively). It turns out that the model trained on \u201craw\u201d amino acid features does not output the same degenerate predictions as its counterpart (the predictions are not perfect, but definitely better than a constant). We suspect that some error in the data pipeline might have produced misleading features for T060, e.g. the multiple sequence alignment program that extracts self information and partial entropy, or the DSSP program that computes secondary structure features.

Here we separately address the concerns raised.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n1) \u201cMethodological novelty is low -- this is a straightforward application of GCN\u201d \n\nWe understand the reviewer\u2019s concern about technical novelty in general, but, in our opinion, this paper should be evaluated from an application perspective rather than for its technical novelty.\nWe have minor *technical* novelties regarding 1) the graph representations we use and 2) the co-optimization of local and global scores. We certainly understand these are not enough for a *technical* paper.  However, as an *application* paper, our main novelty is to use a simple recent method (GCN) that is well motivated given the problem and that outperforms previous methods which have been developed for more than a decade. If our main strength had been the introduction of technical novelty, we would have followed a different evaluation strategy for a conclusive argument, mainly testing the method in different scenarios, while being less thorough in each experiment. On the other hand, as positively indicated by all reviewers, we chose to focus on a thorough analysis of this novel application, in terms of ablation studies of features and model components, multiple datasets, and different evaluation metrics.\n\nFinally, we thank the reviewer for noting that \u201cresults show a decent improvement over the state of the art in this particular application\u201d. In that regard, we would also like to note that this is an application paper aligned with the ICLR call for papers that explicitly lists \u201ccomputational biology\u201d as a relevant application domain. \n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n2) \u201cThe objective of QA is a bit suspect [...] using experimentally resolved protein structures\u201d\n\nThis is a thoughtful remark about the limitations of QA that transcends this work\u2019s research question. Here we provide explanations as well as additional results to alleviate this concern. \nOur evaluation setup uses \u201cold\u201d datasets (CASP 7-10, 2007-2013) for training and the most recent datasets (CASP 11-13, 2015-2019 and CAMEO) for testing. As pointed out, all proteins in these datasets share a common factor that is instrumental for quantitative evaluations, namely that experimental determination of protein structure is feasible (e.g. they can be crystallized and scanned under an x-ray microscope). Other than this source of bias, which is explicit and outside our control, we believe that the scale and diversity of the targets considered for testing ensures a sufficient level of generalization. CASP 11, 12, 13 and CAMEO, in fact, portray a large spectrum of non-disordered proteins, e.g. ranging from very short to very long chains, from stand-alone to part of a complex, from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. A QA method that achieves good performances across these diverse datasets has the potential to correctly score computationally-modeled decoys of proteins whose true structure is unknown.\nFinally, as an additional study, we include a performance comparison between transmembrane and soluble proteins (section D.2). Predictably, GraphQA performs better on soluble proteins, which are more numerous in the training set, but it also scores transmembrane proteins to an acceptable degree.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________ \n3) \u201cSeparation encoding is done as a one-hot vector.\u201d\n\nThanks for bringing up this interesting question, it was definitely something worth looking into. There are actually two types of distances in play in the edges of our protein graphs: the spatial distance and the sequential distance (or separation). Our initial approach was to encode the spatial distance using a single RBF kernel and the separation as a categorical variable over biologically-motivated bins. \nAs suggested by the reviewer, we conducted additional studies with several variants of this choice. For the spatial distance we tried: 1) removing it, 2) using the scalar value in Angstrom, 3) encoding the distance using 32 RBF kernels with unit variance. For the separation we tried: 1) removing it, 2) using the scalar separation (integer), 3) using a categorical encoding.\nOur findings, which are now included in the updated revision (section D.1), are the following. Categorical separation performs better than a scalar value for LDDT scores, while the effect on GDT_TS is minimal. For spatial distances, RBF encoding performs marginally better than the other two, both on LDDT and GDT_TS scores.

Clearly, the recent CASP 13 represents an important dataset and is great of interest for many researchers. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now tested our model on publicly available targets of CASP13 and we report a comparison with other top participants of the challenge (section F.3). This comparison can be unfair since GraphQA is only trained on CASP 7-10, while other participants have likely (re)trained their models on all previous CASP datasets as well as other datasets. However, even without retraining, we achieve performances that are in line with the results presented for CASP 11 and 12.\n\nTo strengthen our experimental evidence, we have also tested our model on the CAMEO dataset as well.

This means that our response can be sometimes repetitive (for overlapping concerns) across different reviewers. We apologize for this redundancy.\n\nOn top of the individual responses, we would like to comment on the relevance of our work. We suggest that our application paper should mainly be evaluated based on the following merits that it possesses: \na) the novelty of the method within the domain of the application,\nb) the relevance of the paper to the venue,\nc) the quality of the experiments,\nd) the significance of the results. \n\nWe believe we cover these aspects as follows: \na) this is the first time that Graph Networks are used for protein model quality assessment,\nb) \u201ccomputational biology\u201d is listed as a relevant application field in ICLR call for paper,\nc) as indicated by reviewer 1 and 2, we provide thorough ablation studies of both feature representations and architectural components using several controlled runs per setup, which makes our experiments informative and reliable for follow-up works,\nd) finally, as indicated by all three reviewers, our simple model works noticeably better than prior works, on several datasets, and according to various evaluation metrics.\n\nTo support this point, there are many application papers that have been considered relevant at top ML conferences for the aspects listed above. Here we report one representative paper each from the latest ICLR, NeurIPS and ICML conferences, that are closest to our work (without claiming that the opposite cases do not exist).\n\na) Similar OpenReview discussion regarding the technical novelty of a protein application paper, published at ICLR 2019: \u201cHuman-level Protein Localization with Convolutional Neural Networks\u201d, https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryl5khRcKm \nb) Graph Networks applied to a niche field, but with significant improvements and thorough analysis, published at ICML 2019: \u201cCircuit-GNN: Graph Neural Networks for Distributed Circuit Design\u201d, https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=4826\nc) Another niche application using a general gated graph recurrent network with noticeable performance published at NeurIPS 2019: \u201cDevign: Effective Vulnerability Identification by Learning Comprehensive Program Semantics via Graph Neural Networks\u201c, https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=14038\n\nFurthermore, we argue that thoroughness and conclusiveness of experiments should outweigh technical novelties for an application paper.

In particular, protein structure prediction is a very active area of research witnessing steady progress during the previous decade or so. To estimate the quality of the prediction, many experimentally resolved structures are needed. However, experimental structure determination is expensive and many protein families are notoriously hard to experiment with. Thus, current estimates of the quality of the protein structure prediction models are incomplete and biased. As a result, there is an interest in guessing quality of protein structure predictions on protein families that are not characterized experimentally. Previous papers already proposed several neural network architectures for the QA task. This paper shows that GCN applied on a graph of a predicted protein structure achieves higher accuracy than the previously proposed neural networks\n\nStrengths:\n+ The proposed GCN outperforms other neural network baselines.\n+ The protein representation is reasonable.\n+ The paper is reasonably well written with a nice overview of the related work.\n+ Ablation studies are well done, in clean graphs. This can be useful for other authors who work with GCNs.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Methodological novelty is low -- this is a straightforward application of GCN \n- The objective of QA is a bit suspect for the sole reason that the training and testing is performed using experimentally resolved protein structures. This data set is biased and there are no guarantees that the reported accuracy will hold over a vast range of protein families that are not structurally characterized.   \n- Separation encoding is done as a one-hot vector. This could probably be passed as a scalar value. Would be nice to have comparison between 1-hot vs scalar in the experimental results\n- Formulas in section 2.3 are cryptic for audience unfamiliar with GCN and it is not specific to this application.\n- Figure 3b) shows that there is a cluster of predicting 0 where the ground truth is bigger than 0.6.\n\nOverall, this is a borderline paper. There is little methodological novelty and the QA application is a bit of a niche problem in bioinformatics. However, the results show a decent improvement over the state of the art in this particular application, so this paper might be of importance for a limited audience interested in this problem.

Based upon this graph representation, the manuscript describes a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict both local (i.e., per residue) and global quality.
