It can dramatically save the compute and storage requirements for action recognition. The experiment results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve the best results over the baselines.\n\nStrength:\n1. Self-supervised compressed video understanding is an exciting topic. It can save computation and storage for online video understanding.\n2. The two pretext tasks are efficient and straightforward for compressed video understanding.\n \nQuestions:\n\n1. Figure 2 is misleading, T_I is k times smaller than T_M,3D Deconv should be on the top and 3D Conv should be on the bottom; the image cubes are also incorrect -- they are supposed to be placed in H-W-C plane. Please re-organize the text and the figures to make the main text clear.\n2. The authors design two pretext tasks according to the heuristic: pyramidal motion statistics prediction and correspondence type prediction. I want to say the authors have done a fair evaluation, but the approach's novelty is limited. I would like to see more discussion about the intuition of the proposed method.\n3.

We clarified novelty & provided more discussion about the intuition", "comment": "We appreciate your constructive comments and an acknowledgement that our work studies \u201ca new problem\u201d and \u201can exciting topic\u201d of self-supervised compressed video understanding. \n\n* **Figure 2:** \n\n    * Thanks for pointing out that the Deconv and 3D Conv blocks are misplaced. This was our mistake and we have fixed it in the revision.\n\n    * The image cubes are actually correct; we had a coordinate sign specifying that the cubes are in the T-HW-C plane. The updated figure now highlights the coordinate system in red. \n\n* **Novelty & intuition:** Our novelty mainly comes from the way we exploit the inherent structure of compressed videos for self-supervised representation learning. As our response to R4 below indicated, we wanted to use simple and intuitive techniques to clearly show the benefit of our ideas. The reviewer is making a great point that providing a discussion about intuition is important for this. Below we provide more insights about the PMSP and CTP tasks.\n\n    * The PMSP task exploits the videographer bias -- i.e., videos are purposely recorded to highlight important objects and their movements. The PMSP task encourages our network to learn discriminative representations that help capture the most vibrant regions in the spatio-temporal space. We note that Sec. B in the Appendix provides extended discussion about the intuition of PMSP with empirical evidence; we kindly ask the reviewer to revisit Sec.B and C in the Appendix, especially the captions of Figures 5-12, as they provide comprehensive insights about the task.\n\n    * The CTP task largely follows the intuition of correspondence prediction often used in self-supervised learning, including contrastive learning approaches (we also mentioned this in the paper). However, our formulation is slightly nuanced in that the negative P-frames not only come from different videos, i.e., Fig. 4(b) Random -- as is typically done in the literature, e.g., [Korbar et al., 2018, Owens & Efros 2018] among others -- but also come from the same clip in a different frame order, i.e., Fig. 4(c) Shuffle and 4(d) Shift. The intuition is that providing negative P-frames of the same clip will encourage the network to learn more discriminative representations based on local (frame-level) correspondence, while the first type only provides global (clip-level) correspondence signals. We believe that the use of \u201cShuffle\u201d and \u201cShift\u201d negatives has not been explored before (though its technical novelty is not overwhelmingly high). We have added this discussion in the paper to emphasize the nuanced difference. \n\n* **Contrastive baseline:** Thank you for this great suggestion! We evaluated the contrastive baseline using the vanilla InfoNCE loss used in SimCLR [Chen et al., 2020], taking negatives by randomly shuffling the embeddings of the I-frames and the P-frames within the same batch. This achieved 73.9% on UCF-101 and 43.7% in HMDB51 (we have added the new results in Table 3).  We note that this baseline is somewhat similar to the CTP (Binary) baseline (in Table 3) in that both methods use negative P-frames from a different clip; the only meaningful difference is that one is multi-class classification and another is a binary classification. Our new result confirms the importance of adding the \u201cShuffle\u201d and \u201cShift\u201d negatives (Fig 4)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1222/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1222/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-Supervised Learning of Compressed Video Representations", "authorids": ["~Youngjae_Yu1", "~Sangho_Lee1", "~Gunhee_Kim1", "~Yale_Song1"], "authors": ["Youngjae Yu", "Sangho Lee", "Gunhee Kim", "Yale Song"], "keywords": ["Compressed videos", "self-supervised learning"], "abstract": "Self-supervised learning of video representations has received great attention.

The approach takes advantage of compressed videos, using the encoded residuals and motion vectors within the video codec. Using encoded videos has been shown to reduce computation time required by decoding videos. Previous works have explored compressed videos for supervised recognition, showing the potential, while this paper introduces a way to leverage compressed videos for self-supervised learning.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed IMRNet shows benefit over previous supervised compressed video approaches. The paper proposes two self-supervised tasks related to compressed videos: one to predict the spatial locations with movement and one to predict the temporal matching of the inputs (Correspondence Type Prediction).\n\nThe Correspondence Type Prediction tasks are fairly standard, and have been explored by many previous works (which are cited). The main difference being the use of the compressed video features instead of rgb frame or audio.\n\nAn interesting observation is that the two tasks when combined don't seem to be any better, roughly 0.1%-0.3%, which is likely within noise on smaller datasets like HMDB and UCF101.\n\nThe comparisons in Table 3 are missing comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches. For example,\n- \"Cooperative learning of audio and video models from self-supervised synchronization\", NeurIPS'18 \n- \"Audio-visual scene analysis with self-supervised multisensory features\", ECCV'18\n- \"Evolving Losses for Unsupervised Video Representation Learning\", CVPR'20\n\nall outperform this approach. While those approaches use audio features and are not specifically focused on compressed videos, there's nothing about them making them incompatible with compressed videos using say only I-frames. I think Table 3 could be improved by comparing to existing approaches for non-compressed videos as well as using those approaches on compressed videos. This would help show the benefit of the proposed tasks.\n\nThe paper has some missing details. One of the claims is that compressed videos is faster, which is shown in Table 2. But there are some missing details, for example, the number of training epochs is not reported (only that 30 are used for warmup). How many does this use? How much faster is this method than non-compressed method?\n\nThere are also some other related works, e.g.\n\"AssembleNet: Searching for Multi-Stream Neural Connectivity in Video Architectures\", ICLR'20\nproposes a similar idea to the bidirectional connections and\n\"AssembleNet++: Assembling Modality Representations via Attention Connections\", ECCV'20\nproposes ideas similar to the multimodal gated attention.\n\n\nOverall, the paper is interesting.

We show that our approach achieves competitive performance on compressed video recognition both in supervised and self-supervised regimes. \n", "one-sentence_summary": "We propose a self-supervised approach to learning compressed video representations.", "pdf": "/pdf/32a283d43ef9e69a3039580759776862664a9146.pdf", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "yu|selfsupervised_learning_of_compressed_video_representations", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nyu2021selfsupervised,\ntitle={Self-Supervised Learning of Compressed Video Representations},\nauthor={Youngjae Yu and Sangho Lee and Gunhee Kim and Yale Song},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=jMPcEkJpdD}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
