We maintain this field-specific common practice in our dataset, hence, our synthetic and real images were generated using a single structure each. As a side note, the authors would like to emphasize that we formed ahead of time a team of cross-domain researchers to ensure that the dataset would follow the standard practice of the crystallography community. \n\nOur results show that a model trained on diffraction from a synthetic crystal structure generalizes to a different real crystal structure. Our model achieves up to 94% accuracy on real images, using a purely synthetic training set. We note that there are two challenges in the real/synthetic experiments, namely,  the reality gap and the different structures. Our new CNN topology overcomes both simultaneously. We believe a small validation set with real data is a reasonable requirement for these results.\n\nWe have included in the paper that DiffraNet\u2019s synthetic data was generated with a single crystal structure. We will further clarify in the camera ready that generating data with a single structure is common practice in crystallography. We will also add that our real data was generated with a single, and different, structure. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper414/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper414/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper414/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DiffraNet: Automatic Classification of Serial Crystallography Diffraction Patterns", "abstract": "Serial crystallography is the field of science that studies the structure and properties of crystals via diffraction patterns.

We also address the questions directly below.\n\n- In what way the diffraction images are \u2018synthetic\u2019? Aren\u2019t they actual diffraction images but in a controlled known and controlled setting: set of parameters (beam, structure to analyze)?\n\nThe images are synthetic in the sense that they have been generated via the nanoBragg simulator instead of being recorded from real X-ray crystallography experiments.\n\n- How many structures were analyzed (Were there 25000 for the 25000 pattern images), one image each?\n\nWe have simulated a single crystal, but in 25000 orientations with different diffraction parameters. The X-ray beam intensity varied widely, as did the volume of crystalline material in that beam relative to non-crystalline matter.  This wide dynamic range is a big factor in making this kind of data difficult to analyze.\n\n- What variations for each of the setting variabilities (X-Ray beam (flux, beam size, divergence, and bandpass), crystal properties (unit cell, number of cells, and a structure factor table), and the experimental parameters (sources of background noise, detector point-spread, and shadows)) were used? \no This is to assess the size of the pattern space.\n\nWe use air and water as sources of background noise and vary parameters of the X-ray beam. The beam intensity varies widely from shot-to-shot with a Gaussian distribution and the RMS fluctuation of the X-ray pulses was made to be equal to the mean. The X-ray wavelength was also given a Gaussian distribution with RMS variation. We also vary crystal parameters as detailed above. We do not vary the other parameters for this dataset. Many of these parameters are varied from shot-to-shot, which creates a diverse dataset. This means each image in our dataset is generated with a different parameter setting, and consequently, results in a different pattern. \n\n\n- Were any real-life setting obtained pattern samples classified using DiffraNet dataset patterns\u2019 fine-tuned classification algorithms?\no Were all the structures analyzed crystalline?\no It\u2019s stated in Figure 2 and Table 6 that 2 classes are either blank or no-crystal but is that a known fact (purposely chosen) or no pattern images for crystalline structures due to inadequate experimental settings to uncover the crystalline nature of the analyzed structure?\n\nFollowing the reviewers' suggestions we have been working on testing our models in real experimental images. We have generated a real dataset for this purpose with 457 images generated from the same crystal. Our final objective is to provide the real dataset together with the synthetic dataset. We currently split this dataset into validation (~80% of the dataset, for a total of 366 images) and test sets (~20%, 91 images) and use AutoML tools to find the best configurations for each of our models based on their accuracy on the real validation set. So far, we have hit ~94% accuracy using this methodology, we will add these results to the paper before the rebuttal deadline. Regarding the synthetic dataset, our dataset uses a single structure (Photosystem II), which is crystalline. Images with category \u2018noxtal\u2019 and \u2018blank\u2019 have zero contribution from the crystal lattice, anything larger than zero went into \u2018weak\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, or \u2018strong\u2019.\n\n- Were the pattern images pre-processed in any manner before being classified? \n\nYes, we took the square root of the 16-bit images to make them 8-bit. We also rescale them to the [0,1] range. For DeepFreak, we subtract the mean as is usually done in CNNs. We have added this information to the paper.\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper414/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper414/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper414/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DiffraNet: Automatic Classification of Serial Crystallography Diffraction Patterns", "abstract": "Serial crystallography is the field of science that studies the structure and properties of crystals via diffraction patterns.

We address the points raised below.\n\n1. The authors believe that DiffraNet is a challenging dataset. This statement is supported by the following: 1) High-resolution images (512x512), which make off the shelf tools not useful without domain-specific adaptation (our architecture adaptations can be found in Table 8). Simply downsampling the input image to the image size accepted by ResNet leads to poor performance (96.79% training accuracy and 72.08% validation accuracy); 2) Our best accuracy on the real dataset is 94%, suggesting that a great deal of improvement can be achieved; 3) DiffraNet will evolve in an increasingly challenging dataset over time by introducing new important structures like images with ice rings on top of the diffraction patterns and images with overlapping lattices. There is considerable overlap between these classes and our current diffraction classes, which makes classification more challenging.\n\nIn addition, the methodology that we introduced, namely, the automated search of algorithm parameters (i.e., feature extractors) and, type of model and models hyperparameters (i.e., AutoML), highlights a common current problem in computer vision which is the automation of end-to-end algorithms including the downsampling (when the input image size is different from the ImageNet 224x224 resolution). The size of the ImageNet images can be considered a specific choice of embedding in an arbitrary Cartesian structure that cannot fit other image resolutions. The fundamental question to ask is \"How do we downsample from a generic input image size such that we can leverage the well-validated representational power of off-the-shelf CNNs optimized for 224 x 224 Cartesian embeddings?\". Our work on the DiffraNet microcosm is a first step to answer this question and we plan to build on top of our methodology to effectively tackle this problem.\n\nFinally, one of the ICLR topics is \"applications in vision, [...], or any other field\", which makes our paper compelling for ICLR.\n\n\n2. The authors agree with the reviewer. We have generated a real dataset for this purpose with 457 images which will be released together with the synthetic dataset. The results on the real data hit ~94% accuracy with our models. To achieve these results, we split this dataset into validation (~80%, 366 images) and test sets (~20%, 91 images) and use AutoML as described in the paper to find the best configurations for each of our models based on their accuracy on the real validation set. We do not add any real image to the training set. We will add these results to the paper before the rebuttal period deadline. \n\nWe argue, however, that pre-training our models with other datasets (e.g. ImageNet) may not improve performance on data drawn from a domain with fundamentally different imaging physics. Dunnmon et al. (2018), for instance, have shown that there is little to no contribution to using ImageNet pre-trained weights on datasets larger than 20,000 images drawn from X-ray radiography, i.e., using pre-trained weights from ImageNet did not improve performance on their chest radiographs dataset. Our dataset represents a similar scenario, and thus we do not expect a great deal of improvement from pretraining on a fundamentally different data distribution. Besides, DeepFreak uses an adapted architecture, which means there is no pretrained model readily available for us. \n\n\nJared A. Dunnmon, Darvin Yi, Curtis P.

In this paper, we introduce a new serial crystallography dataset generated through the use of a simulator; the synthetic images are labeled and they are both scalable and accurate. The resulting synthetic dataset is called DiffraNet, and it is composed of 25,000 512x512 grayscale labeled images. We explore several computer vision approaches for classification on DiffraNet such as standard feature extraction algorithms associated with Random Forests and Support Vector Machines but also an end-to-end CNN topology dubbed DeepFreak tailored to work on this new dataset. All implementations are publicly available and have been fine-tuned using off-the-shelf AutoML optimization tools for a fair comparison. Our best model achieves 98.5% accuracy. We believe that the DiffraNet dataset and its classification methods will have in the long term a positive impact in accelerating discoveries in many disciplines, including chemistry, geology, biology, materials science, metallurgy, and physics.", "keywords": ["Serial Crystallography", "Deep Learning", "Image Classification"], "authorids": ["arturluis@dcc.ufmg.br", "leob@dcc.ufmg.br", "shollatz@slac.stanford.edu", "mattfel@stanford.edu", "kunle@stanford.edu", "jmholton@slac.stanford.edu", "acohen@slac.stanford.edu", "lnardi@stanford.edu"], "authors": ["Artur Souza", "Leonardo B.
