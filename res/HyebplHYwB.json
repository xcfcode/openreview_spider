The approach is presented as an efficient numerical algorithm for working with diffusion on data manifolds.\n\nI am very much in doubt about this paper as there are too many aspects of the work I do not (currently) understand. I suspect that the underlying idea is solid, but in its current form I cannot recommend publication of the paper.\n\nDetailed questions and comments:\n\n*) It seems that the focus is on GANs and related models that do not come with a likelihood. In my reading, the practical problem that the paper address is model comparison in models that do not have a likelihood. Is that correct? If so, I am left to wonder why models with a likelihood a not discussed, and why the such models aren't included in the experiments? Wouldn't the likelihood be a sensible baseline?\n\n*) The term \"multi-scale\" is not defined until page 3. I'd recommend defining this term much more early or avoid its use until its defined.\n\n*) I found the geometric exposition to be rather confusing. In Sec. 3.1 emphasis seem to initially be on Euclidean diffusion, and at some point emphasis changes to diffusion on graphs. Sometimes the paper seem focused on diffusion on general manifolds. I found this exposition to be rather chaotic, and I suspect that this is the root cause of me not understanding many aspects of the work.\n\n*) In Sec. 3.2 the notion of diffusion *on* manifolds is discussed. At some point (not quite clear to me when) the results of this discussion is applied to diffusion *between* manifolds. I don't quite understand what it means to diffuse between manifolds. I would have appreciated a more explicit exposition here.\n\n*) In the concluding remarks it is stated that IMD provides guarantees. Which guarantees are that?\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2564/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2564/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tsitsulin@bit.uni-bonn.de", "marina.munkhoeva@skolkovotech.ru", "davide@cs.au.dk", "piekarras@gmail.com", "bron@cs.technion.ac.il", "i.oseledets@skoltech.ru", "mueller@bit.uni-bonn.de"], "title": "The Shape of Data: Intrinsic Distance for Data Distributions", "authors": ["Anton Tsitsulin", "Marina Munkhoeva", "Davide Mottin", "Panagiotis Karras", "Alex Bronstein", "Ivan Oseledets", "Emmanuel Mueller"], "pdf": "/pdf/363c65692ab623e314b23da974417f909c856b06.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a metric for comparing data distributions based on their geometry while not relying on any positional information.", "abstract": "The ability to represent and compare machine learning models is crucial in order to quantify subtle model changes, evaluate generative models, and gather insights on neural network architectures.

Please find our responses below.\n\nWith respect to bounding the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, the bound is the loosest for isospectral manifolds / graphs. While there are known isospectral constructions for both Riemmanian manifolds [1,2] and graphs [3], it is conjectured that the proportion of isospectral graphs drops to zero with increasing number of nodes [4].\n\nRegarding the restrictions of scale due to the normalization term $e^{-2(t+t^{-1})}$, this term prevents the blowup of heat kernel trace as the scale parameter $t$ approaches 0 from the right. In practice, this temperature scale ($t \\approx 0$) does not bring any information except the difference in the number of nodes in the graph (samples in the data), i.e. $\\sum_i^n e^{-0\\lambda_i} = n$. Going further away from 0, we can observe this behaviour from the Taylor expansion of the matrix exponential of the heat kernel trace for kNN graphs $h_t \\approx n - tn + t^2n$. We empirically observe that when $t<0.5$ first two terms of the Taylor expansion approximate the heat trace with a very small error ($<10^{-3}$) with no information that is \"interesting\" in terms of the shape.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] J.

We hope that our response and improved exposition of the paper will address the concerns.\n\n[#1] We consider a general problem of comparing the geometry of samples drawn from unknown data distributions, including cases without any model and, consequently, without likelihood. In our experiments, we study a diverse set of applications, focusing on the scenarios that were not previously possible in the literature. For example, in the experiment in Section 4.2 we compare word embeddings across languages with no model attached to it and unaligned vocabularies. In a different vein, in Section 4.3 we consider similarities in representations for networks *across datasets*, this scenario is not possible to study using traditional methods such as [2, 3]. Besides, even for likelihood-based models, the objective has been shown to not always be sensible for out-of-distribution examples [1].\n\n[#2,#3] We have improved the text for a better exposition. The discussion in Section 3.1 starts with heat diffusion in the Euclidean space to present the most common space in the machine learning literature. We shift the focus to graph Laplacians constructed from the samples from general manifolds since they are known to approximate their diffusion properties (see Theorem 1). We then approximate graphs\u2019 spectrum with stochastic Lanczos quadrature method and use the approximated spectral descriptors to compute the lower bound to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the underlying manifolds.\n\n[#4] The diffusion process does **not** occur between manifolds. Instead, to compare manifolds we compute the distance **between the descriptors** of these manifolds obtained by the diffusion inside each of them. Such a distance lower bounds an optimal matching of the heat kernel defined on each manifold and thus the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between manifolds.\n\n[#5] IMD inherits several guarantees from past literature, and, in addition, we provide approximation error guarantees in Theorem 2.  IMD is supported by multiple theoretical statements, while not all of them are error guarantees, we make sure all the steps in the algorithm are principled. IMD is an approximation of the lower bound of the spectral Gromov-Wasserstein distance, as per bounds of (M\u00e9moli, 2011). We use an OR-graph construction to approximate the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying data manifold, as per (Ting et al., 2010). Then, we approximate the lower bound with Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature, and do so with error controlled by our Theorem 2.\n\n[1] E.

We have incorporated points #4-#13  into the updated version of the paper, and will continue to work on better presentation of the work after this comment is posted, i.e. we will include an algorithm and update the introduction as requested. We discuss some of the points below for better exposition.\n\n[#1] In machine learning it is common to treat the data as points sampled from some unknown distribution in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We mention data moments to contrast with existing techniques for measuring closeness between two samples. We propose to make use of the geometry of samples instead. We treat samples as coming from some manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (possibly equipped with its own distribution). \n\n[#4]  An **extrinsic property** undergoes a change when transformations like rotation of shifts are applied to data. For example, the mean of a Gaussian is not invariant under shift, but variance is. An **intrinsic property** stays invariant under **all** isometric transformations (dependent only on the metric tensor). The intuition behind **multi-scale property** of the heat kernel is closely connected with time parameter t. As t grows larger, heat kernel depends on larger neighborhoods of points, so the heat kernel values can serve as a description/summary of the neighborhood at different scales. This is similar to the high-order moments of the data if we treat it in a traditional way as having an unknown distribution in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ from which it is sampled. The more moments of a distribution we know, the more we know about its shape. In a similar way the heat kernel accumulates the shape information of the manifold covering all the possible moments of the data seen as a distribution.\n\n[#14] We mention that eigenvalues of the graph/shape can be inferred from the spectrum. The exact procedure is defined in the remark 4.8 in (M\u00e9moli, 2011); we have added this reference to the main body of the paper. In short, we iteratively seek eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ such that $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty}{e^{\\lambda_i t} hkt(t)} \\not= 0$, starting from $\\lambda_0$. This allows to establish an equivalence relation between the spectrum and the heat kernel trace, allowing us to make precise statements about the informativeness of our metric."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2564/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2564/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tsitsulin@bit.uni-bonn.de", "marina.munkhoeva@skolkovotech.ru", "davide@cs.au.dk", "piekarras@gmail.com", "bron@cs.technion.ac.il", "i.oseledets@skoltech.ru", "mueller@bit.uni-bonn.de"], "title": "The Shape of Data: Intrinsic Distance for Data Distributions", "authors": ["Anton Tsitsulin", "Marina Munkhoeva", "Davide Mottin", "Panagiotis Karras", "Alex Bronstein", "Ivan Oseledets", "Emmanuel Mueller"], "pdf": "/pdf/363c65692ab623e314b23da974417f909c856b06.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a metric for comparing data distributions based on their geometry while not relying on any positional information.", "abstract": "The ability to represent and compare machine learning models is crucial in order to quantify subtle model changes, evaluate generative models, and gather insights on neural network architectures.

(3.1) notation: in the body paragraph the authors use $k(x, x', t)$ but in ``definition 1\" they used $k(x, y, t)$ \n13. (3.1) ``$c$ disconnected components\" to ``$c$ connected components\" \n14. (3.1) the authors could elaborate more about how HKT contains all the information in the graph's spectrum. Currently, they only stated the limit equal to the number of connected components. \n15. Github code is helpful but it would be better if they can include an algorithm section\n16.
