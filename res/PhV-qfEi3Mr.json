My first question is why is that the case? The claim that quantization reduces analog noise does not seem to be correct. As far as I can tell, this setup leads to quantization noise on top of analog noise. This is a very serious point since the authors just assume this claim to be true (first para of page 3) and that is the whole motivation. The claim should be justified, or at least a reference should be provided. P.S., I do not think the claim is correct; two noise sources (quantization + analog) is worse than one noise source (analog only).\n\nSecond issue: what is the contribution of this paper? As far as I can tell, two old methods (LLoyd max and dithering) are used and that's it. Sure, the experimental section is massive but this paper does not claim to be a pure empirical study. In fact, the claim is that for the first time, a general quantizer is used. Those methods have been around for decades!\n\nThe experiments only use quantization. One would expect that CACIM would be emulated somehow and we would see that indeed the proposed method improves CACIM's accuracy (which I don't think it would as discussed above). Even the conclusion talks about digital systems. So CACIM was (erroneously) used to motivate the work but then completely forgotten. \n\nPost Rebuttal Comments:\n\nI thank the authors for their feedback.

The authors propose to directly calculate the endpoints that minimize the quantization error according to the weight distribution of each layer. Empirical results on image classification tasks and object detection tasks show that the proposed method outperforms other compared weight quantization methods under the same number of bits.\n\nStrengths: \n- The paper is clearly written and the proposed method is simple.\n- Experiments are performed on image classification tasks CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with extensive comparisons with other methods. \n\nWeaknesses: \n- Since the Floyd algorithm requires alternating minimization between q and e, one concern is that this may be costly. How often is the Floyd algorithm called in Algorithm 1? What is the training time compared with other methods?\n\n- Comparison with one important reference [1] is missing. [1] also learns the quantized values, but (i) through the step size instead of the endpoints,  and (ii) uses uniform distributed quantized values instead of non-uniformly distributed ones. However, the reported results in [1] show that their 3-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit quantized models on ImageNet have  smaller accuracy gaps with the full-precision baseline compared to the proposed method. \n\n- One other concern is that while the authors claim that this method is proposed for compute-in-memory (CIM) system, and discussed in section 5 that the property of the CIM does not restrict the quantized values to be uniformly strictly, compared to digital systems, there is no empirical comparison of the efficiency (e.g. storage, latency) of the proposed method and other quantization methods in CIM. Do they just perform similarly in terms of computation and memory efficiency? If so, when the uniform quantization in [1] already has good accuracy, using generalized quantization as in the proposed method does not seem quite well-motivated?\n\n[1] Esser, Steven K., et al. \"LEARNED STEP SIZE QUANTIZATION.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3029/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3029/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving the accuracy of neural networks in analog computing-in-memory systems by a generalized quantization method", "authorids": ["~Lingjun_Dai1", "~Qingtian_Zhang1", "~Huaqiang_Wu1"], "authors": ["Lingjun Dai", "Qingtian Zhang", "Huaqiang Wu"], "keywords": ["analog computing-in-memory", "quantization algorithm", "deep neural networks"], "abstract": "Crossbar-enabled analog computing-in-memory (CACIM) systems can significantly improve the computation speed and energy efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs).

The results in this work show that utilizing the analog characteristic of CACIM systems can obtain better quantization. That is the main contribution of this work.

Below we address the concerns mentioned in the review:\n1.\tWe agree that two noise sources are involved. In order to improve the robustness of analog written weights to circuit variation, a noise-aware training scheme is used. To apply a DNN model in CACIM systems, we usually train a model on GPU or CPU and then mapping the weights on crossbar arrays in CACIM systems. Two main issues are involved. Firstly, the mapping overhead is directly related to the precision of weights. We used quantized weights to decrease mapping overhead. Secondly, the mapping noise is non-negligible and degraded the performance of networks severely. We used a noise-aware training scheme to improve the robustness to noise. Both the quantization method and the noise-aware training need to tune the weights. Therefore, in this paper, we combine the quantization method and the noise-aware training to obtain the low-precision and high-robustness weights. \n2.\tTo quantize DNN models in CACIM systems, the previous works even the newest ones [1],[2] used uniform or log-wise quantization algorithm. Their performance is not as good as ours. It is all because we found that there are no weights encoding and decoding processes in CACIM systems and utilized this characteristic to select a more powerful quantization algorithm. This characteristic is so important that not only allows us to use more powerful quantization algorithms but may also design some other specific algorithm for CACIM systems to improve the performance. We discussed the principles of CACIM-oriented algorithm design and explained why we used the generalized quantization method on the last page of the new submission.\n3.\tBy adding random noise to each weight in the inference phase, we tried to simulate the performance of a DNN in the CACIM system. Table 1-4 in the paper included the experiment results which are obtained in this simulation way. And to further demonstrate the reliability of the results, we conducted more experiments that mapping the weights to the real crossbar arrays and using the measurement values to verify our method. Related experiment results are shown in Part 4.4 in the new submission. The noise-aware training scheme indeed improved the robustness of the DNN model.\n\n[1] Qu, Songyun, et al. \"RaQu: An automatic high-utilization CNN quantization and mapping framework for general-purpose RRAM Accelerator.\" 2020 57th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC).

About the concerns about the novelty of our methods, we found that there are no weights encoding and decoding process in the CACIM system, which may be very suitable for the generalized quantization method.

In digital computers, set B needs additional memory overhead of additional operation projection during the computing process. Which in CACIM, the quanta are storage by analog devices. Set A and set B have the same quantization levels so that the mapping overhead and inference time cost are same. The statement of the range of quantizer may be misleading.

The algorithm will only be used when the weight projection falls outside a given range. In a typical fine-tuning process, the Lloyds\u2019 algorithm will only be triggered a few times. For example, when fine-tuning a Resnet-18b up to 45x10^4 iterations on ImageNet task from a pre-trained model, the Lloyds\u2019 algorithm is only used less than 10 times, which is negligible. We compare the training time of ternary weight ResNet-18 model with that of full precision one, the former is empirically only 1.064 times than the latter. The additional training time cost introduced by quantization is acceptable.\n2.\tThere are two main differences between the reference [1] and our work. Firstly, the quantization precision is different. Reference [1] used 3-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit quantized models. While we used 3-level, 4-level, and 8-level quantized weights. 3-bit is 8-level. Secondly, both the weights and activations are quantized in reference [1], while only the weights are quantized in our work. In CACIM systems, the weights are represented by the conductance of analog devices. The multiply-accumulate operation directly used the analog conductance without converting to digital signals. While the activations are usually implemented by digit circuits. The difference between the underlying representation mechanisms let us decide not to quantize the weights and activations together. \nThe experimental results show that our 4-level and 8-level quantized models on ImageNet have smaller accuracy gaps with the full-precision baseline compared to the 2-bit and 3-bit quantized model in reference [1]. Note that the reference used 8-bit weights and activations in the first and last layers, which can provide a large benefit to performance. In our work, we quantized all the layers with the same precision.\n3.\tIn the inference phase of DNN on the CACIM system, our proposed method and other quantization methods in CACIM just perform similarly in terms of computation and memory efficiency. After different quantized weights obtained by different quantization algorithm mapping to memristor devices in the CACIM system, the hardware computing process is independent of the conductances of memristor devices.

The biggest problem from my perspective is that: the proposed quantization method is disentangled with CACIM: It only considers that quantized weight has its unique advantages in analog computation.

Using quantization to make the deployment of CACIM feasible is straightforward and interesting. \n\n2. The proposed method was validated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with different models. \n\n\nCons:\n1. Combining quantization and CACIM is interesting. However, I am concerning the novelty of methods used in this paper. The 'general quantization' used in this paper is quite similar to Product quantization. [Stock, Pierre, et al. \"And the bit goes down: Revisiting the quantization of neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.05686 (2019).] Quantization by grouping and k-means is well-known in this community. \n\n2. In the abstract, the authors claim that 'The analog weight has its unique advantages when doing quantization. Because there is no encoding and decoding process, the range of quantization function will not affect the computing process.' When we do quantization for the digital device, we quantize (almost) continual (high precision) numbers into discrete numbers. The range of quantizer is telling us which range we want to pay more attention to during quantization. Although I agree with the claim that 'there is no encoding and decoding.', I didn't follow the sentence 'the range of quantization function will not affect the computing process'. More explain should be provided about 'what is the definition of the range of quantizer and why it will impact quantization in the digital system and it will not impact quantization in the analogy system.'", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3029/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3029/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving the accuracy of neural networks in analog computing-in-memory systems by a generalized quantization method", "authorids": ["~Lingjun_Dai1", "~Qingtian_Zhang1", "~Huaqiang_Wu1"], "authors": ["Lingjun Dai", "Qingtian Zhang", "Huaqiang Wu"], "keywords": ["analog computing-in-memory", "quantization algorithm", "deep neural networks"], "abstract": "Crossbar-enabled analog computing-in-memory (CACIM) systems can significantly improve the computation speed and energy efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the transition of DNN from the digital systems to CACIM systems usually reduces its accuracy. The major issue is that the weights of DNN are stored and calculated directly on analog quantities in CACIM systems. The variation and programming overhead of the analog weight limit the precision.\nTherefore, a suitable quantization algorithm is important when deploying a DNN into CACIM systems to obtain less accuracy loss. The analog weight has its unique advantages when doing quantization. Because there is no encoding and decoding process, the set of quanta will not affect the computing process. Therefore, a generalized quantization method that does not constrain the range of quanta and can obtain less quantization error will be effective in CACIM systems.
