The core idea is to analytically compute the pixels that changed across frames and only apply the convolution operation to those pixels.

In general, the paper does not compare against any other existing work which reduces compute for video analysis, e.g., tracking. This makes it harder to appreciate the contribution or practical benefit of using this method.\n- The paper has many spelling and grammar mistakes - \"siliarlity\", \"critiria\" etc.\n- Continuous convolutions - It is not clear to me what is meant by this term. It is used many times and there is an entire section of results on it (Table 6), but without clearly understanding this concept, I cannot fully appreciate the results.\n- Section 5.2 - what criteria or metric is used to compute scene similarity?\n- Overall, I think this paper can be substantially improved in terms of providing details on the proposed approach and comparing against baselines to demonstrate that Dynamic-Convolutions are helpful.\n- Design decisions such as cell-based convolution (Figure 3) are never evaluated empirically.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper235/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DynCNN: An Effective Dynamic Architecture on Convolutional Neural Network for Surveillance Videos", "abstract": "The large-scale surveillance video analysis becomes important as the development of intelligent city.

It suggests an approach called Dynamic Convolution consists of Frame differencing, Prediction, and Dyn-Convolution steps. The idea is to reuse some of the convolutional feature maps, and frame features particularly when there is a significant similarity among the frames. The paper evaluates the results on 4 public datasets. However, it just compares the approach to a baseline, which is indeed applying convnet on all frames. \n\n- State of the art is not well-studied in the paper. Video understanding approaches usually are not just applying convnet on all frames. Many of the approaches on video analysis, select a random set of frames (or just a single frame) [5], and extract the features for them. There is another set of work on attention, that try to extracts the most important spatio-temporal [1-4] information to solve a certain task. These approaches are usually computationally less expensive than applying convnet on all video frames. I suggest the authors compare their model with these approaches.\u2028\n\n[1] Spatially Adaptive Computation Time for Residual Networks., Figurnov et al.\u2028\n[2] Recurrent Models of Visual Attention, Mnih et al.\n\u2028[3] Action recognition using visual attention, Sharma et al.\n\u2028[4] End-to-end learning of action detection from frame glimpses in videos, Yeung et al.\n\u2028[5] Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Action Recognition in Videos, Simonyan et al.\u2028\n\n- In addition, car and pedestrian detection performance is part of the evaluation process. In this case, the approach should be also compared to the state-of-the-art tracking approaches (that are cheaper to acquire) in terms of computational efficiency and performance. \n- The writing of the paper should also improve to make the paper more understandable and easier to follow.\u2028Some examples:\u20281.

The calculation of FLOPs of each layer is formulated as:\n           FLOPs = (C_i*(K^2))*H*W*C_o,\nwhere C_i and C_o represent the channel of input data and output feature map respectively. K^2 denotes the kernel size. H and W denote the height and width of output feature map.\n\nIn our implementation, we implement the FLOPs calculation by modifying the API CuDNNConvolutionLayer<Dtype>::Forward_gpu in the file caffe/src/caffe/layers/cudnn_conv_layer.cu provided from caffe framework. Once the API finish the convolution, the FLOPs can be calculated based on the above formula. On the other hand, the layer number can be determined through the current parameter in the API such as the channels of input data and kernel. \n\nSincerely,\nThe Authors"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper235/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper235/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper235/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DynCNN: An Effective Dynamic Architecture on Convolutional Neural Network for Surveillance Videos", "abstract": "The large-scale surveillance video analysis becomes important as the development of intelligent city.
