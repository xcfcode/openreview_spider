Also, this paper found that under constrained hyperparameter search budgets, the multi-agent PPO algorithm has more consistent performance over the other algorithms across different tested multi-agent environments. The code base is open-sourced for public use, which benefits the MARL community.\n\nResearchers in MARL often find it difficult to find a useful benchmark for multiagent learning algorithms and multiagent environments. Thus this paper makes a good contribution to the community, but, on the other hand, since this paper is not really intended to present any major technical contributions, that could be considered a weak point for an ICLR submission.\n\nTo the best of the reviewer's knowledge, there has not been any previous work that tries to produce a benchmark for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. As the first work that attempts to fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive implementation of popular MARL algorithms tested on a representative list of MA environments, which is the major reason for acceptance suggestion. But there are some limitations of this paper. For example, there is little discussion about the results and the authors did not attempt to do more technical investigation for understanding the their findings about the algorithms. In this sense, this paper is less than a qualified research paper.\nIn particular, it would be helpful if  the authors have any insight on why the MAPPO works more consistently than the other algorithms.\n\nOne major suggestion is to add standard deviation to the numeric values presented in Table 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\nIf this paper get accepted to this conference, peer researchers could be incentivized to contribute similarly comprehensive benchmark to this field, which would benefit the advancements of this field in the long run.    \n\nI have read over the rebuttal and discussion and will keep my evaluation score unchanged as I see value in benchmarking papers such as this for the community.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2501/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2501/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Benchmarking Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms", "authorids": ["yc19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "akashvelu@berkeley.edu", "~Eugene_Vinitsky1", "~Yu_Wang3", "~Alexandre_Bayen2", "~Yi_Wu1"], "authors": ["Chao Yu", "Akash Velu", "Eugene Vinitsky", "Yu Wang", "Alexandre Bayen", "Yi Wu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning", "Benchmarking"], "abstract": "We benchmark commonly used multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms on a variety of cooperative multi-agent games.

The paper compares standard algorithms alongside extensions of well-known policy gradient algorithms to the multi-agent setting, i.e. PPO (MAPPO), SAC (MASAC) and TD3 (MATD3). The paper investigates the ease of using an algorithm by doing a fair hyperparameter search for different algorithms. The paper concludes by saying that MAPPO is a promising choice for tackling a multi-agent problem. \n\nSuch a benchmarking paper would absolutely be useful. In its current form, however, it is not yet ready for publication. There are three primary reasons. First, the scope is misplaced: the paper starts with the scope of benchmarking different algorithms but seems to shift focus primarily to MAPPOs benefits. Second, the experiments only include 3 runs, with large overlapping deviations, limiting the ability to make claims about any significant differences. This is particularly problematic for a paper where the main focus is on experiments to provide insight. Finally, it seems like Pop-art is only used with MAPPO (please clarify this if I am mistaken), calling into question if the main reason for improvements in MAPPO is this choice. Reward scaling, done by Pop-art, can significantly affect learning performance as pointed out in Henderson et al. (2017). Using Pop-art only for MAPPO makes the comparison unfair between different approaches and potentially invalidates the conclusions presented in the paper.\n\nAs two other more minor points:\n\n1. Multi-agent methods are built around numerous agents learning separate policies. The choice of sharing the same weights (Page 4, Sec 3.3) among different policies doesn\u2019t seem to me like a fair choice. This also makes the algorithms different from their original intended use. \n\n2. There are several inconsistencies or questionable choices in the paper: \n\na. As per appendix, MADDP, MATD3, MASAC, QMix have gamma parameters, whereas there is no such parameter mentioned for MAPPO. Having a different gamma value for the methods essentially changes the problem.\n\nb. There is a difference between similar hyperparameters for different methods, i.e. MAPPO uses a gradient clipping of 20, whereas other methods use a gradient clipping of 10. How was this chosen and why is it different?\n\nc. Appendix (Hanabi), MAPPO uses a learning rate of 7e-4, whereas the learning rate is not mentioned as a value being tested in the search grid. \n\nd. MADDPG and MASAC are said to use a centralized critic, but according to Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, they seem to estimate separate critics. \n\ne. MASAC should have a tuple of three parameters (value functions, q function and policy), but Algorithm 2 talks about only two parameters (q function and policy). \n\n\nA few questions: \n1. In SMAC environments, why are MASAC, MATD3 and MADDPG not run for other settings (Table 2)? \n\n2. In MPE, I was not able to compare the results for MADDPG to the original paper. Can you point out the results (i.e. example the table number in Lowe et al. 2017)?  This also seems strange as Lowe et al. 2017 use a non-recurrent network with a different parameterization for each of the policies. In contrast, the current paper uses a recurrent network and shared policies, making the models quite different. \n\nSuggestions: \n1. Although the paper compares all the well-known policy gradient methods, comparing against a simple Vanilla Actor-Critic network would provide useful insight by removing some of the complexity.\n\n2. It would be good to include hyperparameters of PPO like the \\epsilon clipping.\n \n3. The graphs in Figure 3 do not have a visible axis.\n\n4. Including parameter sensitivity would provide much more insight into the properties of the algorithms,  and how they perform for general configuration of parameters. \n\n5. Section 3.1, P(s\u2019|s,u) : \\mathcal{S} \\times U \\times \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0,1], should have a U^n instead of U.  \n\nReferences\n1.

(2020). Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments. \n\n--- Update after reading the rebuttal and other reviews\n\nThough some concerns have been addressed, a critical issue remains unresolved, which is that the experiments use only 3 runs. \n\nAs an additional point, it is useful that you've identified MAPPO as a good multi-agent algorithm. However, for clarity, it is better to focus the paper around MAPPO rather than strictly calling it a benchmarking paper. Further, it would be good to clearly state in the paper that the results now include reward normalization.

We would like to respond to some of the highlighted issues, and clarify a few points:\n\n> \"As per appendix, MADDPG, MATD3, MASAC, QMix have gamma parameters, whereas there is no such parameter mentioned for MAPPO. Having a different gamma value for the methods essentially changes the problem.\"\n\nThank you for pointing this out - we use the same gamma discount factor (which is 0.99) for all experiments, and we have added this value for the MAPPO parameters in the appendix.\n> \" There is a difference between similar hyperparameters for different methods, i.e. MAPPO uses a gradient clipping of 20, whereas other methods use a gradient clipping of 10. How was this chosen and why is it different?\": \n\nWe chose gradient clipping of 10 because this was the value used in the original QMix paper; to maintain consistency, we have rerun MAPPO experiments with a gradient clip value of 10 and have updated results, which remain largely unchanged.\n\n> \"Appendix (Hanabi), MAPPO uses a learning rate of 7e-4, whereas the learning rate is not mentioned as a value being tested in the search grid.\"\n\nThank you for pointing this out - we have added the learning rate search details in the appendix now. \n\n> \"MADDPG and MASAC are said to use a centralized critic, but according to Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, they seem to estimate separate critics\"\n\nThese algorithms use centralized critics in that the critics take as input both the centralized/global state and all agents' actions. In a shared policy setting (which is the case for nearly all experiments), all agents share the same critic, but in an unshared policy setting, each agent will have its own associated critic (which still takes as input global information).\n> \"MASAC should have a tuple of three parameters (value functions, q function and policy), but Algorithm 2 talks about only two parameters (q function and policy).\"\n\nOur implementation of MASAC is built off of the SAC algorithm in Haarnoja Et. Al, 2016, which utilizes only policy and Q function networks. \n> \"In SMAC environments, why are MASAC, MATD3 and MADDPG not run for other settings (Table 2)\"\n\nIn the previous version of our paper, due to the lack of success of MASAC, MATD3, and MADDPG in fairly easy tasks, we did not run them on harder maps. We now have run experiments with MASAC, MATD3, and MADDPG on all maps and have updated the results in these tables with these updated values - the trend continues to be that these algorithms have little success in these harder tasks. \n> \"In MPE, I was not able to compare the results for MADDPG to the original paper. \"\n\nThe MADDPG paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275) unfortunately does not include comprehensive results for all multiagent particle env tasks, such as simple_reference. Furthermore, they use normalized scores in the paper. - However, Figure 4 shows the training curve on speaker-listener, which we reproduce with our implementation.\n\nThis also seems strange as Lowe et al. 2017 use a non-recurrent network with a different parameterization for each of the policies. In contrast, the current paper uses a recurrent network and shared policies, making the models quite different.\n\nIt is true that the original MADDPG algorithms were implemented with MLP networks and unshared policies; however, we use recurrent networks for two reasons: first, all environments are partially observed with the exception of the MPE environment - thus, algorithms benefit from using recurrent networks, as they are able to carry forward observation history. Second, the original implementation of QMix utilizes recurrent networks - hence, for consistency across algorithms, each algorithm utilizes recurrent networks. We utilize shared policies for the same reason - in all environments except for the speaker-listener MPE environment, agents are homogenous, allowing for reasonable use of shared policies. Furthermore, the original QMix paper shares policies across agents, so for consistency, we use shared policies for all algorithms when possible.  \n\n> \"The scope is misplaced: the paper starts with the scope of benchmarking different algorithms but seems to shift focus primarily to MAPPOs benefits. \n\nWe benchmark each algorithm by giving each a hyperparameter search space of equal size, and evaluating their performance on each testing environment. We ultimately find that MAPPO is the strongest, and due to the clear success of MAPPO compared to the other algorithms, we emphasize it's strengths, particularly because the promise and benefits of multi-agent PPO are largely ignored in the literature. \n> \"It seems like Pop-art is only used with MAPPO (please clarify this if I am mistaken), calling into question if the main reason for improvements in MAPPO is this choice. \"\n\nWe have added reward-normalization to our off policy algorithm results , which do not affect our results significantly. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2501/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2501/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Benchmarking Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms", "authorids": ["yc19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "akashvelu@berkeley.edu", "~Eugene_Vinitsky1", "~Yu_Wang3", "~Alexandre_Bayen2", "~Yi_Wu1"], "authors": ["Chao Yu", "Akash Velu", "Eugene Vinitsky", "Yu Wang", "Alexandre Bayen", "Yi Wu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning", "Benchmarking"], "abstract": "We benchmark commonly used multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms on a variety of cooperative multi-agent games.

MAAC demonstrates the utility of attention in multi-agent RL, and thus is not a separate algorithm per-say, which is why we did not include it on our benchmark. \n\n> Q2:That the author can adjust the content of the paper, and don't make people feel that the author has collected different official implementations, and then simply run them and compare directly.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this suggestion. However, we would like to emphasize that there is no existing unified, open-source implementation of various MARL algorithms, and no benchmarks or implementations in particular of MAPPO, MATD3, and MASAC. Furthermore, there are no benchmarks or implementations, with the exception of QMix, of recurrent variants of these algorithms, which we believe is a significant aspect of our results and work. Given the lack of benchmarks for MAPPO, its high performance is particularly noteworthy, which we believe to be an important aspect of this paper. \n\n> \"I suggest that the author conduct further analysis and experiments, and also pay attention to the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithms.e that the author can adjust the content of the paper, and don't make people feel that the author has collected different official implementations, and then simply run them and compare directly.\"\n\nThank you for the suggestion - we would like to point out that the results presented in our paper demonstrate the strength and robustness of MAPPO across domains, achieving comparable state of the art results in the Starcraft II domain and outperforming other popular algorithms in all other domains. This finding is significant to the community due to the fact that MAPPO is largely undervalued in MARL. To further investigate these findings, we plan to conduct further ablation studies.

A limited budget of hyperparameter tuning is applied to each algorithm in order to give each one a chance at good performance, and a clear winner emerges for consistent strong performance across tasks.\n\n## Quality & Clarity\nThe paper is presented according to a high standard of quality. They document and explain their methods clearly, including hyperparameters. They have clean descriptions of each algorithm and easily readable text.\n\nNit: for table 2, it would be easier to read if top scores (or, top scores within stdev) were bolded.\nNit: for table 3 with 2 players and possibly for table 4, it might be better to report results using a graph as this will show the progress that each algorithm made and document where they were cut off. This could even just be in the appendix.\nNit: you use box-locking-easy and box-locking-simple interchangeably--best remove one.\n\n## Originality\nI\u2019m not aware of other work which provides as clean a comparison of both different tasks and different methods, so there is novelty in the open source benchmark that this provides. The work contains some original tasks built on top of existing ones (i.e. in the Hide and Seek domain). There are no original algorithms in this paper as it is not the focus of the work.\n\n## Significance\nFrom the conclusion:\n> \u201cGiven access to equally sized compute budgets for hyperparameter optimization, MAPPO is the most consistently successful algorithm across the studied environments, performing well at SMAC, as well as any algorithm in the MPEs and the best in hide-and-seek and Hanabi-small. Surprisingly, we also find that the centralized Q function variants DDPG, SAC, and TD3 almost entirely fail to solve any of the studied tasks, particularly in slightly harder environments.\u201d\n\nThe main conclusion of the paper is \u201cMAPPO is a good starting point for tackling new MARL problems\u201d. This is a useful practical tip for researchers in the field. However, the work provides little insight into why that is the case. The next lines of the conclusion confirm that:\n\n> \u201cOf course, these results are likely dependent on the choice of hyperparameters and architectural choices. Thus it may be the case that the initial point around which we perform our grid search for MA-DDPG/TD3/SAC does not contain any good solutions and that performance of a set of hyperparameters on the MPEs is not predictive of performance in other domains. Finding a better set of hyper-parameters over which to search for the off policy algorithms is an important direction for future work.\u201d\n\nThe authors admit that they were only able to explore a limited space of hyperparameters and their work may not hold in other circumstances. There is plenty of room for continued exploration of hyperparameters, certainly, but even more valuable would be any indicators into why different techniques might have different performance on the different tasks. I think in order for the publication to get accepted to a conference like ICLR it likely needs a bit more investigation, though researchers may certainly find the benchmark useful in research.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2501/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2501/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Benchmarking Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms", "authorids": ["yc19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "akashvelu@berkeley.edu", "~Eugene_Vinitsky1", "~Yu_Wang3", "~Alexandre_Bayen2", "~Yi_Wu1"], "authors": ["Chao Yu", "Akash Velu", "Eugene Vinitsky", "Yu Wang", "Alexandre Bayen", "Yi Wu"], "keywords": ["Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning", "Benchmarking"], "abstract": "We benchmark commonly used multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms on a variety of cooperative multi-agent games.

The author's writing and organization are very good, so that I can clearly understand the content of the paper, and also has certain highlights, but I think it has not reached the ICLR criteria.\n\nFirst of all, as an article about BENCHMARKING MULTI-AGENT DEEP REINFORCE- MENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS, I think the author should compare a series of algorithms to bring more insightful analysis and inspiration. Unfortunately, I found that the author simply I enumerate the performance differences of different algorithms in different environments, and there is also a lack of analysis of what methods are suitable for what tasks. I suggest that the author conduct further analysis and experiments, and also pay attention to the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithms. I hope that the author can adjust the content of the paper, and don't make people feel that the author has collected different official implementations, and then simply run them and compare directly.\n\nIn addition, I think the author may be missing some important MARL algorithms. For example, in terms of policy-base, it is recommended that the author consider adding algorithms such as COMA[1] and MAAC[2] (the authors of these algorithms have already announced their official implementations). At the same time, most of the author's algorithms have official implementations on the Internet. How to compare different algorithms fairly is of great concern, but the author's content is still relatively weak, and the author is recommended to improve this part of the discussion.\n\nOverall, I vote for a rejection\n\n[1] Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients, Foerster et.al.
