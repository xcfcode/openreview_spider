The method achieves state of the art on FB15k-237, WN18RR and Countries benchmark knowledge bases. I think this will be interesting to the ICLR community. I particularly enjoyed the analysis of existing methods regarding the expressiveness of relational patterns mentioned above.\n\n# Strengths\n- Improvements over prior neural link prediction methods\n- Clearly written paper\n- Interesting analysis of existing neural link prediction methods\n\n# Weaknesses\n- As the authors not only propose a new scoring function for neural link prediction but also an adversarial sampling mechanism for negative data, I believe a more careful ablation study should have been carried out. There is an ablation study showing the impact of the negative sampling on the baseline TransE, as well as another ablation in the appendix demonstrating the impact of negative sampling on TransE and the proposed method, RotatE, for the FB15k-237. However, from Table 10 in the appendix, one can see that the two competing methods, TransE and RotatE, in fact, perform fairly similarly once both use adversarial sampling it still remains unclear whether the gains observed in table 4 and 5 are due to adversarial sampling or a better scoring function. Particularly, I want to see results of a stronger baseline, ComplEx, equipped with the adversarial sampling approach. Ideally, I would also like to see multiple repeats of the experiments to get a sense of the variance of the results (as it has been done for Countries in Table 6).\n\n# Minor Comments\n- Eq 5: Already introduce gamma (the fixed margin) here.\n- While I understand that this paper focuses on knowledge graph embeddings, I believe the large body of other relational AI approaches should be mention as some of them can also model symmetry, anti-symmetry, inversion and composition patterns of relations as well (though they might be less scalable and therefore of less practical relevance), e.g. the following come to mind:\n  - Lao et al.

Taking a 1-to-N relation r as an example. The triplets having the head entity x and relation r are denoted as: r(x, y1), r(x, y2) \u2026. r(x, yn). When the optimization converges, it could be easily to find out that the embeddings of y1, y2, \u2026, yn will be evenly distributed on the surface of a hypercube (or a hypersphere in the case of L-2 norm) centered at rx. In other words, ||rx - y1|| = ||rx - y2|| = .. = ||rx - yn||. This phenomenon is the same as in semantic matching models, like ComplEx, where the scores <r,x,\\bar{y1}>=<r,x,\\bar{y2}>=..=<r,x,\\bar{yn}>. Therefore, the RotatE model can somehow deal with 1-to-N relations just like ComplEx, as well as TransE.\n\nA more elegant and rigorous approach to model the 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations is to leverage a probabilistic framework to model the uncertainties of the entities, where each predicted entity is represented as a Gaussian distribution. This has been proved quite effective in [1]. Our RotatE model can easily leverage this framework to mitigate this issue. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the focus of this paper is to model and infer the different types of relation patterns, but not the 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relationships. However, we will conduct further experiments to compare the performance of different methods (TransE, ComplEx and RotatE) on the 1-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relationships. \n\n[1] Shizhu He, Kang Liu, Guoliang Ji and Jun Zhao, Learning to Represent Knowledge Graphs with Gaussian Embedding\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links.

The difference between RotatE and ComplEx can be summarized as follows:\n\n(1)ComplEx belongs to the semantic matching model while RotatE belongs to the distance-based model. Most of existing knowledge graph embedding models can be roughly classified into two categories: Translational(Transformational) Distance Models and Semantic Matching Models [1]. The former measure the plausibility of a fact as a translation(transformation) between two entities, while the latter measure the plausibility of facts by matching latent semantics of entities and relations. RotatE and ComplEx are in different categories. Actually, we can find that the relation between ComplEx and RotatE is in analogy to the relation between TransF [2] and TransE, where the former can be regarded as a slack version of the latter.\n\n(2) As a result, the biggest difference between ComplEx and RotatE addressed in this paper is that, the RotatE model can infer the composition pattern of relations, while the ComplEx model cannot. A simple counterexample could illustrate this point.\n\nLet\u2019s assume r1(x, y), r2(y, z) and r3(x, z) hold, and then according to ComplEx we have\n\nRe(<r1, x, \\bar{y}>)  >  Re(<r1, x\u2019, \\bar{y\u2019}>)\nRe(<r2, y, \\bar{z}>)  >  Re(<r2, y\u2019, \\bar{z\u2019}>)\nRe(<r3, x, \\bar{z}>)  >  Re(<r3, x\u2019, \\bar{z\u2019}>)\n\nwhere r1(x\u2019, y\u2019), r2(y\u2019,z\u2019) and r3(x\u2019, z\u2019) are negative triplets.\n\nFrom the above equations, we can find that the ComplEx model does not model a bijection mapping from h to t via relation r.  For example, let x=-1+i, y=1, z=1+i, r1=-1-0.8i, r2= 0.2+i, r3=-0.8-i, we have r1(x, y), r2(y, z) and r3(x, z) hold, because\n\n<r1, x, \\bar{y}> = 1.8 -  0.2i\n<r2, y, \\bar{z}> = 1.2 + 0.8i\n<r3, x, \\bar{z}> = 2 - 1.6i\n\nHowever, r1 * r2 = 0.6 - 1.16i, r3= - 0.8 - i do not show the supposed pattern r1 \\circ r2 = \\alpha r3 here.\n\nAs for the comparison with TransE, the rotation in the RotatE model is in the complex plane of each embedding vector element, as the same as TransE. This is different from the rotation is in the whole embedding space by matrix multiplication.\n\n\u201cAbout experiments, for fair comparisons, results should be reported on common and standard settings, especially with and without new negative sampling method\u2026.\u201d\n\nWe have added the results of TransE and ComplEx with the new adversarial negative sampling technique on three datasets in Table 8. \n\n\u201cThe authors should also address how they estimate/or approximate the softmax in Equation 4 of negative sampling method to scale to large datasets, because it is very costly due to the normalization term. ...\u201d\n\np(h\u2019_j , r, t\u2019_j |{(h_i , r_i , t_i)}) is defined as the probability that we sample (h\u2019_j , r, t\u2019_j) from a sampled set {(h_i , r_i , t_i)}, so we calculate the softmax function only on the sampled triplets. This is very efficient.\n\n\u201c It's also not clear what $ f_r $ refers to in Equation 4.\u201d\n\n $f_r$ is the score function introduced in Table 1, which equals to $- d_r$.\n\n[1]  Knowledge Graph Embedding: A Survey of Approaches and Applications\n[2]  Knowledge graph embedding by flexible translation\f"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links.

In other words, in this case MRR = 1, which is definitely wrong.\n\nMoreover, as mentioned in [2], we have fixed the bug in your previous codes and reported the true performance of your model on FB15k-237. We provided the checkpoint file, where you can check that MRR = 40 by your original eval.py, but 24 by our bug-fixed eval.py.\n\nAs for your updated codes, we suggest that you should replace the \u201crankdata\u201d part by:\n\nresults_with_id = rankdata(results, method=\u2019ordinal\u2019)\n\nwhere \u2018ordinal\u2019 represents \u201cAll values are given a distinct rank, corresponding to the order that the values occur in a.\u201d  according to the official document [1].

We have added the experimental results of TransE and ComplEx with self-adversarial negative sampling on three datasets in our paper (Table 8). We have also added the contribution of the self-adversarial negative sampling into both the abstract and introduction.\n\nRegarding TorusE, thanks again for bringing it to our attention, which we did not notice before. It is indeed relevant to our model, which is a concurrent work. We have discussed this model in the related work section. The difference between TorusE and RotatE can be summarized as below:\n\n(1) The TorusE model constraints the embedding of objects on a torus, and models relations as translations, while the RotatE model embeds objects on the entire complex vector space, and models relations as rotations.\n\n(2) The TorusE model requires embedding objects on a compact Lie group [2] while the RotatE model allows embedding objects on a non-compact Lie group, which has much more representation capacity. The TorusE model is actually very close to a special case of our model, i.e., pRotatE, which constraints the modulus of the head and entity embeddings fixed. As shown in Table 5, it is very important for modeling and inferring the composition patterns by embedding the entities on a non-compact Lie group. We can also compare the results of TorusE and RotatE on the FB15k and WN18 data sets (Table 3 in the TorusE paper and Table 4 in our paper), we can see that our RotatE model significantly outperforms TorusE on the two data sets.\n\n(3) The motivations of the TorusE paper and this paper are quite different. The TorusE paper aims to solve the regularization problem of TransE, while our paper focuses on inferring and modeling three important and popular relation patterns.\n\n[1] Ebisu, Takuma, and Ryutaro Ichise. \"Toruse: Knowledge graph embedding on a lie group.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05435 (2017).\"\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_group#Compact_Lie_groups"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links.

But, it also raises attention to some important issues that need to be addressed.\n\nThe proposed model is very similar to the ComplEx embedding model [1]. In fact, in the ComplEx model, the score function is $ real(<r, h, \\bar{t}>) $, which includes the element-wise product between $ r \\circ h $. Because the ComplEx model uses complex-value embeddings, this product is essentially rotation in the complex plane, thus the same as the idea in this paper.\n\nThe authors should clarify and emphasize how their model could provide advantage over the ComplEx model, which is currently one of the SOTA. The authors should provide convincing theoretical arguments because many researches have shown that excessive hyper-parameter tuning and optimization techniques can change benchmark results a lot [2]. The authors also need to provide proof that the ComplEx model cannot model \"composition\" as in Table 2, given the two models are essentially similar.\n\nAdditionally, the comparison with TransE is ambiguous. The authors should make clear that the rotation is in the complex plane of each embedding vector element, thus different from rotation in the embedding space; and check that their arguments and analyses regarding TransE still stand.\n\nAbout experiments, for fair comparisons, results should be reported on common and standard settings.

Another contribution is the so-called self-adversarial negative sampling.\n\nPros:  The problem that they raise is important and the solution is relevant. The results considering the simplicity of the proposed model are impressive. The experiments, proof of lemmas and general overview are easy to follow, well-written and well-organized.  The improvement given the negative sampling approach is also noteworthy.\n\nCons: Nevertheless, this approach is very similar to TorusE [1], since the element-wise rotation on the complex plane is somehow related to transformation on high-dimensional Torus. Therefore, it is expected from the authors to investigate the differences between these two approaches.\n\nSuggestions:\nAlso, it is important to note the result of ablation study on Table 10 in supplementary materials, since part of the improvement does not come only from how the authors model the relation but also from the negative sampling(which could improve the results of other works as well). Maybe it is even better if Table 10 is presented in the main paper. \nAnother suggestion is to mention the negative sampling contribution also in the abstract.\n\n\n[1] Ebisu, Takuma, and Ryutaro Ichise. \"Toruse: Knowledge graph embedding on a lie group.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05435 (2017).\"\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links.

Last year, I verified my \u201ceval.py\u201d implementation by using the same output vector and matrix embeddings produced by other models (such as TransE, TransR, TransH and STransE) to prove that our \"eval.py\" implementation is correct and can produce the exact same scores as produced by those models. \n\nFor each correct test triple, I just replicated this correct test triple several times to add to its set of corrupted triples, in order to work with a batch size (as shown in Lines 188-190 in \u201ceval.py\u201d). This is straightforward and does not matter when ranking the correct test triple. I thought that \"the same score\" you mentioned is actually for the correct test triple because of replicating.

We\u2019re aware of the result of ConvKB, which achieves a very high MRR on FB15k (0.396). The reason that we did compare with ConvKB [1] is that there is a bug in ConvKB\u2019s evaluation.\n\nWe tried to reproduce their results from their published code [2], but found that the ConvKB tends to assign the same score, i.e., 0,  to many triplets. The reason is that the RELU activation function is used in the convolution layers, which tends to have very sparse output, i.e., the output of many neurons are zero. This brings a big problem in the evaluation.\n\nFor evaluation, given a query (h,r, ?), the goals is to identify the rank of the true positive triplets (h, r, t) among all the possible (h, r, t\u2019) triplets. Since the scores of many triplets given by ConvKB equal to 0 (typo, should be \"the same score\" or \"bias\"), the true positive triplets and many other false triplets are all ranked the first position at the same time. A reasonable solution would be to randomly pick a triplet among those triplets as the first ranked triplet, and so on. However,  we find that a specific ranking procedure is used by ConvKB, which tends to rank the true positive triplets in a high position. As a result, the performance evaluated in this way is really high, which is not true in reality. We strongly suggest the authors of ConvKB to take a look at this issue and fix their results.\n\nFor the results of Reciprocal ComplEx-N3, thanks again for pointing this out, which we are not aware of before the submission. However, note that the focus of the Reciprocal ComplEx-N3 and this paper is different. Our paper proposes a new distance function for learning knowledge graph embedding, and our proposed RotatE is able to infer three relation patterns including composition, symmetry/asymmetry, and inversion, which offers good model interpretability. The focus of Reciprocal ComplEx-N3, however, is on different regularization techniques, which could be potentially applied to our proposed RotatE model. For example, on the FB15k data set, the performance of RotatE increases from 0.797 to 0.815 with the N3-regularizer, which outperforms  the performance of ComplEx-N3 on FB15k (0.80).  We are still in the process of implementing the reciprocal setting for our RotatE model, which seems to be pretty effective according to [3]. \n\n[1] A Novel Embedding Model for Knowledge Base Completion Based on Convolutional Neural Network\n[2] https://github.com/daiquocnguyen/ConvKB\n[3] Canonical Tensor Decomposition for Knowledge Base Completion\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1347/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RotatE: Knowledge Graph Embedding by Relational Rotation in Complex Space", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs for predicting missing links.
