AR2 is concerned with the lack of any concrete toy example between the proposed architecture and RNNs.

AR3 is the most critical (the analysis TT-RNN based on the product non-linearity done before, particular case of rectifier non-linearity is used, etc.)\n\nDespite the authors cannot guarantee the existence of corresponding weight tensor W in less trivial cases, the overall analysis is very interesting and it is the starting point for further modeling.

Also, please see the answers to the raised questions.\n\n1. In our analysis, the data is initially represented as a matrix (collection of vectors). This representation is later translated into rank 1 canonical tensor \\Phi. In its simplest form (multiplicative) the model can be written as <W, \\Phi>, where W is the weight tensor. As was shown in [1], TT decomposition of W leads to the recurrent architecture. In our analysis, we move further from this representation directly to RNNs with ReLU nonlinearity, and show that this model corresponds to the ReLU-TT decomposition of the \u201cgrid tensor\u201d, containing values of the model samples on a certain tensor product grid.\n\n2. In order to map vanilla RNN to our model we need to redefine two things:\n1) Trainable weights. In the case of vanilla RNN without any nonlinearity and hidden state equation h_t = A*h_{t-1} + B*x_t + c, the weights are two matrices A and B and the vector c. In the case of our model, the weights are 3-dimensional TT-cores G_t (equation 11) or a single TT-core G (equation 12) if we set all of them to be equal.\n2) Equation for hidden state. Equations 10, 12, and 16 provide us with concrete formulas for calculating hidden states for different models. We just need to plug them in instead of corresponding formula for vanilla RNN.\nTo implement our models in practice we took the original code of TensorFlow RNN Cell, redefined trainable weights, and changed the expression for hidden state computation.\n\n[1] V.

We hope that following comments will help to resolve your questions.\n\n1. The approximation function is l(X) and it approximates functions F: \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times T} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}. An example of such function F is a probability that given sequence X corresponds to a particular class.\n\n2. The connection with Tensor Ring format is an appealing direction for future research. We have not investigated this connection yet, but here are some thoughts on your comments.  In particular, incorporating the circular dimensional permutation invariance property into neural networks may provide insights into how to design new types of RNNs. It would be also interesting to look at the distribution of lower bounds on the rank of TR-based tensor models (in analogy to Figure 3), as evenly distributed rank bounds may give better results than less balanced TT.\n\n3. It is indeed the case \u2014 we will overfit if we increase the number of parameters. However, the purpose of the Figure 2 is to show that in the case of ReLU nonlinearity, TT-based generalized tensor models are more expressive than CP-based models. We believe that Figure 2 is a good illustration to this phenomena even within a current range of parameters number.\n\n4. By \u201clogits\u201d we mean immediate outputs of the last hidden layer before applying nonlinearity. This term is adopted from classification tasks where neural network usually outputs \u201clogits\u201d and following softmax nonlinearity transforms them into valid probabilities of classes. Note that the theory supports arbitrary number of classes: we just need to approximate logit for each class with our model and then apply sigmoid nonlinearity to get a valid classifier.\n\n5.

Please, see the answers to your questions below.\n\n1. The detailed proof we provide in the paper indeed refers to the ReLU nonlinearity only. Due to the constructive nature of our proof, it is not easily generalized to the arbitrary associative and commutative binary operator, and we highly doubt that it will work in general. However, even without solid theoretical justification, we can implement generalized tensor networks with various nonlinearities and compare them empirically, which we do in Section B of the appendix. As we can see, the right choice of nonlinearity for particular dataset may lead to boost in the performance and it will be interesting direction of research to analyze them more rigorously from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.\n\n2. Before introducing the concept of generalized tensor networks, we had full correspondence between the score functions of scalar product form (equation 2) and the score functions of tensor decomposition form (equations 6 and 8). It ensures that tensor networks are universal function approximators and allows us to focus on another important properties, such as expressivity. However, after replacing the outer product with different operator and declaring the expressions from equations 14 and 16 to be the score functions, we can no longer state that they can be represented in a form of equation 2. Specifically, we can no longer guarantee the existence of corresponding weight tensor W (and, thus, universality), the existence of which was trivial in the case of standard tensor networks with multiplicative nonlinearity.\n\n3. The use of template vectors is motivated by the discussion in [1]. In order to be able to achieve zero classification error for the model under analysis, the data has to satisfy two assumptions: label has to be completely determined by the instance, and the input vectors may be quantized into one of the M templates. The assumption that natural images possess these properties is based on various empirical studies. For example, it was shown in [2] that small image patches of sizes 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, and so on, can be effectively modeled by a GMM of size 64. We believe that similar properties also hold for sequential data appearing in NLP tasks, however, this assumption requires further investigation.\n\n[1] N. Cohen, O. Sharir, A. Shashua.

However, I found that some deep concepts are not well introduced, and maybe other more trivial results are discussed with unnecessary details. The following comments could help authors to improve the quality of presentation of their paper:\n-\tSection 3.1 (Score Functions and Feature Tensor) is a bit short and difficult to read. \no\tMaybe, a more motivating introduction could be included in order to justify the definition of score functions (eq. 2). \no\tIt would be also nice to state that, according to eq. (3), the feature tensor is a rank-1 tensor. \no\tI would suggest moving the definition of outer product to the Appendix, since most readers know it very well.\no\tIt is said that eq. 2 possesses the universal approximation property (it can approximate any function with any prescribed precision given sufficiently large M). It is not clear which is the approximation function.\n-\tA Connection with Tensor-Ring (TR) format, if possible, could be helpful: It is known that TR format (Zhao et al, 2016, arXiv:1606.05535), which is obtained by connecting the first and last units in a TT model, helps to alleviate the requirement of large ranks in the first and last the core tensors of a TT model reaching to a decomposition with an evenly distributed rank bounds. I think, it would be interesting to make a connection of RNN to TR because the assumption of R_i < R for all i becomes more natural. I would like to see at least some comment from the authors about the applicability of TR in the context of analysis of RNN, if possible. Maybe, also the initial hidden state defined in page 5 can be avoided if TR is used instead of TT.\n-\tFig 2 shows that Test accuracy of a shallow network (CP based) is lower and increases with the number of parameters approaching to the one for RNN (TT based). It would be necessary to show the results for an extended range in the number of parameters, for example, by plotting the results up to 10^6. It is expected that, at some point, the effect of overfitting start decreasing the test accuracy.\n-       When scores functions are presented (eq. 2) it is written the term \"logits\" between brackets. Could you please clarify why this term is introduced here? Usually, logit of a probability p is defined as L(p)=p/(1-p). What is the usage of this term in this work? \n-      I think the theory is presented for a model with the two-classes only but used for multiple classes in the experimental sections. It should be necessary to make some comment about this in the paper.\n-      Details about how the RNN based on TT is applied must be added. More specifically, the authors should provide answers to clarify the following questions: \n(i) Are patches overlapped or non-overlapped? \n(ii) What value of M is used? and is there any general rule for this choice? \n(iii) How the classification in the 10-classes is obtained? Are you using a softmax function in the last layer? Are you using one weight tensor W_c per class (c=1,2,...,10). Please provide these technical details. \n(iv) Please, specify which nonlinear activation sigma is used in the feature map f_\\theta(x).\n(v) How many feature maps are used? and, Are the matrix A and vector b learned from training dataset or only the TT-cores need to be learned?

However, this observed efficiency is not yet entirely explained by theory. It is known that a certain class of multiplicative RNNs enjoys the property of depth efficiency --- a shallow network of exponentially large width is necessary to realize the same score function as computed by such an RNN. Such networks, however, are not very often applied to real life tasks. In this work, we attempt to reduce the gap between theory and practice by extending the theoretical analysis to RNNs which employ various nonlinearities, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and show that they also benefit from properties of universality and depth efficiency.
