Applying an RNN to disease diagnosis, medication prescription and timing prediction.\n\n2. \"Initializing\" the neural net with skipgrams instead of one-hot vectors. However, it seems from the description that the authors are not \"initializing\", rather just feeding a different feature vector into the RNN.\n\n3. Initializing a model that is to be trained on a small corpus from a model trained on a large corpus works. Concludes: information can be transferred between models (read across hospitals).\n\nClaims:\n1. Better recall @10 and @30 on the task.\n2. Improved speed due to the skipgram initialization (I'm assuming this is convergence speed)\n\nWhat I like about this paper:\n1. Well written.\n2. It's a neat application. Practically minded and the conclusions would have practical consequences.\n\nWhat I think can be improved:\n1. More thorough experiments, comparisons to continuous time markov chain models and intensity point processes.\n2. More detailed results: I would like to have a better view of the data, in particular, I would like an explanation for why \"most freq visits\" is performing so well.\n3. A clearer description of the problem. For instance, the authors suggest that continuous time Markov models were used for similar tasks, but it seems like their task is discrete time.

The current two main classes of techniques used to solve the task are continuous-time Markov chain based models and intensity based point process modeling. The work presented in this paper distinguishes itself from these approaches by proposing a solution that is straightforward to generalize to nonlinear and multilabel settings and does not make assumptions about the data generation process.\n\nThe paper makes three main contributions:\n\n* It claims to obtain good performance for recall @10 and @30 on the task.\n* It proposes an efficient initialization scheme for RNNs using Skip-gram embedding, which improves accuracy and speed. (Note: it is unclear to me what speed means in this context; is it convergence speed?)\n* It shows that the features learned by the model are useful in a transfer learning context, where the trained model is used to initialize a model trained on a smaller dataset coming from a different health institution.\n\nThe task is clearly explained and contextualized, and the real-world benefits (facilitate patient-specific care and timely intervention, reduce healthcare cost) are well justified. The main contributions are well outlined.\n\nThe paper claims that the model performs with similar accuracy to physicians, but doesn't seem to present evidence to back it up. From an outsider's perspective, I wonder why recall is the only performance measure considered. Aren't we also interested in reducing false positives? Still from an outsider's perspective, it's hard to evaluate how high of a bar the other baselines represent. It doesn't seem like any comparison is made with current approaches to solving multilabel marked point process modeling tasks.\n\nIn summary:\n\n+ Well written\n+ Concrete real-world applicability\n+ Application of RNNs to a new class of problems\n+ Task clearly explained and well contextualized\n- Claim that the model performs with similar accuracy to physicians does not appear to be backed up by evidence\n- Does not appear to compare against current approaches to solving the task\n- Unclear whether the performance results are for the training set or for a held-out test set\n\nI think that the work presented in this paper is novel and interesting enough that it should be accepted, despite the concerns I have with the performance measures.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"CMT_id": "", "title": "Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Large amount of  Electronic Health Record (EHR) data have been collected over millions of patients over multiple years.
