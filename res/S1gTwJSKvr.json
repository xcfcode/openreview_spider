However, we would like to note that, the comments would be more helpful if were posted before the end of discussion period to find a constructive solution.\n\nComment 1: (\"the authors should explicitly state in the paper that the optimality is in terms of what...\")\nThe optimality refers to the least squares solution of quantization of isolated tensors (both weights and activations). It is mentioned at the beginning of page 4 (Section 3) in the paper: \u201cAll optimal solutions are with respect to this error and hold for an arbitrary distribution p(x). \u201d\n\nSimultaneous quantization of all layers , or loss aware quantization techniques may result in better model accuracy compared to independent quantization. However, In this paper we study the effect of quantization error in isolation and propose provably optimal (in L2 sense) 2-bits Xnor quantization.\n\nComment 2: (\"... it is not appropriate to formulate quantization error the weights and activations in the format of continuous distribution...\")\nWe respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The number of weights and activations for networks of interests (e.g., resnet18) are statistically large, make the continuous approximation accurate enough. We have verified this by sub-sampling tensors (i.e., use a fraction of values in a tensor instead of all its elements) and observe negligible change in the resulted statistics. Moreover, as mentioned in the paper continuous notation is used only for ease of derivation and explanation of the methodologies.\n\nComment 3: (\"It is also not clear to me why this paper begins with rank-1 quantization...\")\nPlease see our answer to Reviewer 2 regarding this question.  \n\nComment 4: (\"One of my main concerns is the novelty of this paper...\")\nThe main novelty of the paper is on rank-1 analysis and optimal 2-bits quantization solution. The optimal 1-bit quantization is provided for completeness, and optimal ternary is mentioned as a specific case of 2-bits quantization. We thank the reviewer to point to [2], which unfortunately we missed in our previous works review. As the reviewer mentioned, in [2] the optimal ternary quantization is obtained when Hessian is replaced by scalar times identity matrix; similarly, we obtain optimal ternary quantization when add a constraint on scaling factors in our general 2-bits solution: v1 and v2 to be equal.\n\nComment 5: (\"Yet another concern is about the experiments...\")\nThe performance boost in our implementation of BWN comes from using full precision short-cuts. It is mentioned in Appendix E in training details.\n\nPACT uses uniform quantization with 2-bits for weights and activations. In this paper we focus on networks with binary weights, 1-bit per value (therefore maximum size compression), and improve model accuracy by reducing the quantization error of  activations. Hence, results are not directly comparable. Please note that the adaptive clipping mechanism introduced in PACT is orthogonal to our optimal quantization techniques and could be used together.\n\nWe propose provably optimal 2-bits quantization and support optimality of the method empirically as well. The final accuracy depends on other factors as well (e.g., learning rate schedule and batchsize as shown in Table 2), that we did not tune for. LQ-Net provides a suboptimal solution to the optimization problem that we solve in this paper.  Few other differences: LQ-Net uses quantization with {0,1} encoding for activations and {-1,1} for weights (while we use {-1,1} for both), and uses a different order of operations in a layer for network than Xnor-Net (that we adopted in this paper). Our final accuracy results for ImageNet-ResNet18 are close (62.4% vs 62.6%)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1783/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1783/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "OPTIMAL BINARY QUANTIZATION FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Hadi Pouransari", "Oncel Tuzel"], "authorids": ["mpouransari@apple.com", "onceltuzel@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Binary Neural Networks", "Quantization"], "abstract": "Quantizing weights and activations of deep neural networks results in significant improvement in inference efficiency at the cost of lower accuracy.

The authors propose solutions for optimal 1-bit/ternary/2-bit quantization, as well as a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal k-bit quantization.  Experiments are performed on image classification data set ImageNet using ResNet-18.\n\nFirst of all, the authors should explicitly state in the paper that the optimality is in terms of what?  Indeed the authors obtain the solution of (1) quantization with a scaling parameter, and (2) in terms of minimizing quantization error (L_2 loss between the quantized value and the full-precision one), which is quite restricted to be a universally optimal one.\n\nSince the number of weights and activations are limited in the network, it is not appropriate to formulate quantization error the weights and activations in the format of continuous distribution in (4) and (8). \n\nIt is also not clear to me why this paper begins with rank-1 quantization but ends up with scaled quantization. What kind of assumption are used in this approximation, and can the optimality still be guaranteed?\n\nOne of my main concerns is the novelty of this paper. Many of the solutions in the paper have already been discovered in literature. For instance, the optimal 1-bit solution in (5) was already obtained in Binary-Weight-Network [1] in 2016. The optimal ternary solution (i.e., the ternarization threshold should be 1/2 of the scaling parameter) in (12)  was also already obtained in Corollary 3.1 in  [2] in 2018, as a special case when curvature information is dropped.\n\nYet another concern is about the experiments. Since the proposed optimal binarization has the same solution as BWN, where does the performance gain in Table 2 come from? Moreover, some of the recent quantization methods are not compared. For instance, in PACT [3], 2-bit weight&acitvation quantization already achieves 64.4% top-1 accuracy of Resnet18 on ImageNet, while the proposed method achieves the same accuracy with full-precision activation and 2-bit weight (Table 2). In addition, according to Table 2, the proposed method also can not beat LQ-Net. \n\n\n[1] Rastegari, Mohammad, et al. \"Xnor-net: Imagenet classification using binary convolutional neural networks.\" ECCV, 2016.\n[2] Hou, Lu, and James T.

We did not present a rigorous proof since it involves asymptotic analysis of largest singular values of a random matrix with non-zero mean which we believed to be not very relevant to the contributions of the paper and would unnecessarily complicate it. The sketch of this proof is as follows:  In [1] and [2] the authors show that the largest singular value of a random matrix with i.i.d. entries from a distribution with mean $\\mu$ and bounded 4th moment (which is the case for standard folded normal distribution) asymptotes to $\\sqrt{mn}\\mu$ as $m$ and $n$ are increased (with $m/n \\to$constant). Note that $\\mathbb{E}[\\frac{{\\bf 1}^T}{\\sqrt{m}} |X|~\\! |X|^T \\frac{{\\bf 1}}{\\sqrt{m}} ]  = \\mathbb{E}[\\frac{{\\bf 1}^T}{\\sqrt{n}} |X|^T ~\\! |X| \\frac{{\\bf 1}}{\\sqrt{n}} ] = mn\\mu^2$ (with convergence given by the central limit theorem), and therefore, for large matrices the first left and right singular vectors are expected to be almost constant. If the reviewer believes that this proof adds to the paper, we will be happy to include it.\n\nFrom (3), we conclude that: (a) The optimal rank-1 binary quantization captures $2/\\pi \\simeq 0.64$ of the total energy of $X$, making it a good approximation, (b) optimal rank-1 binary quantization can be written as a scalar times a binary matrix.\n\n\n[1] Silverstein, Jack W. \"The spectral radii and norms of large dimensional non-central random matrices.\" Stochastic Models 10.3 (1994): 525-532.\n[2] Bryc, Wlodek, and Jack W.

We believe that the concern of the reviewer is due to a misunderstanding (convexity of the optimization problem) which we clarify below. We would appreciate if the reviewer would reevaluate the contributions based on the provided clarifications.\n\nComment 1: (\u201cFinding the best quantization ends up in solving a program, which is convex and quite straightforward for k=1 and 2, and unfortunately (apparently) non-convex for k>2 ...\u201d)\nThe optimization problem discussed in this paper is not convex for any $k$. In (8), the optimization is over both $s_i$\u2019s (functions with range in {-1,1}) and $v_i$\u2019s (non-negative scalars). This optimization domain is a non-convex set. For this non-convex problem, we derive the optimal solution when $k$ is equal to 1, 2 and for ternary quantization. The solution to this problem requires finding a solution that satisfies equations (10) and (11). An efficient algorithm is explained in Section 3.2.2 to solve equations (10) and (11). We suppose the convexity discussion after equation (8) might have led to the misunderstanding that the problem is convex for $k=1$ and 2, therefore, in the revised draft we modified this section  to be more clear.\n\nComment 2: (\u201cThe motivation of this work is DNN, arguing that quantized vectors should improve computations cost, hence some experiments are provide on DNN ...\u201d)\nThis work is a follow-up on a sequence of papers on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). In this work, we specifically focussed on improving the quantization accuracy to improve the model performance, while maintaining a similar computational saving as previous works (for example in [1] the authors show 23x speed-up in matrix-matrix multiplication when binary quantization is used, in [2] the authors report 58x speed up when using BNNs). Therefore, we did not discuss latency and power saving when XNOR based computations are used. We clarified this in the revised draft.\n\nComment 3: (\u201cThe main criticisms is therefore the lack of concrete evidences that those schemes are actually helpful and, on the other hand, the relative simplicity ...\u201d)\nWe respectfully disagree this criticism. \nExperiments: Our goal in this paper is to improve the quantization accuracy, while keeping the same computational budget as original BNN/XNor papers. In Section 5, we present a comprehensive set of experiments: (1) quantization error of activations, (2) post-training quantization, and (3) during-training quantization. All experiments show that the proposed optimal quantization algorithms significantly improve the accuracy. \nTheory:  Introduced rank-1 binary quantization analysis is a unified framework to analyze different scaling strategies that were proposed in the literature (e.g. scaling used in XNOR-net [2]). Using this analysis, we show that the scaled binary quantization is a good approximation to a full precision tensor. Moreover, as discussed above, the optimization problem (8) is non-convex. For this non-convex problem, we derive the provably optimal solution when $k$ is equal to 1, 2 and for ternary quantization for an arbitrary data distribution.\n\n[1] Hubara, Itay, et al. \"Quantized neural networks: Training neural networks with low precision weights and activations.\" The Journal of Machine Learning Research 18.1 (2017): 6869-6898.\n[2] Mohammad Rastegari, Vicente Ordonez, Joseph Redmon, and Ali Farhadi.

We are glad that the reviewer appreciated the significance of the presented theory. The following are our responses to reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\nComment 1: (\u201cThe writing is of good quality. The length is a bit larger than the recommended length of 8 page\u201d)\nAs suggested by the reviewer we compressed the manuscript to 8 pages.\n\nComment 2: (Relation of rank-k quantization in Section 2 to the proposed method)\nAs reviewer mentioned computing the optimal low-rank binary quantization through SVD is computationally expensive. Our goal to introduce low rank binary quantization is providing a unified framework to analyze different scaling strategies used in the literature. For example, we show that the scaling used in XNOR-net is a special rank-1 binary quantization. Moreover, using this framework we show that \u201cscaled binary quantization\u201d is a good approximation to a full precision tensor with i.i.d. Normal entries (which is approximately the case in layer activations or weights of a full precision neural network). In our derivation we first approximate a full precision tensor by the optimal rank-1 binary quantization. We then show that the optimal rank-1 binary quantization captures most of the energy (~0.64) of the full precision matrix, and can be approximated as a scalar times a binary matrix.\n\nThanks for the suggestion to simplify Section 2. In the revised manuscript, we removed the rank-k quantization and only discuss the rank-1 binary quantization to make the above points clearer. This also helped us to compress the paper to 8 pages as suggested by the reviewer.\n\nComment 3: (\u201cSomewhere in the text, the authors have to explain the optimality is with respect to the L_2 loss\u201d)\n In the revised draft, we clarified the choice of L2 loss and the optimal solution depends on the loss (in the first paragraph of Section 3).\n\nComment 4: (\u201cFigure 4, could you explain why the angle trends up as the layer index increases\u201d)\nIn Figure 4 (Figure 3 in the revised manuscript), we investigate the accuracy of different quantization schemes discussed in the manuscript for activation maps of a trained (non-quantized) network. The network is a trained image classifier, therefore, as the layer index increases the feature maps become more linearly separable. This is done through the composition of several layers of non-linearities (ReLU in this case). Application of ReLU in each layer results in concentration of many inactive feature maps at zero. Hence, after batch-normalization we observe more skewed distribution in later layers, in contrast to early layers that are more similar to normal distribution. The family of binary quantization schemes discussed in this paper (that enables efficient implementation using bit-wise XNOR operations) are symmetric, hence, are less accurate for more skewed distributions. Figure 4 (Figure 3 in the revised manuscript) shows that when the introduced optimal 2-bits quantization is used, the sensitivity of error (angle) to layer index is significantly less. We clarified this in the revised draft.\n\nComment 5: (\u201cAfter equation(4): mention the choice of p(x)\u201d)\nThe optimal quantizations introduced in Section 3 (1-bit, 2-bits, and ternary) hold for any distribution. We do not make any specific choice for distribution p(x). We clarified this in the revised draft in the first paragraph of Section 3.\n\nComments 6: (Typos)\nThanks for pointing out to the typos.

The authors proposed the optimal 1-bit/2-bit/ternary quantization schemes based on minimizing the L_2 loss. The authors proposed a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal k-bit quantization.  The authors showed through extensive experiments on real DNNs that the proposed optimal quantization (Opt in the tables) can give better generalization as compared to several state-of-the-art alternative methods.\n\nThe reviewer appreciates that this quantized DNN-paper has a theory. This theory is based on minimizing the L_2 loss between the original data and quantized data. It unifies several quantization schemes into one framework. This is in contract with technical papers in the area which propose a single quantization method. The proposed quantization can further be implemented efficiently using XNOR operations and bit-counting.\n\nThe writing is of good quality. The length is a bit larger than the recommended length of 8 pages.\n\nThe reviewer has the following concerns,\n\n- This paper motivates from rank-k quantization but implemented as a scaled quantization. At the end of page 3, the authors showed that the scaled quantization can somehow approximate the rank-k quantization. However, the approximation is loose without any guarantee. Overall, I don't understand how the low-rank quantization in section 2 is related to the proposed method and fits in the overall picture. Ideally, in section 2, the authors can have some theoretical statements to state the optimality of the rank-k quantization. Then, the authors can say that, because of practical difficulties to implement the SVD, the use the scaled binary quantization instead. Or, the authors can simply remove section 2, and add a paragraph to introduce rank-k quantization, which is in contract to the scaled quantization they used in the paper.\n\nSomewhere in the text, the authors have to explain the optimality is with respect to the L_2 loss. There can be alternative quantization based on different losses.\n\nFigure 4, could you explain why the angle trends up as the layer index increases?\n\nAfter equation(4): mention the choice of p(x)\n\nIn conclusion, analyz -> analyze, introduc->introduce"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1783/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1783/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "OPTIMAL BINARY QUANTIZATION FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS", "authors": ["Hadi Pouransari", "Oncel Tuzel"], "authorids": ["mpouransari@apple.com", "onceltuzel@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Binary Neural Networks", "Quantization"], "abstract": "Quantizing weights and activations of deep neural networks results in significant improvement in inference efficiency at the cost of lower accuracy.
