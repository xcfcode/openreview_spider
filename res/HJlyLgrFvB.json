We have also cited the mentioned work in the new revision. For the experiments we use trick losses compared with optimal play assuming perfect information as the evaluation metric. \n\nHere is a summarization of our contributions. \n\nExisting methods, such as Counterfactual Regret Minimization, can handle incomplete information games with small belief space, e.g. Two-player Poker [1] (51*52/2 = 1326 possible card configuration), Hanabi [2] (only your own cards are not visible. #hidden states is around 10 millions and quickly drops when more cards are played) and Avalon the Resistance [3] (belief space is 60 for 5 players with different hidden roles). In contrast, in Contract Bridge, the hidden information space is large, since 2 out of 4 players' cards are unknown, which is about C(26, ``13) = 10 millions possibilities and unlike Hanabi, this number will not drop quickly over playing. \n\nIn this paper we want to address this issue by handling exponentially large hidden information space in Contract Bridge via a hybrid approach of sampling and neural network.  We show that a pre-trained neural network on millions of data with ground truth score obtained by complete information (from DDS solver) can predict the next best action given incomplete information fairly accurately, without intensive belief sampling. Furthermore, by reweighing the samples using past action history, we show the performance can be further improved, compared to multiple baselines. In summary, with a tight computation budget we can reach decent performance without a single call to the expensive DDS solver. We also perform a number of ablation studies.  \n\n[1] Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals, N. Brown and T. Sandholm.

While one is trained with perfect information, the other one (ISSN) with imperfect information.\nThe ISSN is then used to compute posterior probability distribution (based on a history leading to the current state). The ideas is that such posterior distribution should perform better compared to uniform distribution when used in determinization process.\n\nI like the idea / motivation of the paper, but the authors could do a better job of explaining the motivation to people less familiar with techniques based on the determinization framework.\nI also like the baselines that they chose to compare against - but the resulting comparison is far from perfect (see Issues section).\n\nMinor issues:\n -  Please do a careful language check - the grammar is wrong in many places (most notably plural/singular nouns).\nWhile this does not hurt the semantics, it makes it sometimes cumbersome to read.\n\n  - Since this work is mostly about using non-uniform distribution during the determinization process, I think it's worthwhile to also mention [Whitehouse, Daniel. Monte carlo tree search for games with hidden information and uncertainty. Diss. University of York, 2014.] as reference point.\n\nIssues:\n - My biggest issue is the experimental and evaluation section. The reported improvements seem small, but most importantly - it is impossible to asses the relevance of the results. \n  There are no confidence intervals or variance reported. Given the seemingly small improvements, this could easily be noise?\n\n - While I am not certain, I assume that your numbers in Table 2 come from the 'test' split of the data - one would guess you used that split to stop the training (select the best model)?\n  If that is the case, I don't think you can use the same split during the evaluation (even though you evaluate differently) - the reported numbers will be biased.\n\nImprovement Suggestions\n  - Please see my issues with the evaluation.\n  - You say you will release the data and code - that is great, do it!\n  - Your figures are way too large for what they do. I think you should make them much more compact and use the resulting space to improve and expand the experimental section.

The rows across \u201cReweighing DDS\u201d and \u201cReweighing SSN\u201d are not meant to be directly compared. Since the cost is small enough, we are trading accuracy for speed, and with a very tight computational budget we are still able to get decent results. We are doing more analysis on which situations the method performs better.\n\nQ2 We have tried to use Bayesian Action Decoder as a baseline method. However BAD requires to track the whole possible state space (millions in the beginning of Hanabi, but quickly reduces to hundreds ~ thousands, because cards are played and hinted). However, during the bidding phase the number of card combinations for an agent is C(52, 13), and does not decrease. This makes BAD intractable, and is one of the reasons that we choose to use simulation based Bayesian method. We have also tested BAD on a mini-version of bridge such that each player only holds 2 suits and 5 cards. We enumerate all the possible states and make BAD belief updates, but it cannot converge to the optimal solution.  To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge there is no other similar baseline work done for imperfect information games. \n\nQ3 To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge GIB, Jack and Wbridge5 all use a similar engine for the playing phase, except for the human designed heuristic part. Some of the heuristics include information gathered from the bidding phase. Also, Jack and Wbridge5 are close sourced commercial software so we are not sure what heuristics are used exactly. Thus we compared against the simplest baseline.\n\nOther:\nYes, all the cost is average trick loss from optimal play, and optimal play is always assumed perfect information\n\nWhy playing \u201cQ\u201d from AQ3 is unusual: When it goes J-K to a player, if you play A you will win the current trick, and since AK are already played, Q is very likely to win the next trick as well (if it is not trumped). Playing Q will lose this trick, although A will win sometime in the future, the agent basically throws away a trick. That\u2019s why playing Q with AQ3 is very unlikely. We will put this explanation paragraph in the next revision. \n\nWhen \u201chands\u201d are referring to all 4 hands, we are switching to call it \u201cdeal\u201d\n\nData augmentation: we stated in the main text (end of 4.4.1) that we augment the data by shuffling suit.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2308/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2308/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["qucheng@fb.com", "yuandong@fb.com"], "title": "All Simulations Are Not Equal: Simulation Reweighing for Imperfect Information Games", "authors": ["Qucheng Gong", "Yuandong Tian"], "TL;DR": "Reweighing simulations through action history backwards verification can improve performances in imperfect information games.", "abstract": "Imperfect information games are challenging benchmarks for artificial intelligent systems.

Maybe it is just the interpretation/contextualization that is insufficient.  I have 3 important remarks:\n\n1. It is stated in the abstract \"that it [the new method] outperforms previous state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulation based methods, and achieves better play per decision.\"  However, the costs in the 'reweighing DDS' section (table 2) are lower (better) than those of the 'reweighing SSN' section.  The results show improvement upon using some reweighing, as ISSN+sthg is better than without ISSN (although by a very small relative decrease in cost).\n1.a. I understand that the NN-based methods (last three lines of table 2) are incomparably faster than the DDS-based approaches (baseline). And the total rate of tricks loss per initial state remains low (6% seems small as an absolute value).  But, they are almost double of the DDS-based loss rates !  It is not clear how this can be considered 'outperforming' or 'better play per decision'.  If you can explain in which sense those are good results for the SSN vs DDS, please do so. If they are not, please do acknowledge it, and eventually contextualize (maybe a 2-fold increase of loss rate is okay given the large speedup obtained?).\n1.b. in the same way, it is not clear how ISSN outperforms its no-memory counterparts, given the loss decreases are essentially negligible. Maybe one needs to increase the value of T to make ISSN's success more obvious?\n2. In addition, why not compare this Bayesian method with other Bayesian methods (quoted at the very end of section 3)?  Here the paper focuses on comparison with 'deterministic'  methods, i.e. methods which sample complete states (simulations) to then solve the complete-information version of the game (via exhaustive tree search).  Those are what I would call brute-force methods.\nHowever, although simulations may be done (expensively) for contract bridge, in some other cases this kind of sampling may become prohibitively expensive, so that only Bayesian methods are left.  If this kind of argument is the justification for your work, please make it more explicitly.  Otherwise please correct me and explain the context (the role of Bayesian methods, what has been done and what hasn't been) more clearly.\nIf you are to situate the work within the Bayesian-based approaches, the question remains: is ISSN+SSN better than other Bayesian-inspired, \"information-completing\" methods ?  \nTo summarize, the paper convincingly shows that Bayesian-NN methods can compete with expensive brute force methods, but it would be very nice to see how the method introduced compares with other recent Bayesian approaches. (Or if no such comparison can be done, explain why).\n\n3. In addition, here it seems your baseline is based on GIB, which was winning tournaments ~20 years ago: why not compare with Wbridge5 or JackBridge ?  I think you need to at least explain your choice.\n\nBecause of these weak points in terms of experimental results, I lean to reject the paper.  However, depending on the authors answers and clarifications on my 3 important remarks above, I am ready to change my rating.\n\n\n\nAlso, I have a couple of more or less minor remarks to improve the paper:\nThe definition of the cost is not explicitly given: \"We set up the evaluation metric by tricks loss per deal. The ground truth play is DDS result for the original deal and all simulation deals. We compare all the following algorithmS with the ground truth to get costs of the policy.\"\nYou should rephrase this to make the definition of 'cost' very explicit. Is it simply the average rate of lost tricks (per given set of 13 cards in the agent hands) ?\nThis is quite crucial and make the reading of results a bit complicated (especially since results fo not match the conclusion announced in the abstract).\n\n\"DDS) 3 computes the maximum tricks  each side can get if all the plays are optimal\"\nIn this place and a couple others, you should explicitly recall whether you mean 'assuming perfect information', or not.  Sometimes it can get confusing, and a bit of repetition won't hurt.  I think I understood correctly that DDS solves (perfectly) the perfect information game, but at times I thought other methods also made use of the full information (?)\nFigure 4c is nicely explained and this part really illustrates well the idea of the method, I like it. Although, the notation AQ3 was not obvious for me at first, and I think it is worth improving this figure, making use of the right-hand-side space, to make it an autonomously explanatory figure.\n'position': the term is not defined. I would guess it means the current state of the game (the agent's hand and the cards played in the past or during the current trick). This should be said explicitly.\nAlso \"hands\" seem to refer to the 4 hands (1 for each player) (is that correct?)\n\nThere are wrong singular/plurals ('s'/no 's') in several places. This is simple to correct and should be corrected.\n\nin section 7, ablation studies. This is a very nice study, but you should precise how much you augment the data here (or recall by how much, if you say it earlier).\n\nThis passage is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity:\n\"We run DDS on all 2.4 million positions, to get the\ncorresponding results for each available action. This serves as ground truth of the current position.\nFor each position, we run 50 simulations to compute the baselines and serve as training target of the\npretrained network. Each call to DDS takes about 5 milliseconds.\"\n\nThis passage is unclear and should be rephrased for clarity:\n\"For simplicity, in this work we just use discarding information.\"\n\nThis passage is slightly unclear and should be rephrased for clarity:\n\"For each simulation, the moves with the optimal number of\ntricks are marked with optimal moves. We sum up the optimal moves counter in these k simulations.\nThis results in a counter for each legal move and we treat this as the training target. The process is\ndescribed in Figure 1.\"\"\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2308/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2308/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["qucheng@fb.com", "yuandong@fb.com"], "title": "All Simulations Are Not Equal: Simulation Reweighing for Imperfect Information Games", "authors": ["Qucheng Gong", "Yuandong Tian"], "TL;DR": "Reweighing simulations through action history backwards verification can improve performances in imperfect information games.", "abstract": "Imperfect information games are challenging benchmarks for artificial intelligent systems.

However, I had a very hard time following along with the paper. The major issue is the language, which I mean both in terms of particular phrases or terms going unexplained, and the grammar and phrasing of the sentences. \n\nThe most clear early example of terms and phrases going unexplained is the second section describing contract bridge. Many terms are used without any explanation. For example, what a target contract is or what a trump means in the case of contract bridge. This made the remainder of the paper, including the results difficult to understand. \n\nAs an indication of the grammar and phrasing issues in the paper I have below included issues from just the first page of the paper: \n- \u201cIn real world\u201d-> \u201cIn the real world\u201d\n- \u201chave to made decision\u201d -> \u201chave to make decisions\u201d\n- \u201cresearchers steers towards\u201d -> \u201cresearchers have focused on\u201d\n- \u201cChess, best action\u201d -> \u201cChess, the best action\u201d\n- \u201cit is independent of opponent and action history\u201d -> \u201cit is independent of the opponent or action history\u201d\n- \u201chistory actions\u201d -> \u201caction histories\u201d\n- \u201cIn early ages there are heuristic based system to assign different prior\u201d -> \u201cEarly approaches employ heuristic based systems to assign different priors\u201d\n- \u201ctry to convert the problem to a perfect\u201d -> \u201ctry to convert the problem into a perfect\u201d\n- \u201cexplicitly with neural networks, and try to optimize it\u201d -> \u201cexplicitly with neural networks, trying\u201d\n- (not a phrasing issue but I would have appreciated a citation for the claim at the end of the third paragraph of the intro)\n- \u201cSimulation based approach usually requires large\u201d -> \u201cSimulation based approaches usually require a large\u201d\n- \u201csequences of existing player and opponent\u201d -> \u201csequences of the existing player and opponent\u201d\n- \u201ca few underlying complete information state\u201d -> \u201ca few underlying complete information states\u201d \n\nThis issue of readability came up in the figures as well. The figures in the paper are dense and very difficult to parse. There is little explanation in the text, and I found them difficult to glean anything from without an understanding of contact bridge.\n\nFrom what I can gather from the paper this is good and valuable work. However, I think the paper is not yet ready for publication as a communication of this work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2308/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2308/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["qucheng@fb.com", "yuandong@fb.com"], "title": "All Simulations Are Not Equal: Simulation Reweighing for Imperfect Information Games", "authors": ["Qucheng Gong", "Yuandong Tian"], "TL;DR": "Reweighing simulations through action history backwards verification can improve performances in imperfect information games.", "abstract": "Imperfect information games are challenging benchmarks for artificial intelligent systems.
