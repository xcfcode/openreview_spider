The authors use a GAN based approach where it is trained in a standard way. After training is completed, the generator's latent space is explored to find a representation for a test image. Both the noise variable and generator model is updated using back propagation to achieve this. The paper is original, well written, easy to follow and presented ideas are interesting. \n\nStrengths:\n- anomaly detection for images is a difficult problem and the paper uses current state of the art in generative modeling (GAN) to perform anomaly detection.\n- experiments section includes non-parametric methods such as OC-SVM as well as deep learning methods including a recent GAN based approach and the results are promising. \n\nWeaknesses:\n - It is not clear why updating the generator during the anomaly detection helps. On evaluating on a large set of anomalies, the generator may run a risk of losing its ability to generate the original data if it is adjusted too much to the anomalies. The latent space of the generator no longer is the same that was achieved by training on the original data. I don't see how this is not a problem in the presented approach.\n- The experimental results on data with ground truth needs statistical significance tests to convince that the benefits are indeed significant. \n- It is not clear how the value of \"k\" (number of updates to the noise variable) was chosen and how sensitive it is to the performance. By having a large value of k, the reconstruction loss for an anomalous image may reduce to fall into the nominal category.

Larger k always yields better performance, we chose k=5 for a good performance/evaluation time trade-off.

We feel that it is accepted by the ML community that deep methods work the best for many high-dimensional tasks and we simply wanted to highlight that point.\n- We did not specifically address the type-II rationale in our original draft. We now highlight why we do not expect the generator to come up with an adequate representation of anomalous classes (page 3, final paragraph), thus giving some rationale for why the anomaly detector should avoid type-II errors.\n- ADGAN improves the CIFAR-10 AUC by about .014 over OC-SVM which is about an 13% improvement over the .5 random guessing baseline. (.624-.5)/(.610-.5)=1.127.
