This approach learns a graph as a convex combination of the unsupervised k-Nearest Neighbor graph and a supervised label-affinity graph. The latter graph directly captures all the nodes' label-affinity with the labeled nodes, i.e., how likely a node has the same label as the labeled nodes. Our experiments show that GLAM gives close to or better performance (up to $\\sim$1.5\\%), while being simpler and faster (up to 70x) to train, than state-of-the-art graph learning methods. We also demonstrate the importance of individual components and contrast them with the state-of-the-art methods.", "pdf": "/pdf/18c0bd3628061c42760710338cbdc55924ed8fd5.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|glam_graph_learning_by_modeling_affinity_to_labeled_nodes_for_graph_neural_networks", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021glam,\ntitle={{\\{}GLAM{\\}}: Graph Learning by Modeling Affinity to Labeled Nodes for Graph Neural Networks},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=zyRPy5KrN6},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
