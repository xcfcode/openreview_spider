We are glad you enjoyed reading the paper! Although our problem generator was based off of physics problems extracted from textbooks, word problems from AMT workers would likely introduce more complexity into our problems. This may also help us better identify the difficulty of the task, particularly if these problems were incorporated into our test sets. Thank you for the suggestion! \n\nAs of now we use two neural networks to be able to perform multiple levels of reasoning as required by the word problem, but the reviewer is correct in that some problems may require more levels of reasoning than seen in these problems. While this is true, a question answering system that can solve problems with only several levels of reasoning would still be highly useful for solving simple problems for K-12 students. Finally, while it would be an interesting problem to replace the numerical integrator, we chose to solve the first part of the challenge (to understand the word problem), as there are not established existing tools to do this, but there are many existing numerical integration tools for computers.

Given a natural language query sampled from a fixed grammar, the system uses two LSTM models to extract key components, e.g., physical parameters and the type of questions being asked, which are then sent to a numerical integrator for the answer. The overall performance in the test set is almost perfect (99.8%).\n\nOverall I found this paper quite interesting to read (and it is well written). However, it is not clear how hard the problem is and how much this approach could generalize over more realistic (and complicated) situations. The dataset are a bit small and might not cover the query space. It might be better to ask AMT workers to come up with more complicated queries/answers. The physics itself is also quite easy. What happens if we apply the same idea on billiards? In this case, even we have a perfect physics simulator, the question to be asked could be very deep and requires multi-hop reasoning.\n\nFinally, given the same problem setting (physics solver), in my opinion, a more interesting direction is to study how DNN can take the place of numerical integrator and gives rough answers to the question (i.e., intuitive physics). It is a bit disappointing to see that DNN is only used to extract the parameters while still a traditional approach is used for core reasoning part.

", "comment": "Thanks for the comments! \n\n(1) To generate the problems, we build the grammar with Python methods. Each of the nonterminals of the grammar maps to a method where the options for the nonterminals are stored in arrays. The generator begins by building up the formulation and question parts of the problem. First the object is randomly chosen by generating a random number to index into the list of possible objects. Then for the formulation, the action is randomly chosen from an array of possible actions and the assumption is randomly chosen from an array of possible assumptions. We continue this process until we have selected each of the terminals, and the full problem is composed and returned. We will update our paper to show the generation of an example problem. To check for bias, we are currently performing the analysis of the distributions of the types of problems and will update the paper shortly. \n\n(2) We agree that it would be very interesting to replace the numerical integrator by a DNN. We chose to focus on mapping the word problems to a computer solvable format because there are already defined numerical integration tools, but there are not many existing tools for computers to map word problems to a computer-interpretable form. Automating the entire flow and replacing the numerical integrator with DNNs would be interesting to explore in order to test the learning capability of DNNs and remove any manual procedure, and we will add this to our future work section.
