(2) We conducted recall-speed experiment on widely used public ann-benchmarks which contains 12 baselines including highly competitive faiss and hsnw, and have shown significant improvement over them (pls see Figure3(c)).

Our response are listed below:\n1) Sensitivity of T and b.\nb is the upper bound of the datapoint norms, therefore it is not a tuneable hyperparameter but a deterministic value given the dataset. For Glove, b=1.\nFor T, it is an estimate of \u201cthe expected distance of Top-L result\u201d, where L is some value larger than K. \n\nEmpirically the final result isn\u2019t sensitive to T for a wide range of L. For example in Glove dataset, if we set L to anywhere from 100 to10000, we arrive at roughly similar value of T (around 0.2) and they all yield sizeable improvement on retrieval recall. Thus, the results are not sensitive to precise tuning of T.\n\nL=100: T=0.323, Recall1@10=0.901; L=1000: T=0.24; Recall1@10=0.902; \nL=200: T=0.301, Recall1@10=0.907; L=2000: T=0.219, Recall1@10=0.902; \nL=500: T=0.271, Recall1@10=0.905; L=5000: T= 0.179, Recall1@10=0.901;\n\n2) Formulation did not account for error on <q, \\tilde{x}>.\nThe reviewer is worried that we are not penalizing <q, \\tilde{x}> when <q, x> is less than T. In our formulation, we quantize x to \\tilde{x} so that the pairs of (q, x) whose inner product value is larger is penalized more. In addition, one can use a smooth weighting function instead of the step function, such as w(t) = exp(-h * t). However, we did not find that to be a problem in our experiments.\n\n\n3) Tightness of bound. \nFor most neural network generated datasets, the norm of the vectors typically do not vary too much. If one is worried that it may happen, multiscale trick [Wu et al, NIPS 2017] can be used, but this is orthogonal to the contribution of this paper and highly dataset dependent.\n\n4) Minor comments:\n1) We will refer to Figure 1 in the main text in the final version.\n2) Yes, the fact T=0.0 and T=0.1 has almost the same value is coincidental. The rough value of T Recall1@10 are:\nT=0.0: 0.831, T=0.1: 0.831, T=0.2: 0.906, T=0.3: 0.902, T=0.4: 0.889 \u2026\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper945/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper945/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["guorq@google.com", "qgeng@google.com", "dsimcha@google.com", "fchern@google.com", "sunphil@google.com", "sanjivk@google.com"], "title": "New Loss Functions for Fast Maximum Inner Product Search", "authors": ["Ruiqi Guo", "Quan Geng", "David Simcha", "Felix Chern", "Phil Sun", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "pdf": "/pdf/1a6e7ff2b3b00348070a28893c6c3018051d187f.pdf", "abstract": "Quantization based methods are popular for solving large scale maximum inner product search problems.

In particular, the authors weight the reconstruction error so that the pairs with a higher scalar product are more precisely quantized (as they lie among the most plausible candidates).\n\nStrengths of the paper:\n- The paper is well written and easy to follow. In particular, the intuition of the method is well explained in Figure 1 and the setup in Section 3 is well formulated.\n- The proposed method works with a variety of quantization approaches, such as binary, simple PQ or LSQ (even if the authors aren't able to report results for this last method due to technical issues as explained in Appendix 7.7)\n\nWeaknesses of the paper:\n- The related work could be more detailed, see for example: \"Spreading vectors for Similarity Search\", Sablayrolles et al. ; \"Pairwise Quantization\",  Babenko et al ; \"Unsupervised Neural Quantization for Compressed-Domain Similarity Search\", Morozov et al.\n\nJustification of rating:\nThe paper proposes a new loss function that weights the scalar products differently according to their importance than can be applied to a wide range of existing quantization methods. However, the strength of experimental results (in particular the fact that LSQ or other cited references above are missing) remains unclear.

Instead, why not use the true task objective which for the MIPS task is stated in the Introduction section?  If this was considered please comment on reasons for not including / discussing this in the paper, otherwise perhaps this\u2019ll be good to discuss.\nb) Did the authors consider using a task dependent training data set which will capture both \u2018q\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 distributions and potentially lead to even further improved quantization?  This has the disadvantage of making quantization dependent on query distribution, but in cases where such data is available it will be very valuable to know if incorporating data distributions in quantization process helps performance and to what extent.\nc) It will also be valuable to consider the closely related task of cosine distance based retrieval and comment on how that impacts the modifications of loss functions.\nd) The idea of learning quantization under objective of interest using observed data distribution has been studied earlier (e.g. see Marcheret et al., \u201cOptimal quantization and bit allocation for compressing large discriminative feature space transforms,\u201d ASRU 2009), perhaps worth citing as related work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper945/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper945/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["guorq@google.com", "qgeng@google.com", "dsimcha@google.com", "fchern@google.com", "sunphil@google.com", "sanjivk@google.com"], "title": "New Loss Functions for Fast Maximum Inner Product Search", "authors": ["Ruiqi Guo", "Quan Geng", "David Simcha", "Felix Chern", "Phil Sun", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "pdf": "/pdf/1a6e7ff2b3b00348070a28893c6c3018051d187f.pdf", "abstract": "Quantization based methods are popular for solving large scale maximum inner product search problems.
