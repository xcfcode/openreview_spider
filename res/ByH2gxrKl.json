The following text is extracted from the full version of this paper, available on arxiv:\n\n\"Why not to use a ConvNet to learn an end-to-end mapping that predicts the velocity field at each time-step? The chaotic change of velocity between frames is highly unstable and easily affected by external forces and other factors. We argue that our proposed hybrid approach restricts the learning task to a stable projection step relieving the need of modeling the well understood advection and external body forces. The proposed method takes advantage of the understanding and modeling power of classic approaches, supporting enhancing tools such as vorticity confinement. Having said this, end-to-end models are conceptually simpler and, combined with adversarial training [Goodfellow et al. 2014], have shown promising results for difficult tasks such as video prediction [Mathieu et al. 2015].

It's certainly encouraging that other members of the community find our evaluation results compelling. To answer your specific questions:\n\nQUESTION: \"Is there a metric that measures this approximation effect?\" and \"I think it will be very helpful to develop some quantitative evaluation metrics based on fluid dynamics theories.\"\n\nThe goal of this work (as for many approximate methods) is to obtain a simulation that, while not being exact according to the physical model, maximally satisfies constraints while maintain long-term stability and accuracy. In the literature, standard qualitative evaluation for approximate methods usually entails measuring a single time-step divergence residual (using either p-norm or max) and comparing wall-clock simulation time. However, we show that satisfying single-frame divergence residual is not enough to ensure that long-term PDE trajectories result in \"natural\" behavior. For instance, the Jacobi method has similar divergence residual to our network when looking at time-steps independently (for some of our evaluation conditions), but over multiple frames it is \"visually divergent\" to the highly accurate PCG result.\n\nAnalytically formulating a quantitative evaluation metric for this \"natural behavior\" is a difficult problem, and itself subject of ongoing research. Multi-frame dynamics is not straight forward given that the Navier Stokes system is inherently a chaotic PDE, and so comparing methods via long-term trajectories is not fair or accurate (since very small perturbations early on can result in significantly divergent end frame values that are equally plausible). The long term dynamics is also additionally dependent on the mechanics of the advection stage (since now the behavior is defined by the system as a whole), which makes independent evaluation of the linear system solver difficult. As such, for this work we present the standard measures of accuracy (single frame divergence) and show qualitative (read: visual) comparisons for long-term behavior when we can, and leave quantitative evaluation of multi-frame dynamics to future work.\n\nI do want to point out that our qualitative evaluation does highlight one noticeable artifact (or deficiency) of our method: the loss of density near geometry and is visible as less dense smoke in the Arch simulation. However, we attribute this to the fact that the boundary conditions of this simulation are significantly different to those in the training conditions (i.e. it is a test of generalization).\n\nQUESTION: \"I think the use of objective function that \u201cemphasizes the divergence of voxels on geometry boundaries\u201d deserves more explanation and investigation.\"\n\nUnfortunately, we could not cover this in detail due to space limitations of the workshop format. However, we appreciate that the lack of detail here might lead to confusion and so we will add more detail to the next paper revision.\n\nThe use of this weighting function is in essence similar to class waiting to counter-act skewed label distributions when training classifiers. That is, the fluid-geometry boundary voxels represent a small fraction of the simulation domain, and so the divergence error of these voxels will be de-emphasized by (or a small fraction of) our total MSE loss. We therefore increase the linear weighting of these voxels to account for their low frequency in our training data. Additionally, large errors on slip-condition boundaries result in noticeable visual artifacts, while non-zero divergence residual for free-space voxels tend to result in either additional turbulence or numerical dissipation; both of which look like natural phenomena.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Accelerating Eulerian Fluid Simulation With Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Efficient simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow is a long standing problem in applied mathematics, for which state-of-the-art methods require large compute resources.
