"content": {"title": "Final Decision", "decision": "Reject", "comment": "the authors demonstrated that vanilla RNN, GRU and LSTM compute at each timestep a hidden state which is the sum of the current input and the weighted sum of the previous hidden states (weights can be either unit or complicated functions), when sigmoid and tanh functions are replaced by their second-order taylor series each. they refer to the first term as token-level and the second term as sequence-level, and claim that the latter can be thought of as summing n-gram features in the case of GRU & LSTM due to the complicated weight matrices used for the weighted sum, largely arising from the gating mechanisms. \n\nthe reviewers are largely unsure about the significance of the findings in this paper due to a couple of reasons with which i agree. first, it is unclear whether the proposed approximation scheme is enough to capture much of what happens within either GRU or LSTM. if we consider a single step, it's likely fine to ignore the O(x^3) term arising from either sigmoid or tanh, but when unrolled over time, it's unclear whether these error terms will accumulate or cancel each other. without either empirically or theoretically verifying the sanity of this approximation, it's difficult to judge whether the authors' findings are specific to this approximation scheme or do indeed reflect what happens within GRU/LSTM. \n\nsecond, because the authors have used relative simple benchmarks to demonstrate their points, it is difficult, if not impossible, to tell whether the authors' findings are about the datasets themselves (which are all well known to be easily solvable or solvable very well with n-gram classification models and n-gram language models) or about GRU/LSTM, which is related to the first weakness shared by the reviewer. the observations that n-gram models and simplified GRU/LSTM models work as well as the original GRU/LSTM models on these datasets might simply imply that these datasets don't require any complicated interaction among the tokens beyond counting n-grams, which lead to the original GRU/LSTM trained to be simplified (n-gram detectors.) \n\nthat said, i still believe this direction is important and is filled with many interesting observations to be made. i suggest the authors (1) verify the efficacy of their approximation scheme (probably empirical validation is enough, and (2) demonstrate their point with more sophisticated problems (carefully designed synthetic datasets are perfectly fine.)\n\n\n"}, "signatures":

Putting these linearized, or, really, affine, RNN cells together into a single-layer sequence processor, thanks to the affine-ness, we can decompose the score that is obtained by taking dot products with a query at each timestep into contribution by immediate unigram features and all subsequences leading to this unigram. The authors evaluate these scores, showing that they do and don't capture phenomena in a synthetic dataset and proceeding to show that when both training and evaluating with this simplified network on SST yields strong results.\n\n#### Strengths/what I loved:\n\n- Motivation and Related Work seemed nicely done, set this paper up nicely, and made me excited to read on!\n- I like the idea of testing double negation and omitting it during training and it was interesting to see the networks then fail to pick up on it (assuming the synthetic dataset is reasonable).\n- The visualizations of sequence-level scores (Figures 2 and 4) are very cleverly chosen and powerful, even if they take a bit of getting used to.\n- Figures 3 and 5 are striking: even on SST unigrams and perhaps bigrams seem to get you most of the way if you trust the approximate interpretation.\n\n#### Criticism/weaknesses:\n\n- It is unclear how the simplified/affine-ized architecture relates to vanilla RNNs---those, too, can be decomposed like that and one could just as well look at these features. To paraphrase: I don't see why any of the analysis and results in this paper is only true for gated cells and I wouldn't be surprised to see a vanilla RNN yield equally good approximate cells, since after all the task is very simplistic (Section 5.2 concludes as much, as even without sequence information the task is easy to solve, but the conclusion drawn from that result, namely that there is something about GRUs and LSTMs to read from this doesn't follow in my opinion).\n- The synthetic dataset is a mystery: yes, it contains sentences that contain the words shown in Table 6 (Appendix A.2), but... what are these sentences? Are they actual text from some dataset? Text sampled from some model or grammar? Random words without any sequential coherence? What is the vocabulary size? What does appearing \"mostly\" in positive or negative instances really mean? Just giving one or two examples would have made me a lot less worried and confused about what is going on here, but to base many if not most of the results on it, this dataset is woefully underdescribed.\n\n#### Questions:\n\n- Notation/definitions in section 5.1.1 are either very unclear or flat-out wrong: Sun & Lu (2020) do indeed define a notion of a \"token-level polarity score\" for each output class, but the notion of output classes is not mentioned at all here, in fact instead of the output embedding matrix W that Sun & Lu (2020) posit, this paper speaks only of a single vector w. I assume that that is the vector associated with the positive class and the prediction thus is strictly binary---very much unlike Sun & Lu (2020). In addition to that, the notion of a \"sequence-level polarity score\" that here complements the token-level score is not at all mentioned in Sun & Lu (2020) as far as I can see, so to say that their methodology is used is misleading in more than one way. Finally, the model described in Sun & Lu (2020) is one that uses attention, i.e., that does mean-pooling after the linear layer that is transforming the individual states. This paper mentions the linear layer, but not the pooling/attention, so it's unclear if that is a poor paraphrase of Sun & Lu or whether this paper here too diverges from the paper it claims to build on.\n- Are Figures 2 and 4 cherry-picked? Since nothing else is stated, I would assume so. In light of that, the longest subsequence on the right of Figure 2 being negative is rather strange. Do you have an explanation? Is \"those\" a negative word?\n- I think it would've been very interesting to see whether or not this simplification is legitimate, that is whether the assumptions made in the derivation are justified: train with the original cell formulation, but then evaluate *quantitatively* using the approximate cell to essentially create a table like Table 2 or perhaps even a scatter plot for individual logits to see how much things change or don't change. That would go a long way to convince me that the approximation is at least reasonable.\n- A.3: \"there's an apparent difference\" What is that difference? I don't see any.\n- A.4: What is the change here, can you highlight it or motivate it? The results certainly aren't particularly impressive, so I'm tempted to say this section hurts more than it helps...\n\n#### Typos and other small things:\n\n- 5.1: As you have multiple runs, which one was selected? The best according to some metric? The median or mean somehow? Or randomly chosen? Either way, I strongly feel that empirical results should always come with a sense of stability: what was the variance between runs? Between hyperparameters? How sensitive are results and what can we say about statistical significance?\n- The overlaid histograms definitely need to have some transparency or be shown another way---right now it is impossible to see what is \"happening\" in the blue bars as they are hidden by the orange bars.\n- The last sentence of Section 5 should link to A.4, I guess?\n\n\n---\n\nI read and appreciated the response, but my overall rating is still leaning negative.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2874/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2874/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE-LEVEL FEATURES: HOW GRU AND LSTM CELLS CAPTURE N-GRAMS", "authorids": ["~Xiaobing_Sun1", "luwei@sutd.edu.sg"], "authors": ["Xiaobing Sun", "Wei Lu"], "keywords": ["GRU", "LSTM", "Sequence-level", "Features", "N-grams"], "abstract": "Modern recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) have demonstrated impressive results on tasks involving sequential data in practice.

With strong arguments I could be persuaded to change my score.\n\nThis paper introduces a method to unroll the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit using a taylor expansion. Essentially a linearization of the GRU and LSTM. Given the simplifications, the authors argue that their model captures N-gram information for the sequential information. The paper presents results suggesting that this approximation is able to capture much of the same sequential information as the LSTM and GRU on benchmarks such as SST-2, PDB, Wikitext-2, and Wikitext-103.\n\nWhat this paper excels at is a thorough theoretical formulation of the proposed approximation, and a comparison with an approximation without the sequential information. This shows that the approximate version is able to capture sequential information.\n\nHowever, the relevance of this paper is not clear to me, and the introduction and related works does little more to explain that relevance than stating: \u201cunderstanding the essential features captured by GRU/LSTM\u201d.

The unrolled architecture of either a GRU cell or an LSTM cell is different from vanilla RNN cells. In the paper, we extracted the first two parts from the unrolled architecture of a standard GRU cell or a standard LSTM cell and represented them as: $hat h_t = f(x_t) + \\sum_{i=1}^t A(x_t)...A(x_{i+1}) f(x_i)$,  which consists of two parts: token-level feature and sequence-level features. \nWe can also linearize a vanilla RNN as: $hat h_t = f(x_t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} W^{t-i} f(x_i)$. Each term $W^{t-i} f(x_i)$ in the right part cannot be viewed as a sequence-level feature as it does not contain the input information other than x_i.  The matrix-vector product $A(x_t)...A(x_{i+1}) f(x_i)$ can be more expressive than  $W^{t-i} f(x_i)$. Thanks for highlighting this question and we have revised the paper accordingly to discuss this finding.\n\nThe synthetic dataset. The synthetic sentences were created based on simple grammatical rules. Our purpose was to create a balanced training set that provides sufficient labels for polarity tokens and their negated expressions. Then we can examine whether models can capture negation and double negation with respect to the sequence-level features for both positive and negative words. We have provided more details in the appendix of the revised version.\n\nQuestions:\n1.We adopted the idea of polarity score from the work of Sun & Lu (2020)  to measure the association between a token (or a sequence) and a specific label.  For 3-class (or more classes) sentiment analysis, the fully-connected layer weight is a matrix, and the output overall polarity score is a vector corresponding to label space. Actually, we can also do so for binary classification and the output polarity score will be 2-dimension. But very often for binary classification, the fully-connected layer weight is a vector, and the output overall polarity score is a scalar which will be used for making classification decisions, e.g., positive instance if it is greater than 0, negative instance otherwise.  We can also define such polarity scores for our sentiment analysis model based on RNNs. Based on our analysis, if we use the final hidden state for classification, the overall polarity score of a phrase will be viewed as the sum of the token-level polarity score  (last token), all the sequence-level polarity scores and the scores produced by other terms.   If they are significant, they will be expected to behave in the desired way on downstream tasks.       \n  \n2.We ran multiple trials for each model, and we found the patterns were similar. The figures were reported based on results from random initializations. We have reported more results from multiple trials in our revised version. The sequence-level features will develop apparent patterns under sufficient exposures to certain labeling information. For example, if we only have labeled phrases \u201cnot not not good\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d in the training set but without the label information about \u201cnot not good\u201d, the model may fail to learn the semantics of \u201cnot\u201d and hence may not be able to correctly label the phrase \u201cnot not good\u201d the model will not necessarily learn a clear pattern for  \u201cnot not good\u201d. We have added such experiments in the revised version.  Similarly, there are no specific patterns for the polarity scores of the entire sequence \u201cthose filmmakings were not not charming\u201d, and we observed it was close to 0 in another trial. But the patterns for the trigram \u201cnot not charming\u201d and \u201cnot charming\u201d are clear.\n\n 3.We did not seek to approximate the hidden states precisely. The gaps might be large if the input magnitudes were large. We believe that the sequence-level and token-level features are significant among all the possible features captured by GRU or LSTM cells.  We examined so on sentiment analysis tasks as well as language modeling tasks.\n\n4.We have revised the sentence. \n\n5.Certain coefficients and constants were changed compared to the original approximate hidden states. We have removed the part for proposed architectures and focused on examining sequence-level features.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2874/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2874/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE-LEVEL FEATURES: HOW GRU AND LSTM CELLS CAPTURE N-GRAMS", "authorids": ["~Xiaobing_Sun1", "luwei@sutd.edu.sg"], "authors": ["Xiaobing Sun", "Wei Lu"], "keywords": ["GRU", "LSTM", "Sequence-level", "Features", "N-grams"], "abstract": "Modern recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) have demonstrated impressive results on tasks involving sequential data in practice.

As we have mentioned in the original version, we could not rule out the influence of those high-order terms, but we chose to focus on the sequence-level features and assess their significance. \nThe gap between the hidden states of a standard cell (either GRU or LSTM) and the approximated one could be obvious in real scenarios.

The proposed method approximates the hidden states of LSTMs and GRUs with a first-order Taylor series, which the authors claim is an adequate approximation with small enough inputs.

I didn't quite understand what this is supposed to represent, is it how predictive of a label a particular span is? \n- why are synthetic datasets used at all here? experiments on a small set of sentences with a tiny vocabulary and artificial \"double negatives\" are not compelling.

The authors expand the sigmoid function and the hyperbolic tangent function using Taylor series to obtain approximated closed-form mathematical expression of hidden representation when using the GRU or the LSTM as the update rules. The approximated hidden representation of the GRU and the LSTM update rules can be separated into two terms, (1) the current token-level input feature and (2) the sequence-level feature, which is a weighted sum of all previous tokens. As the hidden representation consists of two feature terms, one can take each feature (either token-level or sequence-level) separately for a downstream task, e.g., evaluate how good when sequence-level feature is used for predicting polarity score in sentiment analysis.\n \nThe idea of improving theoretical understanding on how n-grams are modelled by gated recurrent activation functions is sound. However, I am not entirely satisfied with what has been investigated after obtaining the approximated closed-form expression of gated recurrent activation functions. The tasks that were used in the experiments are sentiment analysis and language modelling. In sentiment analysis, most of the plots were there to show how token-level features or sequence-level features align with the polarity score, and we can observe some sort of individual implication from each term. However, it is predictable that sequence-level feature should be meaningful. I don't see much of insights by showing that the polarity score from sequence-level features indeed align with this prediction. If we can to apply Taylor expansion to simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such that we can expand the hidden representation of a standard RNN into two terms: the current token-level input feature and sequence-level feature, how would the results look like and how can we relate them with what were reported in this paper? Is this paper particularly showing how gated RNNs are modelling n-grams or RNNs in general? A comparison would be nice to show how sequence features get improved in gated RNNs.\n\nIt is interesting to see that the approximated versions of GRUs and LSTMs can perform on a par with the original models on language modelling tasks, however, these results don't necessarily improve our understanding on how gated RNNs are capable of learning good representations of n-grams. They confirm that sequence features are indeed helpful though.\n\nIn Section 5.1, if there were multiple trials of experiments on the same task, why not report the average and the variance of the results instead of one set out of multiple results?\n\nIn Section 5.2, Adpative softmax (Joulin et al., 2017) was used for Wikitext-130. -> Adpative softmax (Joulin et al., 2017) was used for\nWikitext-103.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2874/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2874/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SEQUENCE-LEVEL FEATURES: HOW GRU AND LSTM CELLS CAPTURE N-GRAMS", "authorids": ["~Xiaobing_Sun1", "luwei@sutd.edu.sg"], "authors": ["Xiaobing Sun", "Wei Lu"], "keywords": ["GRU", "LSTM", "Sequence-level", "Features", "N-grams"], "abstract": "Modern recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) have demonstrated impressive results on tasks involving sequential data in practice. Despite continuous efforts on interpreting their behaviors, the exact mechanism underlying their successes in capturing sequence-level information have not been thoroughly understood. In this work, we present a study on understanding the essential features captured by GRU/LSTM cells by mathematically expanding and unrolling the hidden states. Based on the expanded and unrolled hidden states, we find there was a type of sequence-level representations brought in by the gating mechanism, which enables the cells to encode sequence-level features along with token-level features. Specifically, we show that the cells would consist of such sequence-level features similar to those of N-grams. Based on such a finding, we also found that replacing the hidden states of the standard cells with N-gram representations does not necessarily degrade performance on the sentiment analysis and language modeling tasks, indicating such features may play a significant role for GRU/LSTM cells.", "one-sentence_summary": "We found that the impressive performances of GRU or LSTM cells might be attributed to sequence-level representations brought in by the gating mechanism.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "sun|sequencelevel_features_how_gru_and_lstm_cells_capture_ngrams", "pdf": "/pdf/952db6c5f6f9c2dc9ce7595510f7b68997645925.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=20_ioE_zs_", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsun2021sequencelevel,\ntitle={{\\{}SEQUENCE{\\}}-{\\{}LEVEL{\\}} {\\{}FEATURES{\\}}: {\\{}HOW{\\}} {\\{}GRU{\\}} {\\{}AND{\\}} {\\{}LSTM{\\}} {\\{}CELLS{\\}} {\\{}CAPTURE{\\}} N-{\\{}GRAMS{\\}}},\nauthor={Xiaobing Sun and Wei Lu},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Au1gNqq4brw}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
