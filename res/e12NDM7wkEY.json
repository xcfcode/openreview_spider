The authors promised to include both works in the camera-ready version of their paper, in which case this issue is addressed. Still, we would like to emphasize that the state-of-the-art claims should be expressed a bit more carefully.\n\nWe agree with the second point of the authors. Both [A,B] avoided the use of K-Means, and directly predicted the cluster assignments using the network. The motivation for this was that K-Means can easily lead to cluster degeneracy. Taking this into consideration, the main contribution of this paper is to learn a feature space that can be directly clustered using K-Means. This marks a large deviation from prior works [A,B]. Experimentally, this paper shows that applying K-Means to the feature space outperforms the prior state-of-the-art [B], or can perform on par with the current state-of-the-art [A] in some cases. We believe it would be useful to add this discussion to the paper. \n"}, "signatures": ["~Wouter_Van_Gansbeke1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "~Wouter_Van_Gansbeke1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clustering-friendly Representation Learning via Instance Discrimination and Feature Decorrelation", "authorids": ["~Yaling_Tao1", "kentaro1.takagi@toshiba.co.jp", "kouta.nakata@toshiba.co.jp"], "authors": ["Yaling Tao", "Kentaro Takagi", "Kouta Nakata"], "keywords": ["clustering", "representation learning", "deep embedding"], "abstract": "Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in machine learning.

Please find below our responses to each of your comments.\n1.\t\"Given the two methods proposed, IDFO, IDFD, neither of which outperforms the other on all tasks, and given this is unsupervised learning, how does one know which method to use?\"\nOne of the advantages of IDFD compared with IDFO is performance stability. We plotted the accuracy values of IDFD and IDFO over the whole learning process in Figure 2. The performance of IDFO is higher than the other methods in earlier epochs. However, the accuracy widely \ufb02uctuated over the learning process and dropped in later epochs. Totally, we recommend IDFD for its performance and stability.\n2.\t\"Why was the alpha parameter set to 1 for IDFD? How does one know what to set this to for different datasets? If it's always 1, why is it included at all? This is particularly important to understand in unsupervised settings.\"\nAccording to the definition of ID and FD, two loss terms are resultantly of same order, and the $\\alpha$ parameter was simply fixed to1 in our experiments. For the general formulation of loss function with two terms, we have prepared a weight term alpha. We think it is not easy to determine a certain value of alpha for different datasets, as for the weights of many other losses.\n3.\t\"It is unclear to me whether the results in the main text include the augmentation process? If so, then given this, I think it should be stated in the main text\u2026\"\nYes, the augmentation process was included in the main results. We will state that in the main text of next revision.\n4.\t\"The results in supplementary Table 4 include KNN and don't match up with the main results in the main text which further confused me.\"\nOriginal instance discriminative method ID (original) was only evaluated by KNN metric but clustering metrics ACC, NMI, and ARI. In order to illustrate the impacts of ID (original) from data augmentation, we reserved the KNN results in our paper. We can delete it to improve the readability and clarity.\n Difference between the results of Table 1 and 4 is due to different values for parameter $\\tau_2$. We will  execute these experiments with the same parameters in the revision.\n5.\t\"I was left wondering how well this method works on non-image data? Other works in the literature have explored this.\"\nUp to now, we mainly attempted our method on image data including both open and our private data. It yielded good performance as expected. Further experiments on other data such as time-series data are undergoing.\n6.\t\"For Fig. 2 is this ACC calculated on the validation set or test set?\"\nACC in Fig.2 is calculated on the train set. Because our method does not use the label information in training, we do not prepare train/valid/test sets and simply learn the representation from a set of data and evaluate our method with the set. We used the train set for training and evaluation rather than the whole dataset for the consistency with previous works.\n7.\t\"What were the effects of resizing the ImageNet images? Can this model handle larger images, and if so, how does this effect performance?\"\nOne effect of resizing the ImageNet images is reducing the computation cost and memory consumption. Compared with CIFR-10, ImageNet consists of bigger images. We referred to the previous work DCCM to resize images. We also executed the experiment on a smaller size 32x32 and got 87.6% ACC values on ImageNet-10, which is reduced by 7% on 96x96. From this result, we expect that the performance on larger images will be improved.\n8.\t\u201cReferences are badly formatted in Table 3.\u201d\nWe will fix it in the revision.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1734/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1734/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clustering-friendly Representation Learning via Instance Discrimination and Feature Decorrelation", "authorids": ["~Yaling_Tao1", "kentaro1.takagi@toshiba.co.jp", "kouta.nakata@toshiba.co.jp"], "authors": ["Yaling Tao", "Kentaro Takagi", "Kouta Nakata"], "keywords": ["clustering", "representation learning", "deep embedding"], "abstract": "Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in machine learning.

I particularly appreciate the fact that the authors used datasets that are somewhat larger than often used in the literature (MNIST and CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-10). The inclusion of the study of the temperature parameter also helped clarify a few questions I had when reading it. \n\tC) Finally, the evaluation clearly shows the benefit of their contributions in terms of performance. \n\t\nThere are a number of questions I have with the work as is.\n\tA) Given the two methods proposed,  IDFO, IDFD, neither of which outperforms the other on all tasks, and given this is unsupervised learning, how does one know which method to use?\n\tB) Why was the alpha parameter set to 1 for IDFD? How does one know what to set this to for different datasets? If it's always 1, why is it included at all?  This is particularly important to understand in unsupervised settings. \n\tC) The impact of data augmentation is discussed in the supplementary but this is stated as being extremely important to the performance of the model. It is unclear to me whether the results in the main text include the augmentation process?  If so, then given this, I think it should be stated in the main text as it has an effect on both instance discrimination and feature decorrelation considering the addition of augmented images.  The results in supplementary Table 4 include KNN and don't match up with the main results in the main text which further confused me.\n\tD) I was left wondering how well this method works on non-image data? Other works in the literature have explored this. \n\tE) For Fig. 2 is this ACC calculated on the validation set or test set?\n\tF) What were the effects of resizing the ImageNet images? Can this model handle larger images, and if so, how does this effect performance?\n\nMinor\n\tA) References are badly formatted in Table 3.\n\t\n\nOverall, my questions above notwithstanding, I think this is an interesting contribution which shows the benefit of instance discrimination and feature decorrelation for deep clustering.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1734/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1734/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Clustering-friendly Representation Learning via Instance Discrimination and Feature Decorrelation", "authorids": ["~Yaling_Tao1", "kentaro1.takagi@toshiba.co.jp", "kouta.nakata@toshiba.co.jp"], "authors": ["Yaling Tao", "Kentaro Takagi", "Kouta Nakata"], "keywords": ["clustering", "representation learning", "deep embedding"], "abstract": "Clustering is one of the most fundamental tasks in machine learning.
