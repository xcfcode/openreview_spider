We have added the results to the Appendix D of the revised draft.\n\n2. It is an insightful suggestion to use distribution matching methods for knowledge graph alignment, as these methods are more stable in terms of optimization.\n\nThe distribution matching methods typically match the distributions of entity embeddings and relation embeddings independently between the source and target knowledge graphs. However, they ignore matching the local knowledge graph structures (i.e., triplets) during alignment. Such local structure matching can be achieved by our approach through using the REINFORCE algorithm. More specifically, our approach aligns each source triplet to a concrete target triplet, and further treats the plausibility of the target triplet as reward to adjust the alignment function.\n\nIndeed, in our experiment, UWT (Conneau et al., 2017) is a baseline algorithm which uses distribution matching for alignments. As shown in the paper, our approach outperforms UWT in the unsupervised setting. For the supervised setting, we conduct additional experiments on the WK15k(en-fr) dataset, where we use the same supervised method for pre-training, and then train the alignment functions with either distribution matching or REINFORCE. The Hit@1 of the distribution matching method is 25.60 (en2fr) and 25.45 (fr2en), whereas the Hit@1 of our approach is 35.88 (fr2en) and 35.54 (en2fr), which indicates the effectiveness of our method.\n\nAgain, thank you for the valuable comments.

We are aware of this paper. Indeed, both our paper and the KBGAN paper use the adversarial learning framework, which has been widely used for a variety of problems. However, our paper is fundamentally different from the KBGAN paper. The goal of the KBGAN paper is to use the GAN framework to generate effective negative samples for knowledge graph embedding, while our work studies a very different problem, that is, knowledge graph alignment. We use the adversarial learning framework to learn effective mapping functions to align entities and relations across different knowledge graphs. Moreover, a major challenge in knowledge graph alignment is that the entities (or relations) in the source knowledge graph could be mapped to only a subset of entities (or relations) in the target knowledge graph. We propose to maximize the mutual information between the source entities (relations) and the mapped entities (relations) to mitigate this problem.\n\nAccording to your comments, we have cited the KBGAN paper and discussed it in related work, and also fixed the typos you point out.\n\nAgain, thank you for the valuable suggestions.

Specifically, they utilize a triple discriminator to discriminate the aligned source triples and target triples, and a reward function to minimize the divergence between source triples and target triples. Also, they propose to leverage the lower bound of the mean KL divergence (mutual information) to resolve the mode collapse problem. The proposed method can be incorporated with a supervised method to be a weakly-supervised approach. Even though there are a family of unsupervised approaches for domain alignment, this paper is the first to solve the knowledge graph alignment problem in an unsupervised/weakly supervised way.\n\nStrength:\n1.\tThe paper addresses a critical knowledge graph alignment problem using GAN based on triplets, not usually entity alignment in literature, but also considers the relation alignment in knowledge graph.\n2.\tThe paper tries to solve the problem in an unsupervised way, and shows the on-par performance with weakly supervised methods in FB15k dataset.\n3.\tThe paper considers mode collapse problem and tries to solve the problem via mutual information rather than mean KL divergence, also gives the theoretical proof.\n4.\tDetailed experimental analysis and ablation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed method on small datasets.\n5.\tThe paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\n\nI have two concerns as follows:\n1.\tThe authors conduct experiments on multiple small KG datasets such as FB15K and WK15K. But the reviewer finds that the baseline papers authors mentioned also have experiments on larger datasets like WK120K (Chen et al., 2017a), WK60k, DBP-WD or DBP YG (Sun et al., 2018a). It is essential to conduct the experiment on larger datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n2.\tIs it necessary to construct a reward function to update the alignment function using REINFORCE algorithm? For instance, current distribution matching methods can define the discrepancy between the two distributions (such as target distribution and aligned source distribution). It can directly optimize the loss in an end-to-end differentiable way instead of a reinforcement learning way. It can avoid the sampling and provide a more stable optimization process.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1066/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1066/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["meng.qu@umontreal.ca", "jian.tang@hec.ca", "yoshua.bengio@mila.quebec"], "title": "Weakly-supervised Knowledge Graph Alignment with Adversarial Learning", "authors": ["Meng Qu", "Jian Tang", "Yoshua Bengio"], "pdf": "/pdf/cdacfcbed90f4ba17ce9aa8c16d3b1995dcf32a2.pdf", "abstract": "This paper studies aligning knowledge graphs from different sources or languages.
