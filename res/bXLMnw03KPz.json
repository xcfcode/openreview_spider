On the positive side, the experimental evaluation support the theoretical results.

", "comment": "**[empirical estimates of P(s), P(y) and P(y,s)]** The reviewer is correct in observing that the way the batch algorithm is set up, the required sample complexity scales linearly with the cardinality of $\\cal S$ and $\\cal Y$. Having said that, we show in Figure 2 and experiment with $\\cal S = \\{2^{18}\\}$. On the other hand, we also note that the stochastic algorithm does not require consistency of such estimates and an unbiased estimate suffices for convergence guarantees. We added a discussion in Section 4.1 to note the linear dependence on $|{\\cal S}|$ and $|{\\cal Y}|$ (i.e., exponential dependence on the number of sensitive attributes) as well as connecting it with the stochastic algorithm.\n\n**[point out known results]** To the best of our knowledge Theorems 1/2/3 are not observed in the literature. We have made connections with existing pieces and lemmas that we were aware of. Having said that, since ERMI is inherently an $f$-divergence, we would not be surprised if there are other pieces of related work that we may have missed.\n\n**[ In addition, is there any other transformation of Renyi Mutual Information that can achieve the same goal?]** \nWe believe that regularization with Renyi mutual information of order 2 should potentially give the same fairness violation/performance tradeoff as ERMI given that ERMI and Renyi mutual information of order 2 are related via a smooth monotone mapping. However, one of the big advantages of ERMI is that per Theorem 5, it is amenable to stochastic optimization leading to our stochastic version of the FERMI algorithm (Algorithm 1) that could be used within the modern stochastic optimization framework of large-scale neural architectures.\n\n**[tightness of bounds]** We answered this question in our response to Reviewer 3. We repeat our response here for completeness: Conceptually the difference between these various notions of fairness is similar to the difference between various types of norms (e.g., $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_\\infty$). While different norms will bound each other, these bounds could be arbitrarily loose for large alphabet sizes, which we suspect would be the case for our results as well. The slack in the bounds is natural in our context and indeed not the point. Notice that there is no universally accepted notion of fairness violation in the literature. The existing notions of fairness violation are not necessarily comparable (e.g., mutual information and conditional demographic parity $L_\\infty$ violation). This raises the question of which one (if any) to select in practice for imposing fairness.  A natural approach is to use a violation notion that subsumes (bounds from above) all of these existing notions of fairness violation. Using a regularizer that bounds all notions leads to a trained model that is almost universally accepted under different notions of fairness proposed in the community. In addition to this benefit, from an optimization viewpoint, FERMI regularizer is smooth and is amenable to stochastic optimization (as shown in Section 4). These properties will allow the scalable training of ML models using FERMI regularizer. This is in contrast to many other regularizers in the literature, such as RFI in (Baharlouei et al. 2020), that are non-smooth (and also not amenable to stochastic implementation) which prevents them to be applied in large-scale problems.\n\n**[performance of FERMI]** We added a discussion to Section 6 to clarify this point.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1913/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1913/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "FERMI: Fair Empirical Risk Minimization via Exponential R\u00e9nyi Mutual Information", "authorids": ["~Rakesh_Pavan1", "lowya@usc.edu", "~Sina_Baharlouei1", "~Meisam_Razaviyayn1", "~Ahmad_Beirami1"], "authors": ["Rakesh Pavan", "Andrew Lowy", "Sina Baharlouei", "Meisam Razaviyayn", "Ahmad Beirami"], "keywords": ["algorithmic fairness"], "abstract": "Several notions of fairness, such as demographic parity and equal opportunity, are defined based on statistical independence between a predicted target and a sensitive attribute.

Here, we address shared concerns and then respond to each of the reviewer\u2019s comments individually\n\n**[contribution]** We propose ERMI as a strong notion of fairness violation that provides guarantees on other existing notions of fairness violation (Theorems 1-3). In addition, ERMI is smooth, and more importantly, it is amenable to stochastic optimization (Theorem 5). This led us to the development of batch and stochastic methods for solving empirical risk minimization with an ERMI regularizer (FERMI). The stochastic solver is particularly important because it is applicable to large-scale optimization problems with neural network models (and we provide one such experiment in Section 5.3). We are unaware of any other in-process algorithm that could be applied to such large-scale problems. From a practical perspective, we observe that FERMI leads to a better tradeoff between performance and fairness violation even when such violation is measured in notions other than ERMI. We end the paper with a discussion on the potential reasons for this superior performance.\n\n**[tightness of the bounds]** Several reviewers ask about the tightness of the bounds in Theorems 1-3. We believe that it should be possible to construct examples where these bounds are arbitrarily loose for large alphabet sizes, similarly to how $L_q$ norms are related with each other for different values of $q$. However, that is beside the point of these bounds. Currently, there is no agreed upon notion of fairness violation in the community. These guarantees motivate the use of ERMI as a unifying notion of fairness, because Theorems 1-3 shows that by providing guarantees on ERMI, one can obtain guarantees on all other notions of fairness violation.\n\n**[sample complexity requirements]** Several reviewers question the sample complexity requirements for naively estimating ERMI from samples in the batch algorithm. While we agree with the reviewers that the sample complexity of estimating the distributions $p(s)$, $p(\\hat{y})$, and $p(s, \\hat{y})$ scales exponentially with the number of the sensitive attributes, we have developed stochastic FERMI for large-scale problems. We notice that stochastic FERMI (Algorithm 1) developed in Section 4.3 does not require such sample complexity as it only requires an unbiased estimator of the distributions of sensitive attributes and targets for it to converge. It remains an open question on how many samples it requires to converge to the exponential Renyi mutual information but we suspect such sample complexity is more favorable than other notions of fairness violation measures due to the existing results on the estimation of Renyi entropy of order 2 [1].\n\n[1] Acharya, J., Orlitsky, A., Suresh, A.T. and Tyagi, H., 2014, December. The complexity of estimating R\u00e9nyi entropy. In Proceedings of the twenty-sixth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms (pp. 1855-1869). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\n\n**[superiority of FERMI]**\nOne possible reason is that the objective function is easier to optimize than the objectives of competing in-processing methods: ERMI is smooth; and in the discrete case, is equal to the trace of a matrix (see Theorem 8), which is easy to compute. Contrast this with the larger computational overhead of Renyi correlation, for example, which requires finding the second singular value of a matrix. Furthermore, the sample complexity of estimating Renyi mutual information of order $2$ (and consequently that of ERMI) scales as $\\Theta(\\sqrt{|{\\cal S}|})$ as compared to Shannon mutual information which scales as $\\Theta(|{\\cal S}|/\\log |{\\cal S}|)$ [1]. Another possible explanation is that ERMI is a stronger notion of fairness than all of the most widely used fairness notions, as shown in Sec. 3, which might lead to better generalization. Together, these facts suggest that ERMI serves as an efficient and easily optimizable proxy for these other notions, leading to better practical performance regardless of which fairness measure is used. We leave it as future work to rigorously understand  which of these (or other) factors are responsible for the favorable performance tradeoffs observed from FERMI. Finally, on the Color MNIST experiment with neural network function approximation, we observed that stochastic FERMI outperforms batch FERMI.

We now show how Definition 2 specializes to the cases of interest when the fairness notion of interest is demographic parity, equalized odds, or equal opportunity in Appendix B. To the specific point of the reviewer, please note that $I(X;Y|Z)$ is also defined in a similar manner to ERMI. In this case, $I(X;Y|Z) = 0$ implies the conditional independence of $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$. ERMI has a similar implication because ERMI is an $f$-divergence, and this general property holds for all $f$-divergences, as discussed in Appendix B.\n\n**[D_R(\\hat Y_\\theta, S)]** We thank the reviewer for this comment; we now explicitly define this notion in Eq.

For example, given that ERMI and Renyi mutual information of order 2 are related via a bijective mapping, we suspect that their tradeoff curve should be similar under certain conditions. Having said that, a big advantage of ERMI is that we are able to develop a stochastic solver for it through Theorem 5, and apply it to large-scale optimization problems.

We point to the existing literature for the already known lemmas and techniques.\n\n**[Tightness of Theorems 1/2/3]** Conceptually the difference between these various notions of fairness is similar to the difference between various types of norms (e.g., $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_\\infty$). While different norms will bound each other, these bounds could be arbitrarily loose for large alphabet sizes, which we suspect would be the case for our results as well. The slack in the bounds is natural in our context and indeed not the point. Notice that there is no universally accepted notion of fairness violation in the literature. The existing notions of fairness violation are not necessarily comparable (e.g., mutual information and conditional demographic parity $L_\\infty$ violation). This raises the question of which one (if any) to select in practice for imposing fairness.  A natural approach is to use a violation notion that subsumes (bounds from above) all of these existing notions of fairness violation. Using a regularizer that bounds all notions leads to a trained model that is almost universally accepted under different notions of fairness proposed in the community. In addition to this benefit, from an optimization viewpoint, FERMI regularizer is smooth and is amenable to stochastic optimization (as shown in Section 4). These properties will allow the scalable training of ML models using FERMI regularizer. This is in contrast to many other regularizers in the literature, such as RFI in (Baharlouei et al. 2020), that are non-smooth (and also not amenable to stochastic implementation) which prevents them to be applied in large-scale problems.\n\n**[Justification of (13)]** Equation (13) is natural in problem instances where the decisions made by the learning algorithm are soft decisions. This covers a wide range of classification methods such as logistic regression or classification via neural networks with the last layer being the popular softmax layer. Having said that, our general framework is not limited to this choice and as long as we can take the derivative of the objective in (12) w.r.t. \\theta, one can still rely on our framework. We included this discussion in the paper. \n \n**[Algorithm 1]** Your concern about the empirical estimates in (16) (equation (14) in the new version) is valid for the batch algorithm, and we added a discussion around this in Section 4.1. However, Algorithm 1 is a stochastic algorithm and is applicable with a batch size as small as 1. In this case, we only need an unbiased estimate of those said densities for the algorithm to converge, which is provided by the empirical estimates. We added this explanation after equation (16) in the paper. \n\n**[Experiments]** In the binary classification case with a binary sensitive attribute, not only ERMI is equal to Renyi correlation, but also our batch algorithm is exactly equivalent to that of RFI (Baharlouei et al. 2020). While we had already stated this in Section 4.1, we also added a note in Section 5.1 to make this clear.

ERMI is easy to compute and provides an upper bound on existing notions. Based on ERMI, the authors propose a framework, FERMI, which can be optimized with SGD with convergence guarantee. In experiments, results show that FERMI leads to a better tradeoff between performance and fairness even if fairness is not measured by ERMI.\n\nMy major concern about the methodology is that it depends on the quality of the empirical estimate of the probability distributions P(s), P(y) and P(y,s). In the experiments, these distributions are relatively simple as S takes either binary values or are samples from Gaussian distribution. And Y is discrete and takes few values. I wonder how the performance of the FERMI would be influenced by the quality of estimates of the three probability distributions. It would be interesting if the authors can show results on the estimation error of the three vs. the performance of FERMI.\n\nIn section 3, the authors show that ERMI is an upperbound of several popular notions: Shannon MI, Renyi correlation, and Lq fairness violation. I have several suggestions and questions: (1) It would be better to specify whether some of them are known before this work. (2) In addition, is there any other transformation of Renyi Mutual Information that can achieve the same goal?

As certain notions of fairness can be encoded using (conditional) independence, this paper propose to use some information theory notions of mutual information to quantify this degree of (conditional) independence, which indirectly translates to the degree of fairness. A classification algorithm with low value of mutual information between the prediction and the sensitive attributes can be considered as fair.\n\nThe paper establishes that the Exponential Renyi Mutual Information is a strong notion to ensure fairness: the authors show that this notion is stronger than many existing notions such as Lq fairness, etc. The authors propose an algorithm to train a fair classifier, with the mutual information being penalized in the objective function.\n\nStrength:\n- The idea of combining information theory notions to measure independency and applying it to fair machine learning is natural.\n\nWeakness:\n- I have some concerns with the mathematical notations in this paper.\ni) The definition 2 is very misleading. Consider for equalized odds with \\mathcal Z = \\{0, 1\\}: it is not clear to me why this definition correctly capture the conditional independence. To my best understanding, the conditioning here should be taken as 2 separate conditional expectation: one conditional expectation with Z = 0, and another conditional expectation with Z = 1. The mathematical definition in equation (2) does not seem to segregate the values of Z. Moreover, why is the expectation taken over Z when we already condition on Z \\in \\mathcal Z?\nii) What is D_R(\\hat Y_\\theta, S) in equation (11)? I guess the authors mean the D_R function with condition as in equation (2)?\n\n- The authors show that ERMI is stronger than existing notions, which is nice. However, it is not clear why a stronger notion is preferable for the penalized optimization of the form (11). One can think of penalizing the Shannon mutual information with higher penalty parameter lambda, and one may expect to see similar end results as problem (11) -- especially if we plot the accuracy-fairness tradeoff similar to Figure 1.\n\nMinor comments:\n- Lemma 1 is quite trivial. I think this lemma should be put as discussion in the paper, and not a separate lemma.\n- Why are the expectation in equation (15) taken with X?\n- The proof of Theorem 5 does not seem to prove what is stated in Theorem 5.\n- The notations in equation (11) can be made more explicit. For example, I think there is a dependence of \\hat Y_\\theta on X which is not made explicit.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1913/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1913/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "FERMI: Fair Empirical Risk Minimization via Exponential R\u00e9nyi Mutual Information", "authorids": ["~Rakesh_Pavan1", "lowya@usc.edu", "~Sina_Baharlouei1", "~Meisam_Razaviyayn1", "~Ahmad_Beirami1"], "authors": ["Rakesh Pavan", "Andrew Lowy", "Sina Baharlouei", "Meisam Razaviyayn", "Ahmad Beirami"], "keywords": ["algorithmic fairness"], "abstract": "Several notions of fairness, such as demographic parity and equal opportunity, are defined based on statistical independence between a predicted target and a sensitive attribute.

The strongness of the notion is claimed via the proof (Theorems 1/2/3) that the notion is an upper bound of other well-known notions like mutual information, Renyi mutual information, Renyi correlation, L1 fairness violation. Two methods for estimating the notion via samples are developed under some assumptions. The performances of the methods are then demonstrated on three datasets and compared with some prior algorithms.\n\nStrengths: \n\n1. An interesting observation is made via Theorems 1/2/3: ERMI is an upper bound of other popular notions.  \n2. Explicit algorithms are developed for estimating the notion as differential functions w.r.t. model parameters.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. While the observation in Theorems 1/2/3 is interesting, the proof relies upon the techniques in well-known literature and/or some standard tricks. Perhaps more importantly, it is not investigated in depth how tight the proposed notion is relative to other notions, except for the binary classification case. I believe the tightness analysis is more important, as a loose upper bound plays a less role. \n\n2. Algorithm 1: No justification is provided behind the assumption, in particular (13). Also no analysis is provided regarding the accuracy of the density estimates (16). In particular, this reviewer wonders whether or not the condition density estimate (the 2nd in (16)) is accurate \u2013 usually, a precise accuracy requires an exponential number of samples w.r.t. the cardinality of yhat. \n\n3. Experiments: Some baselines based on mutual information are missing, e.g., [A], [B]. Also in the 1st experiment (Fig. 1), (Baharlouei et al 2020) is missing \u2013 I think it is needed to compare, since the notion estimation method may be different although ERMI is equivalent to Renyi correlation. Moreover, it is not clear which algorithm to use in all experiments between Algorithms 1 and 2.  \n\n[A] B. Zhang, B. Lemoine, and M. Mitchell. Mitigating unwanted biases with adversarial learning.
