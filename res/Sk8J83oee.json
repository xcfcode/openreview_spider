Please see the summary of improvements with respect to results and clarity in our response to Reviewer 3. We now respond to your specific concerns.\n\nConcern 1: Choosing the single best generator using the [GAM-II] metric. In this work we viewed GAP as a training strategy and attempted to compare, \u201capples-to-apples\u201d synthesis among single generators (not ensembles). However, we agree with the reviewer that ensembling all GANs (e.g. as a mixture) has a richer modeling capacity and will likely improve quality of generated samples. While we have not explored such a strategy in this work, we are interested in this extension and intend to pursue it. Moreover, we recently found a paper that has a similar flavour to what the author suggested: AdaGAN: Boosting Generative Models (arXiv:1701.02386). It may be interesting to explore the use of GAP for training AdaGAN models. Please also see our response to Reviewer 2 for a discussion on the weakness of the GAM-II metric.\n\nConcern 2: We should provide a theoretical (or at least a conceptual) comparison to dropout.\n\nThank you for pointing out the connection between GAP and dropout. We have added a conceptual comparison to Dropout in Section 3.1.\n\nConcern 3a: The qualitative results are not convincing. Most of the [figures of generated samples] show only GAP results.\n\nWe agree that other papers often use this scheme to show samples of one GAN variant vs. another. In our experience, visually distinguishing between the samples is difficult since our improvement mainly lies on mode coverage and stability. We\u2019re not arguing that the visual quality of individual samples are better than the baseline training schemes.\n\nConcern 3b: Figures 3 and 4 are not convincing; the generator in Figure 3 was most likely under-parametrized.\n\nThe architecture of the generator and discriminator for both individually-trained and GAP-trained models are exactly the same. Not only that, the hyper-parameters were also exactly the same. The only additional parameter tuned for GAP was swapping rate. Figure 3 and 4 are merely visualizations, and we noted that one should not draw strong conclusions from them, but we do feel that it is a fair comparison. The GAP-trained models appear to utilize the fixed number of parameters more effectively.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Parallelization", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most studied frameworks for unsupervised learning due to their intuitive formulation.

This is an excellent point and we agree that GAM-II is flawed in this respect. But we believe that it is an improvement over GAM (Im et al. 2016) which also relies on discriminators. Despite its flaws, GAM-II has some other benefits compared to evaluation schemes like AIS and Inception scores: it can be performed online, it does not need any extra trained models nor data, etc.\n \nThat being said, the focus of our paper wasn't on the GAM-II metric, nor do we think that there is any single best metric for quantitatively evaluating generative models. We applied GAM-II as one of the evaluations in order to understand the performance of GAP. In response to the reviewer\u2019s suggestions, we also measured negative log-likelihood of DCGANs based on the technique proposed by (Wu et al. 2016) -- see Table 4.

The proposed GAM-II metric is circular in that model performance depends on the collection of baselines the model is being compared with. Estimating likelihood via AIS seems to be a promising way to evaluate, as does using the Inception score.\n\nPerhaps a more systematic way to determine GAP's effect would be to set up a grid search of hyperparameters and train an equal number of GANs and GAP-GANs for each setting.

We would like to kindly ask the reviewer read the latest version (revised version of the paper, because we are curious whether this review was done based on first version of the paper)\n\nRegarding 1) In our experiments (revised version of the paper), we trained 4 individual GANs  and compared with 4 GANs trained with GAP. As the reviewer said, these 4 individually trained GANs were initialized differently and the ordering of batch were permuted differently during the training. The results in table 2, 3, and 4 are based on the comparisons of 4 individually trained GANs versus 4 GANs with GAP applied. We report the best and worst error rates among 4 GANs using GAM-II and report the average and standard deviation of negative log-likelihood measured using AIS. We haven\u2019t investigated on training large capacity models with dropout versus GAP(GANs). \n\nRegarding 2) We report the inception score results in Table 5. More recently, (Wu et al. 2016. On the quantitative analysis of decoder-base generative model) have criticized that inception score heavily rely on visual quantity, and they have proposed metric based on log-likelihood. We followed Wu et al. 2016. paper and measured negative log-likelihood. This result is reported in Table 4. \n\nRegarding 3) For sure, if the gap of training and validation cost is getting larger, then the discriminator is overfitting. Not only that, as shown in Figure 6, when the training cost goes down fast (e.g. GAP(DCGANx1) dis_tr), then naturally generators cost goes up. This means that the discriminator is getting too strong compared to the generator. This phenomena happens because discriminator error signal is larger than generator. It is ideal to keep the generator and discriminator balanced during the training.  Lastly, the learning of generator and discriminator are intertwined as they depend on each other during the training. Hence, the generalization of discriminator can influence the generator learning.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Parallelization", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most studied frameworks for unsupervised learning due to their intuitive formulation.

The idea here is that no one generator-discriminator pair can be too locked together since they are all being swapped. This idea is nice and is addressing an important issue with GAN training. However, I think the paper is lacking in experimental results. In particular:\n\n- The authors need to do more work to motivate the GAM metric. It is not intuitively obvious to me that the GAM metric is a good way of evaluating the generator networks since it relies on the prediction of the discriminator networks which can fixate on artifacts. Perhaps the authors could explore if the GAM metric correlates with inception scores or human evaluations. Currently the only quantitative evaluation uses this criterion and it really isn't clear it's a relevant quantity to be measuring. \n- Related to the above comment, the authors need to compare more to other methods. Why not evaluate inception scores and compare with previous methods. Similarly, generation quality is not compared with previous methods. It's not obvious that the sample quality is any better with this method. \n\nAnd now just repeating questions from pre-review section:\n- If, instead of swapping, you were to simply train K GANs on K splits of the data, or K GANs with differing initial conditions (but without swapping) do you see any improvement in results? Similarly, how about if you train larger capacity models with dropout in G and D? Since dropout essentially averages many models it would be interesting to see if the effects are the same.\n- In figure 6 it appears that the validation costs remain the same as parallelization increase, but the training cost goes up and that is why the gap is shrinking. Does this really imply better generalization?\n\nIn summary, interesting paper that addresses an important issue with GAN training, but compelling results are missing.

GAP proceeds by shuffling the assignments between the N generators and the N discriminators at play every few epochs. Therefore, GAP forces each generator to compete with multiple discriminators at random. The authors claim that such randomization reduces undesired \"mode collapsing behaviour\", typical of GANs.\n\nI have three concerns with this submission.\n\n1) After training the N GANs for a sufficient amount of time, the authors propose to choose the best generator using the GAM metric. I oppose to this because of two reasons. First, a single GAN will most likely be unable to express the full richness of the true data begin modeled. Said differently, a single generator with limited power will either describe a mode well, or describe many modes poorly. Second, GAM relies on the scores given by the discriminators, which can be ill-posed (focus on artifacts). Since there is There is nothing wrong with mode collapsing when this happens under control. Thus, I believe that a better strategy would be to not choose and combine all generators into a mixture. Of course, this would require a way to decide on mixture weights. This can be done, for instance, using rejection sampling based on discriminator scores.\n\n2) The authors should provide a theoretical (or at least conceptual) comparison to dropout. In essence, this paper has a very similar flavour: every generator is competing against all N discriminators, but at each epoch we drop N-1 for every generator. Related to the previous point, after training dropout keeps all the neurons, effectively approximating a large ensemble of neural networks.\n\n3) The qualitative results are not convincing. Most of the figures show only results about GAP. How do the baseline samples look like? The GAN and LAPGAN papers show very similar samples. On the other hand, I do not find Figures 3 and 4 convincing: for instance, the generator in Figure 3 was most likely under-parametrized.\n\nAs a minor comment, I would remove Figure 2. This is because of three reasons: it may be protected by copyright, it occupies a lot of space, and it does not add much value to the explanation. Also, the indices (i_t) are undefined in Algorithm 1.\n\nOverall, this paper shows good ideas, but it needs further work in terms of conceptual development and experimental evaluation.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generative Adversarial Parallelization", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have become one of the most studied frameworks for unsupervised learning due to their intuitive formulation.
