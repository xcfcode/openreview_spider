The idea is interesting and the experimental results show SketchEmbedNet is able to do not only few-shot classification but also one-shot generation. \n\nOverall, I vote for rejecting. In my opinion, the main contributions of this paper are not very clear. The introduced model, SketchEmbedNet has limited novelty on neither the methodology nor the network structure. As stated in the title and introduction, the authors aim to capture and generalize the compositional information from sketch/natural images. Section 4 reports the latent variables organization performance, which is directly related to the key motivation I believe. But the authors only compared SketchEmbedNet with VAE, which is not enough to demonstrate their advantages. Moreover, it is not clear why few-shot classification and one-shot generation performance in Section 5 and 6 support their main idea. Thus, this paper needs further improvements.\n\nDetailed comments:\n(1)\tIn the first paragraph of section 2, the authors claimed that the CNN embeddings must preserve a compositional understanding of the input sketches/images to improve the performance in their pix2seq task. So how did you preserve the information? Many sketch synthesis methods, such as [8] in the reference, can reconstruct the sketch with a sketch image input. Do these methods preserve the ``compositional understanding\u2019\u2019?\n(2)\tStill in the same paragraph, I\u2019m pretty sure a vanilla auto-encoder with a CNN encoder containing average pooling layers can reconstruct a six-legs-turtle well as input. Thus, the information about the positions and the turtle legs number must be transported to decoder by the latent embeddings. So why you confirm that a regular CNN embedding cannot preserve that information after an average pooling layer? \n(3)\tThe same CNN encoder is used for both natural images and sketches. As these two types of images are with totally different patterns, many recent studies, such as reference [55], used a two-branched encoder for natural images and sketches, respectively. In this paper, the CNN backbone is a 4-layer CNN or a ResNet12, which are very basic structures. Is it able to extract the image features well?\n(4)\tFigure 5 shows SketchEmbedNet outperforms VAE on latent space organization. In my opinion, the well-organized latent space of SketchEmbedNet is mainly due to getting rid of the KL loss term, which drives the latent distribution to be a uniform distribution. I would like to see the comparison with sketch-pix2seq, which is the reference [8], as both SketchEmbedNet and sketch-pix2seq do not use KL term in training.\n(5)\tAs this paper focuses on sketch drawing, why there is no comparison between SketchEmbedNet and other sketch generative models, such as [8, 11, 15, 26] in the references? \n\n\n\n\nAfter reading the response from the authors, we raise our score by +1.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SketchEmbedNet: Learning Novel Concepts by Imitating Drawings", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Wang1", "~Mengye_Ren1", "~Richard_Zemel1"], "authors": ["Alexander Wang", "Mengye Ren", "Richard Zemel"], "keywords": ["generative", "probabilistic", "sketch", "drawing", "few-shot learning", "classification", "embedding learning"], "abstract": "Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that appeals to human instinct.

The architecture consists of a standard CNN encoder followed by an RNN decoder. The authors evaluate their learned embeddings on few-shot classification tasks and explore the the quality of the latent space. They demonstrate that they outperform unsupervised few-shot classification approaches and seem to obtain a latent space that is more aware of long-range structure than those from methods that operate purely in raster space.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of rating\n\nInterpreting and synthesizing sketches in a deep learning context is an promising research direction. While the idea of focusing on of sketch-aware embeddings of images is an interesting one, the main technical contribution simply involves taking a standard convolutional encoder with a recurrent decoder, which has already been used for sketch generation (sketch-rnn). In addition to this, some of the claims made in the paper require some clarification or additional experimentation, as I explain below. Thus, I believe that some additions and changes must be made for the paper to be accepted.\n\n---\n\n### Pros\n\n- I like the idea of using the vector structure of sketches to gain more insight into image content.\n- It is difficult to design deep networks that are able to operate on non-raster data. In some sense, this approach sidesteps this issue by allowing the relationship between raster and vector to be learned.\n- The experiments in Section 6 confirm the idea that the embeddings are aware of this high-level long-range relationships that aren't so obvious on the pixel level.\n\n---\n\n### Cons and questions\n\n- I am not sure I follow the intuition behind why the proposed model achieves better semantic awareness than a convolutional VAE. The authors use the example of a six legged turtle and state that the VAE would only retain information about a single \"leg-like feature but not how many legs are present.\" How is having an RNN stroke-based decoder different from a standard convolutional decoder in this sense? In both cases, the final reconstruction must contain the original number of legs, and so the latent vector is encouraged to retain this information.\n- The performance on natural images in Figure 4, especially on unseen classes, is not great. I would be interested to see the nearest neighbor images in the training set for the examples shown. Even in the case of unseen classes, the resulting sketches look like they might match a similar image from the training set.\n- The authors claim that balancing the stroke and and pixel losses via a curriculum mirrors how humans learn to draw (\"paint-by-numbers\"). However, I'm not sure how some of the experiments fit into this methodology. In particular, most of the experiments are done on datasets that have ground truth sketch strokes but not their ordering (e.g., SVG files). In this case, it seems like imposing an order on the strokes (and asking the decoder to replicate it) is a counterintuitive constraint for the model. On the other hand, in the natural image experiments, the pixel loss cannot be used at all. Some discussion of the consequences there would be interesting.\n- I'm not sure that it is fair to compare to fully unsupervised few-shot classification methods. While the proposed method indeed does not use class labels, the ground truth stroke information may provide considerably more information than just the raster image data. Perhaps it would help to have a baseline without stroke loss (i.e., $\\alpha=1$). Even the ablation study in Table 3 does not include this case.\n- How sensitive is the approach to quality of stroke decomposition? For instance, what happens if you subdivide each stroke in the ground truth SVGs?\n\n---\n\nThe authors have addressed many of my concerns in the rebuttal, and so I am increasing my rating.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SketchEmbedNet: Learning Novel Concepts by Imitating Drawings", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Wang1", "~Mengye_Ren1", "~Richard_Zemel1"], "authors": ["Alexander Wang", "Mengye Ren", "Richard Zemel"], "keywords": ["generative", "probabilistic", "sketch", "drawing", "few-shot learning", "classification", "embedding learning"], "abstract": "Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that appeals to human instinct.

Is the output of the model still the same?\n\nThank you for the suggestion but we would like to make some clarifications before we consider this ablation study.\n\nOur model only uses stroke information during the batched training task in Section 4. Any embedding used in Sections 5, 6, 7 is produced by the CNN encoder from Section 4 which only takes in a pixel image. This means that evaluating the impact of subdivision and shuffling on our latent space would entail shuffling/slicing the Quickdraw/Sketchy training data from Section 4, repeating those experiments and then re-evaluating Sections 5, 6 and 7.\n\nFurthermore, our Section 4 training data already contains varying stroke trajectories and subdivisions (which you have also noticed is not hugely significant given our data representation). Quickdraw examples contain many images that are drawn with different or divided trajectories, for example, circles drawn clockwise or counterclockwise. Sketchy further extends this by having up to 10 unique stroke \u201clabels\u201d for each natural-image input as per the original dataset. We could reshuffle or slice these examples but this would only at best shift our training distribution in Section 4.

Some of the comments and citations do not appear to match the paper we submitted. We discuss compositional information in section 6, and few-show classification and one-shot generation in Sections 5 and 7 respectively. We have not used any bracket-style citations and citations 8, 11, 15, 26 do not all refer to sketching models, additionally, we do not have 55 citations in this work. However, we believe we are able to infer that [8] refers to sketch-pix2seq by Chen et al. (2017) and [55] refers to \u201cLearning to sketch with shortcut cycle consistency\u201d by Song et al. (2018) and will respond with this in mind. We are unable to identify references 11, 15 and 26.\n\nA general comment; our submission is exploring a novel setting where we train an image-to-sketch model on a very large number of classes to learn a generalized drawer and embedding function for downstream tasks. We demonstrate that this challenging task learns a unique embedding that captures salient and compositional visual information that we support by our experiments in Sections 5, 6 and 7. While it is a model that can sketch, we cannot directly compare to drawing models focused on producing drawings of few or singular classes and/or do not sketch image inputs. \n\n> How did you preserve the information [of compositional input images]? Many sketch synthesis methods, such as [8] in the reference, can reconstruct the sketch with a sketch image input. Do these methods preserve the ``compositional understanding\u2019\u2019?\n\nLike some other sketching methods, we motivate the preservation of salient and informative features through the use of our sequential RNN decoder. However, of these methods, only Sketch-pix2seq could potentially learn this information for rasterized image data and unlike our approach is limited in class scope and not intended for use on downstream tasks.\n\n> A vanilla auto-encoder with a CNN encoder containing average pooling layers can reconstruct a six-legs-turtle well as input. Thus, the information about the positions and the turtle legs number must be transported to decoder by the latent embeddings. So why you confirm that a regular CNN embedding cannot preserve that information after an average pooling layer?\n\nWe present this observation from existing literature on CNN encoders with only pixel-reconstruction objectives. We have also rewritten this section to better convey our observation that it is the explicit, sequential generation of components by an RNN that leads to this awareness.\n\n> In this paper, the CNN backbone is a 4-layer CNN or a ResNet12, which are very basic structures. Is it able to extract the image features well?\n\nYes we do believe our CNN backbone is capable of extracting meaningful image features. If our encoder has not extracted any salient information, we would not expect our results especially in few-shot classification.\n\n> In my opinion, the well-organized latent space of SketchEmbedNet is mainly due to getting rid of the KL loss term, which drives the latent distribution to be a uniform distribution. I would like to see the comparison with sketch-pix2seq, which is the reference [8], as both SketchEmbedNet and sketch-pix2seq do not use KL term in training.\n\nWe do not explore latent space class disentanglement in the same way as Sketch-pix2seq. Our results in Section 6 are focused on understanding component spatial relationships in image space, and conceptual composition. The image examples embedded in Figure 5-A and 5-B are not classes that have been encountered by SketchEmbedNet but are synthetic examples created to demonstrate this understanding. Furthermore, this is only possible given our ability to encode general image inputs. \n\nHowever, to address your concern regarding the impact of  the KL term, we have repeated the experiments in Section 6 both using a standard autoencoder (a VAE without KL regularization) and a SketchEmbedNet trained with the KL objective. We do find that performance on the linear classification and regression tasks improve as we reduce KL regularization and have removed the experiment from our paper. However, SketchEmbeddings outperform all autoencoder based methods in our other experiments in section 6. We include the full set of results considering KL regularization in Appendix sections I and L.\n\n> As this paper focuses on sketch drawing, why there is no comparison between SketchEmbedNet and other sketch generative models, such as [8, 11, 15, 26] in the references?\n\nThis is addressed in the general comments. While our model is a sketching model, we learn a mapping for different domains (general image inputs to sketch outputs) and class breadths that does not meaningfully compare to existing sketch models.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SketchEmbedNet: Learning Novel Concepts by Imitating Drawings", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Wang1", "~Mengye_Ren1", "~Richard_Zemel1"], "authors": ["Alexander Wang", "Mengye Ren", "Richard Zemel"], "keywords": ["generative", "probabilistic", "sketch", "drawing", "few-shot learning", "classification", "embedding learning"], "abstract": "Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that appeals to human instinct.

The combination of this with a convolutional encoder is what allows us to demonstrate the salient and compositional nature of SketchEmbeddings and broad effectiveness for classical image-domain tasks.\n\n> The authors use the example of a six legged turtle and state that the VAE would only retain information about a single \"leg-like feature but not how many legs are present.\" How is having an RNN stroke-based decoder different from a standard convolutional decoder in this sense?\n\nThe difference is that an RNN decoder must sequentially and explicitly generate each element, which learns a greater component level awareness. A raster based reconstruction does not have this componential understanding and only matches pixels. We have updated this passage in our manuscript to better communicate the idea.\n\n> The performance on natural images in Figure 4, especially on unseen classes, is not great. I would be interested to see the nearest neighbor images in the training set for the examples shown. Even in the case of unseen classes, the resulting sketches look like they might match a similar image from the training set.\n\nWhile better drawings are desirable, it is not our primary focus to produce the most high-fidelity sketches. We find that our approach is capable of producing sketches that capture the major shapes of subjects in the image and that the distilled embedding of this information is sufficient to drive competitive performance in few-shot classification. The key demonstration that the model is not simply indexing into the training images comes from the few-shot classification results, which show that the embeddings are capable of discriminating between examples of completely novel classes. \n\n> The authors claim that balancing the stroke and and pixel losses via a curriculum mirrors how humans learn to draw (\"paint-by-numbers\"). \u2026 In particular, most of the experiments are done on datasets that have ground truth sketch strokes but not their ordering (e.g., SVG files). \n> Perhaps it would help to have a baseline without stroke loss (i.e., \u03b1=1). Even the ablation study in Table 3 does not include this case.\n\nThe SVG data from datasets like Sketchy include timestamps over all paths of how the sketch was initially drawn. We preserve this sequence by sampling along those paths to obtain our training data. We have added a comment about this in the paper, to clarify how we use the SVG data. We have attempted to train models using only the pixel loss (\u03b1=1) but the model fails to converge thus our motivation for the paint-by-numbers approach.\n\n> On the other hand, in the natural image experiments, the pixel loss cannot be used at all. Some discussion of the consequences there would be interesting.\n\nThis is not quite correct -- the pixel loss is used for natural image training. In our natural image training data from Sketchy we have stroke information for each training example. We convert this to an image via our rasterization and compare it to the drawing produced by our model, in order to compute pixel loss.\n\n> I'm not sure that it is fair to compare to fully unsupervised few-shot classification methods. While the proposed method indeed does not use class labels, the ground truth stroke information may provide considerably more information than just the raster image data.\n\nWe have added a note in Table 1 and 2 to clarify this. While stroke data arguably contains more information we do not see it as a problem as we demonstrate that the learned information is informative and transferable across data domains. While Omniglot contains some stroke distribution, learning only to draw Quickdraw\u2019s distribution addresses the task; while mini-ImageNet has no stroke distribution, learning to summarize natural images in the style of Sketchy is still informative for the former.\n\n>How sensitive is the approach to quality of stroke decomposition? For instance, what happens if you subdivide each stroke in the ground truth SVGs?\n\nSubdividing SVGs does not have a significant impact on our model. Our data is not in the form of a set of paths but a sequence of points. Subdividing a path in SVG data would equate to lifting and then immediately replacing the pen to the drawing canvas.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SketchEmbedNet: Learning Novel Concepts by Imitating Drawings", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Wang1", "~Mengye_Ren1", "~Richard_Zemel1"], "authors": ["Alexander Wang", "Mengye Ren", "Richard Zemel"], "keywords": ["generative", "probabilistic", "sketch", "drawing", "few-shot learning", "classification", "embedding learning"], "abstract": "Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that appeals to human instinct.

While the regularizer is useful to prevent memorization and reproducing the exact image input, we are performing image to sketch transfer so this issue is less of a concern. We expanded the discussion of this in the paper, and have included this as an additional entry in the table in Appendix I.\n\n> What happens when you provide the class labels and train the model with classification errors as well? Will it improve the test result? If so, how much?\n\nWe agree that this is interesting, as one would expect using labels would learn a more discriminative embedding.We ran this experiment and found that learning with class-labels during the supervised training stage worsens classification accuracy -- we have included these results in Appendix L. While sketching is informative across classes and data distributions, explicit classification tasks do not seem to be.\n\n> May have been much more interesting if this paper explores the unsupervised disentanglement in latent space, to support their claims for what they note as structured embeddings.

We demonstrate salience in Sections 5 and 7 by showing that sketching is an informative task that produces embeddings that lead to strong few-shot classification results, and by generating recognizable examples from them. We showcase an understanding of component composition in image space and conceptual composition in our experiments in section 6. The introduction and experimental sections have been updated with additional discussion to better connect our claims with these results.\n\n> Does not include any ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each components of the proposed model.\n\nWe ablate a key term, the pixel loss, by varying the \u03b1max coefficient. We also investigated ablating the stroke loss, by setting \u03b1=1, but this fails to converge motivating our curriculum learning schedule. Ablating the pen loss would mean our output pen states would be generally unlearned. Other modifications, such as altering the encoder-decoder architecture, either changes our problem formulation entirely or makes our model a Conv-VAE. \n\n> [The main contribution of this paper is] to utilize the sequential sketch data during the supervised training time. This needs to be clearly stated, particularly inside the tables, as most baselines only use sketch images, not their sequential data.\n\nWe view our contribution as showing that learning to draw via the sequential sketch data is a useful task for learning visual concepts. We do agree that this additional information used during training is not used by the methods we are comparing to in the few-shot classification results, and have made sure to highlight this in the revised version (with a note next to the tables). Nonetheless we want to emphasize that this additional information is only present during training time yet transfers well for other datasets (Quickdraw -> Omniglot, Sketchy -> mini-ImageNet) with only image inputs during test time. We think it is an interesting contribution to show that adding this auxiliary sketch information during training, on different datasets and different classes, can help few-shot classification.\n\n> For instance, the results from Table 4, if we look closely, the authors' results use ResNet12 trained with Sketchy data, which quite differs from other results in the list.\n\nAll results in Table 4 use the same architecture. If you are referring to Table 2, we have provided additional comparisons with a Conv-VAE using a ResNet12 backbone as well as SketchEmbedNet using the Conv4 architecture. ResNet12 was selected to accommodate the increased challenge in sketching natural images as the model must handle color and identify the subject. While our Conv4 results are comparable or weaker than existing methods we believe that even without state-of-the-art, our use of sketch information for visual tasks is an interesting and novel contribution."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SketchEmbedNet: Learning Novel Concepts by Imitating Drawings", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Wang1", "~Mengye_Ren1", "~Richard_Zemel1"], "authors": ["Alexander Wang", "Mengye Ren", "Richard Zemel"], "keywords": ["generative", "probabilistic", "sketch", "drawing", "few-shot learning", "classification", "embedding learning"], "abstract": "Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that appeals to human instinct.

Will it improve the test result? If so, how much? \n- May have been much more interesting if this paper explores the unsupervised disentanglement in latent space, to support their claims for what they note as structured embeddings.

The manuscript is written clearly and concisely. Methods have been presented with enough detail and seem accurate. Particularly, the results from the Quickdraw and Omniglot datasets showing generated sketches are rather impressive, and the ones for the natural images seem promising. Overall, I very much enjoyed reading the paper and suggest it for publication without any major changes.\n\nIn my view the results presented in Figure 5, and especially 5C, are the most impressive and interesting ones. These results deserve more space in the manuscript. I was curious to know whether there were also many unsuccessful conceptual composition examples. Are the examples shown in Figure 5C the best ones, or are they representative of performance in general? Does this approach also work with natural images to any extent? Could the authors elaborate on why or why not this may be the case?\n\n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper754/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "SketchEmbedNet: Learning Novel Concepts by Imitating Drawings", "authorids": ["~Alexander_Wang1", "~Mengye_Ren1", "~Richard_Zemel1"], "authors": ["Alexander Wang", "Mengye Ren", "Richard Zemel"], "keywords": ["generative", "probabilistic", "sketch", "drawing", "few-shot learning", "classification", "embedding learning"], "abstract": "Sketch drawings are an intuitive visual domain that appeals to human instinct. Previous work has shown that recurrent neural networks are capable of producing sketch drawings of a single or few classes at a time.

We find that the embeddings learned by this sketching model are extremely informative for visual tasks and infer a unique visual understanding.
