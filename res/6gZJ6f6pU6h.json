The key idea includes two folds: (1) to align label-wise moment, and (2) to ensemble multiple feature extractor. Experimental studies on 3 datasets are done to verify the proposed MUTL-EPL.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written. The technical approach is simple and sound. My major concern is on the technical significance of the method. Here are the detailed comments:\n\n(1)\tOne motivation of the paper is that current methods fail to consider the shifts among sources. However, there are some multiple source transfer methods explicitly modelling the inter-domain similarities, e.g., [ref1].  The paper also misses some important multiple-source references. Please refer to the survey [ref2] for different types of multiple source transfer methods. It would be better to have a comprehensive discussion on the related works.\n\n(2)\tThe proposed label-wise moment matching is not new in transfer. Early subspace based work, e.g., JDA [ref3], and latest semantic deep learning based transfer methods, e.g., [ref4] share the similar idea. \n\n(3)\tThe threshold \\taw is used to obtain the good target labels.  On the one hand, it is unclear how this parameter should be set for different transfer tasks. On the other hand, high confidence score does not imply correct target label prediction. Error reinforcement may happen even with a well-tuned \\taw.\n\n(4)\tThe usage of ensemble feature extractor is actually using high complexity to enhance prediction accuracy. The scalability could be an issue of the proposed method, especially considering that multiple source may have extremely large data size. \n\n(5)\tSensitivity analyses on the balancing parameters \\alpha and \\beta should be done. \n\n(6)\tWhy data augmentation is done on office-caltech10 datasets? There are many datasets containing multiple domains with sufficient data, e.g., office-home, Please use these datasets instead of constructing `artificial\u2019 real-world dataset. \n\n(7)\tThe baseline methods can be further improved (please consider [ref2] for more baselines). Regarding the current results, MUTLT-EPL performs larger improvements over M3SDA on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tasks in Digit \u2013five dataset, while only achieves marginal improvements in other tasks, e.g.. tasks in office-caltech10 dataset. More analyses on the performance difference of different tasks should be discussed. \n\n(8)\tBased on the ablation study, Mutil-epl-r achieves comparable results with multi-epl, which indicates that the extractor classifier and feature diversifying loss have less importance in the overall objective. \n\n[ref1] Source-target similarity modelings for multi-source transfer gaussian process regression\n\n[ref2] Multi-source Domain Adaptation in the Deep Learning Era: A Systematic Survey\n\n[ref3] Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation\n\n[ref4] Deep Transfer Learning with Joint Adaptation Networks\n\nUpdate: Thanks for the authors' response. However, I am not convinced on several points, e.g., (3) - (7). Considering the other reviewers' comments, I think the paper needs to be further improved.

The authors argue that the existing MSDA solutions (1) do not explicitly consider distribution conditioned on labels of each domain, (2) rely on limited feature extraction based on one extractor, (3) do not well explore target data due to the absence of label. Correspondingly, Multi-EPL is proposed based on moment matching.  \n\nAlthough the design of the proposed method seems reasonable, its novelty is marginal. Additionally, the evaluation in the experiments is somewhat unfair. I vote for rejection.\n\nThe paper is well organized. The technical details are clearly presented. A few comments are summarized below.\n-In Eq.1, the authors minimize the discrepancy between every two distinct domains. It is unclear to me why not minimize the pairs of each source domain and target domain, (N-pairs). The goal is to align the distributions between source and target. Please clarify the motivation of aligning two source domains. \n\nBesides, it would be good to have one baseline only considering label-wise moment matching losses for only between N source and 1 target pairs.\n\n-In page 5, the motivation of diversifying features from different extractors is unclear to me. Please clarify the benefit of classifying feature according to extractor ID labels. Moreover, the ablation study presented in section 5.3, does not show a clear improvement by introducing the diversifying loss. I would encourage the authors to design another analytical experiment to show its effectiveness.\n\n-The performance improvement compared to the state of the arts is limited. Specifically, for Digit-Five dataset, a missing recent work [ref-1] reports an average performance of 91.8. To show the consistent performance improvement over this strong baseline, I\u2019d encourage the authors cite and compare it under the same setting.\n[ref-1] Hang Wang et al., Learning to Combine: Knowledge Aggregation for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation, ECCV 2020\n\n-Besides [ref-1], there are several other recent MSDA papers are missing, including but not limited to\n[ref-2] Chuang Lin et al., Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Visual Sentiment Classification, https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03886 \n[ref-3] Haotian Wang et al., Tmda: Task-specific multi-source domain adaptation via clustering embedded adversarial training.

Thanks to your review, we revised our paper to answer your concerns.\n1.\tThe paper misses some important multiple-source references.\n- We added additional reference to the related work section.\n\n2.\tThe proposed label-wise moment matching is not new in transfer.\n- The existing methods that have similar idea with ours have different focuses. Therefore, they should be distinguished from our approach.\n\n3.\tThe threshold tau is used to obtain the good target labels. On the one hand, it is unclear how this parameter should be set for different transfer tasks. On the other hand, high confidence score does not imply correct target label prediction. Error reinforcement may happen even with a well-tuned tau.\n- High confidence does not guarantee correct target label prediction but we think that there is a strong correlation between confidence and correctness.\n\n4.\tThe usage of ensemble feature extractor is actually using high complexity to enhance prediction accuracy. The scalability could be an issue of the proposed method, especially considering that multiple source may have large data size.\n- Even without ensemble, our method still shows the superiority. Thus, we believe that the model without ensemble learning can be used if there are resource constraint issues.\n\n5.\tSensitivity analysis on the balancing parameters alpha and beta should be done.\n- Because of the time limitation, we could not conduct the sensitivity analysis thoroughly. However, we observed that reducing alpha to 0.0001 in Multi-EPL (n=2) brings great performance degradation: from 83.95 to 78.16 with MNIST-M as the target domain.\n\n6.\tWhy data augmentation is done on office-caltech10 datasets? There are many datasets containing multiple domains with sufficient data. Please use these datasets instead of constructing artificial real-world dataset.\n- OFFICE-Caltech10 is one of the mostly used datasets for MSDA thanks to its domain diversity and imbalance (the number of data differs greatly depending on the domain). Data augmentation cannot be stated as the pitfall of OFFICE-Caltech dataset since the number of the data per label is the same as OFFICE31 or OFFICE-Home dataset.\n\n7.\tMore analyses on the performance difference of different tasks should be discussed.\n- For OFFICE-Caltech10 dataset, the state-of-the-art performance is already very high.

In order to examine the effectiveness of label-wise moment matching, you should compare Multi-0 and Multi-PL.\n\n3.\tThe empirical results, especially the ablation studies, do not hold.

In Eq.1, the authors minimize the discrepancy between every two distinct domains. It is unclear to me why not minimize the pairs of each source domain and target domain (N-pairs). The goal is to align the distributions between the source and target. Please clarify the motivation of aligning two source domains. Besides, it would be good to have one baseline only considering label-wise moment matching losses for only between N source and 1 target pairs.\n- Aligning two source domains allows the feature extractor to be more generalized by providing more guidance to be trained. Moreover, as we align features in a label-wise manner while exploiting pseudo-labels for the target data that are not guaranteed to be correct, aligning two source domains resolves the bad adaptation attributed to the wrongly labeled target data.\n\n2.\tIn page 5, the motivation of diversifying features form different extractors is unclear to me. Please clarify the benefit of classifying feature according to extractor ID labels. Moreover, the ablation study presented in section 5.3, does not show a clear improvement by introducing the diversifying loss. I would encourage the authors to design another analytical experiment to show its effectiveness.\n- If the two features from the two extractors are the same, then ensemble will be meaningless. Thus, we thought that diversifying features from the two different feature extractors would increase the knowledge in the ensembled features. As you have stated, we fully agree that newly designed experiment is essential to prove its effectiveness regardless its motivation.\n\n3.\tThe performance improvement compared to the state of the arts is limited.

Since the proposed method utilizes n feature extractors, the model complexity in the proposed method should be n times larger than that in existing methods. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1094/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1094/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-EPL: Accurate Multi-source Domain Adaptation", "authorids": ["~Seongmin_Lee2", "jeon185@gmail.com", "~U_Kang1"], "authors": ["Seongmin Lee", "Hyunsik Jeon", "U Kang"], "keywords": ["Multi-Source Domain Adaptation", "Label-wise Moment Matching", "Pseudolabel", "Ensemble of Feature Representation"], "abstract": "Given multiple source datasets with labels, how can we train a target model with no labeled data?

While the results seem promising, the technical contribution is incremental and limited. Meanwhile, more empirical results are needed to validate the effectiveness of the framework. \n- Strengths:\n    - The paper is well written and easy to follow.\n    - The problem investigated in this paper, i.e., multi-source domain adaptation, is of significance.\n- Weaknesses:\n    - The technical contribution of this work is limited. Label-wise moment matching or adversarial training (e.g., [1]) has been a common practice in single-source domain adaptation. The authors simply applies this idea of multi-mode aware domain adaptation to multi-source domain adaptation. Moreover, comparing the first line, i.e., MULTI-0, in Table 2 with M3SDA in Table 1(a), we find that this label-wise moment-matching makes almost no contribution.\n    - The empirical results, especially the ablation studies, do not hold. Pseudo-labeling the unlabeled data in the target domain and using multiple feature extractors can also be easily used by M3SDA and DCTN. Expecting a definite performance boost, I expect the authors to provide such results. Moreover, pseudo-labeling and ensemble learning, however, are not novel; they are widely adopted techniques and can be easily incorporated into any algorithm, e.g., M3SDA, for performance improvement. \n    - Even on the dataset Office-Caltech and Amazon Reviews, the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm is minor. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n[1] Pei, Z., Cao, Z., Long, M., & Wang, J.
