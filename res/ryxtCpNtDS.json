We would appreciate and welcome any suggestions. \n\n\u2028I took a look at both papers you linked, and while I agree that the use of GANs to generate synthetic data is not new, I believe that our model architecture does differ from existing GAN synthetic data generation techniques. Our model allows for the generation of synthetic labels and data for imbalanced sequence-to-sequence tasks, which we believe other synthetic data generation methods do not consider. Thank you for pointing out our lack of clarity about our model architecture, we will make revisions to the paper in order to provide more details. \n\nI believe we were not clear about how we evaluated our proposed methods for synthetic data generation. For each dataset, with or without synthetic data, we trained the same classification model in order to evaluate the impact of the synthetic data. The sequence-to-sequence model we consider as our classification model is implemented with a weighted cost function in order to more heavily penalize minority class misclassification. For each dataset, we ensemble the data and include all the minority data and a subset of the majority data in each ensemble. For the baseline comparison, we consider a model trained without synthetic dataset. Hopefully this helps clarify any confusion you might have about our classification model and how we evaluated our methods. \n\nLastly, thank you for pointing out our formatting errors and for giving us a ways to improve the clarity of our figures and tables. We will address these concerns in a forthcoming revision.

However, training the GAN model to generate synthetic data is computationally expensive and requires some experimentation with hyperparameters, so we will unfortunately not be able to provide additional results. \n\nAs the model we are proposing is a method for generating synthetic minority training data, as a first pass, it seems reasonable to compare the model trained with the augmented dataset against a model without any synthetic data. You raise a good point about using SMOTE and related methods directly on the data. We consider a method where we apply ADASYN to the Autoencoder embedding, but we have not considered applying these methods directly to the flattened input. We will run a model trained on an dataset augmented SMOTE generated synthetic data and revise the paper. \n\nWhile the \u201cModel-Based Oversampling for Imbalanced Sequence Classification\u201d paper projects data into 2D space for visualization using PCA, we project the synthetic and original data for only the IMDB dataset into 2D space using TSNE.

Experiments are not convincing, as the authors don't compare to the state of the art approaches. As the exact problem statement is hard to grasp, it is hard to identify the exact contribution of authors.\nNote, that the proposed approaches, in my opinion, are not that different from approaches from modern data generation for imbalanced classification [1, 2], as we propose some kind of GAN to generate new data and so have only two variables: how we select loss for this GAN and how we select the architecture.\n\nI assume, that to be accepted at a major venue a deeper investigation is required at the moment.\n\nSee also the following comments:\n1. Figure 4: title is not required, as we have a caption with the same information. Better to use confidence bars too.\n2. The figures will benefit from usage of vector format.\n3. Figure 3: tSNE can vary from one run to another. It is better to provide at least 3 random figures or even better train e.g. a simple classification model for t-SNE embedded model and present ROC AUC scores for identification synthetic/non-synthetic.\n4. Table 1&2 formatting is different from that usually used in Academy (see e.g. https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/files/publications/style/chapter-05.pdf)\n5. F1 score is often not the best metric for imbalanced problems. The paper will benefit from providing also PR AUC (average precision) scores.\n6. Figure 2: avoid confusion matrices presented in this form, as they take much space providing almost no information. Classic tables are better.\n7. From the problem statement at the very beginning of section 2 it is not clear what kind of labels do we expect (I suppose that for each sequence we have a specific label i.e. all y_i are 0 but one, that is 1)\n8. Sometimes bigger weights for minority objects or dropping significant part of majority sequences are enough, so results for these approaches also should be included\n9.
