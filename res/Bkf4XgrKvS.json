Please carefully explain this point.\n- In the proposed method, coarse nodes should be selected beforehand. Is there any guideline of how to choose them?\n- In Section 3.2, optimal transport is introduced and the distance between G and G_C is measured via entropic optimal transport in Equation (4) or (7).\n    However, in Equation (4), a and b should come from the input G and G_C , and it is not clearly explained how to obtain them from the input.\n    Moreover, how to use the distance between G and G_C in the proposed coarsening method is also not clear. It seems that it is not used in Algorithm 1.\n- I do not understand why the k-step optimal transport distance is needed. Since it converges to the global optimum as k becomes large, it is usually enough to set k to be large enough.\n- In experiments, how is the proposed method used for graph classification?\n    Since the proposed method is for generating coarse graphs in an unsupervised manner, graph classification cannot be directly performed by itself.\n- In addition to the above issue, to assess the effectiveness of the the proposed method, the following experiment is recommended:\n    Fix some classifier and compare performance of graph classification for the original graphs and for the coarse graphs.\n- In the qualitative study in Section 4.4, while the authors discuss coarse nodes, they are just an input from the user and results are arbitrary. Hence such discussion is not informative.\n\nMinor comments:\n- What is \"X\" in Equation (2)?\n- I recommend to write domain for matrices when they used at the first time.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.

They are good questions. Let us respond from two angles.\n\nWe choose to use optimal transport in a large part because it gives a convenient measure of the difference of two graphs. Recent work cited by the paper, such as Vayer et al. (2019), Xu et al., (2019a), and Garg & Jaakkola (2019), all devotes to the development of this measure. Natural alternatives may be to leverage graph embedding vectors and use the vector Euclidean distance as the measure, but we find that leveraging the node embedding vectors and treating them as a distribution in the optimal transport way is a more powerful machinery. Of course, one may summarize node embedding vectors into a graph embedding vector, but the summarization may lose information.\n\nThe optimal transport plan P is obtained as a byproduct of the computation of the optimal transport distance. Conceptually, the plan may be interpreted as how much portion of what nodes are transported to a coarse node. On the other hand, the coarsening matrix S plays more a role of determining the edge weights of the coarse graph (because A_c = S\u2019AS). The matrices P and S are not necessarily the same, not even the sparsity structure. We have thought of using P to replace S, but this is a chicken-and-egg problem, because parameterization cannot be done. Another challenge is that when one looks at P and S, one implicitly assumes that the coarse nodes are known. However, the selection of coarse nodes comes from the coarsening step but not the transportation step. One must resolve these technical challenges before being able to equate P with S.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.

In what follows we respond to them. We also have updated the paper accordingly.\n\nRE: Structure of the paper.\n\nWe concur to your dissection of the work regarding the coarsening matrix and the Wasserstein metric. Indeed, we are not transferring results from AMG; but rather, we use it as an intuition of the design of the coarsening procedure A_c = S\u2019AS. To put this component in context, we note that the design of coarsening (or \u201cpooling\u201d, used interchangeably) is a focus in the GNN literature recently. With flourishing proposals of the pooling operator, we do find that our proposal offers an opportunity to obtain meaningful coarse graphs, as demonstrated by the examples in Figure 3. We hope such a contribution will not be eclipsed by the use of Wasserstein metric to learn the coarsening matrix S.\n\nRE: Empirical results.\n\nThe information regarding the amount of downsampling is presented in Appendix D, \u201cExperimentation Details.\u201d Specifically, the coarsening ratio is set to 0.5 for all methods, which means that every time the node count of the graph is halved. The number of levels, on the other hand, is treated a tunable hyperparameter. In most cases two levels lead to good results. In summary, the amount of compression is quite comparable.\n\nThe number of parameters is also comparable for different hierarchical methods, since it is dominated by the GCN parameters. It, however, is roughly proportional to the number of coarsening levels, which, as mentioned, is a hyperparameter and is often set to two after tuning.\n\nWe also updated the paper with baseline performance by ablating the coarsening. To make unsupervised training possible, in this case we use a graph autoencoder to obtain node representations and then pool them to form the graph representation. (The autocoder applies GCN twice, one to encode node features into the needed representations and the other to decode them and reconstruct the original node features.) The results are presented in the last but one row of Table 1. Overall, the baseline results are inferior to the proposed hierarchical method, but still are quite good in context. For more information, please see Sections 4.1 and 4.2.\n\nRE: The point of unsupervised learning.\n\nThe major reason for conducting unsupervised learning is that in practice, labels are scarce and expensive to obtain. We are fortunate to have quite a few annotated data sets as benchmarks that facilitate evaluation. In real-life applications, however, often what limits the choice of methods is not the data but the labels (a folklore wisdom is that data is abundant in this \u201cbig data\u201d era but labels are expensive to obtain).\n\nAdditionally, we demonstrate the possibility of learning graph hierarchical structures without using labels.\n\nWe concur that multitask learning is an excellent example demonstrating the use of a single representation for different downstream tasks. We have included an experiment and updated the paper; see Section 4.4.\n\nWe also inserted the justification of unsupervised learning in the abstract.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.

The critique is largely concerned with WL. We respond to it from two angles and have updated the paper to incorporate these discussions.\n\nRE: GNN versus graph kernels.\n\nWe well agree that there is a strong connection between WL kernels and various GNNs that fall under the \u201cmessage passing\u201d umbrella. And by no means we attempt to claim which one outperforms the other. From past empirical evidence, it is fair to say that results are often data set dependent (not to mention the overwhelming hyperparameter tuning cost). We would like to be open minded and not jump into hasty conclusions, in light of the current active development of GNNs, as well as efforts of identifying their expressive power.\n\nOn the other hand, we would also like to stress that exploiting hierarchical structures, a focus of this paper, is an orthogonal effort to the WL connection. In fact, it would be an interesting topic to investigate whether one can inject coarsening into the WL test, as an attempt to improve computational efficiency in (approximate) graph isomorphism tests.\n\nWe thank you for bringing up this issue. We have cited the mentioned paper, as well as related ones, and included a short discussion in the first paragraph of the introduction section.\n\nRE: Novelty.\n\nWe would like to clarify that the coarsening approach we are proposing has a very weak connection with WL. The connection may be argued from the fact that we use GCN as one of the components in the parameterization of the coarsening matrix. However, the parameterization is only one piece of the method. The novelty and contribution of the work lie in the hierarchical treatment and the use of graph distance for parameter learning. The WL tests do not generate coarse graphs. The WL kernels also generally do not have a hierarchical flavor. Moreover, the counterpart of \u201cgraph distance\u201d in the WL setting is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is in contrast to optimal transport in our case. Hence, we debate that the proposed differentiable pooling does not \u201cuse WL kind of ideas\u201d in a large part.\n\nTo clarify the novelty and contribution, we have added a summary from the perspectives of unsupervised learning, coarsening strategy, and empirical results, at the end of the introduction section.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.

In what follows we answer them one by one and hope the replies help you reassess the value of our work. Please do not hesitate to ask more questions should they arise.\n\n- A_c indeed is generally not binary. We treat both A and A_c as *weighted* adjacency matrices. By the design of S, the nonzero elements of A_c are all positive and they qualify as edge weights.\n\n- Coarse nodes are not selected beforehand. Rather, they are selected through a parameterized ranking process (see eqn (2)). The parameters are obtained by optimizing a loss function.\n\n- a and b are empirical measures in the optimal transport setting. As we explain in the text below eqn (4), \u201ceach of a and b has constant elements that sum to unity, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe optimal transport distance is the loss function that we minimize. This is not to be confused with the fact that the distance itself is the result of a separate minimization problem. The k-step distance is like a closed-form formula solution of this separate minimization problem.\n\n- The use of k-step is to make it a deterministic differentiable function. One may set k however large one wants, but it must be a specific number. In practice, because of the chain rule of differentiation, making k very large incurs a computational burden.\n\n- Graph classification is performed through training a separate predictive model by taking the graph representation as input. As stated in the paper, \u201cFor each node embedding matrix, we perform a global pooling (e.g., a concatenation of max pooling and mean pooling) across the nodes and obtain a summary vector. We then concatenate the summary vectors for all coarsening levels to form the feature vector of the graph. A multilayer perceptron is then built to predict the graph label.\u201d\n\n- As indicated by the above item, we use the information of the original graph and all subsequent coarse graphs when performing graph classification. That is, we do not separate these two pieces of information.\n\n- As responded in an earlier item, the selection of the coarse nodes is learned rather than hand-picked. The purpose of Section 4.4 is to show that the learned result is meaningful qualitatively.\n\n- X in eqn (2) is the node feature matrix. Thank you for the note and we have patched the notation explanation.\n\n- Similarly, we have included the domains of the matrices.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.

This paper proposed a hierarchical unsupervised pooling operation.  In each pooling,  nodes are selected by keeping the top-k nodes after transforming the node feature to importance score with one-layer GCN to consider both node features and graph structures.  Then coarsening matrix $S$ are obtained by sampling and reweighing the normalized adjacent matrix. All the above strategy is existed. The main contribution of this paper is to adopt the optimal transport distance as unsupervised loss. In this paper, the optimal transportation distance are defined as $W_\\gamma(G,G_c)=min_{P\\in U(a,b)}<P,M>+\\lambdaE(P)$. In this function, $M$ is transport matrix and obtained by calculating the distance between the  transformed node features of original graph and coarsening graph, $P$ is joint probability measure related to $M$ and the optimal joint probability measure can be obtained as $P_\\lambda=diag(u)exp(-M/\\lambda)diag(v)$. Thus the optimal transport distance is finally obtained and used to guide the training. \nI have some concerns about the motivation. First,  why optimal transport distance is a good loss function to guide the selection of node and coarsening of graph, the insights behind are not fully discussed. Second, in final, we could obtain the transport cost matrix as well as the optimal joint probability measure. Does it mean that we can obtain the optimal transport plan to transport original graph to coarsening graph, what is the relationship between the optimal plan with the  coarsening matrix? this is not mentioned in this paper."}, "signatures": ["~Mingxing_Xu3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~Mingxing_Xu3", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.

Moreover, since you also employ graph convolutional networks for coarsening, you are also in the regime of this paper. Consequently, one should actually compare to WL, at least one should mention this connection. Actually, given that the datasets are not that large, one should run some statistical significance test. Moreover, if you check the paper above, they report much better results for PatchySan on MUTAG, better results on Protein for graph kernels, better results on IMDB-B using a hierarchical GNN approach, based on ideas of higher-order WL. \n\nNevertheless, indeed, the present paper shows that a differentiable pooling using WL kind of ideas is competitive to existing pooling approach. This is nice, but in the light of the work above, the novelty is unclear. This has to be clarified before publication.

The proposed architecture is constructed by unrolling k-steps of a parametrized algebraic multigrid approach for minimizing the Wasserstein metric between the graph and its representation. The node distance (transport cost) used in the Wasserstein metric is also learned as an L2 distance between the embeddings of some graph embedding function. The approach is compared against 6 other state of the art approaches on 5 graph classification tasks, showing significant improvements 4 of them.\n\nThe paper is reasonably well written, however, I think some of the explanations can be tightened further. Especially a lot on the background of AMG is not really that relevant, since the authors are not transferring technical results from AMG. Also, it seems like a better flow for presenting this argument might be to switch the order of sections 3.2.1 and 3.1.2. It looks like the main point is  that this architecture is trying to emulate iterative coarsened residual optimization of the Wasserstein metric between a graph and its representation. How the coarsening matrix is derived is more of a technical point (it looks like the results would be much more sensitive to a switch of metric than to a switch of parametrization for S). \n\nThe empirical results are quite intriguing. There are, however, natural and important questions left unanswered. First and foremost, how does the amount of downsampling (compression) compare between methods. How many parameters do different methods require? It would also be good to see what the baseline performance would have been without any input compression as to understand how close these approaches are to the upper bound.\n\nFinally, I think the main issue of this paper, is left unresolved, namely, what is the point of not having supervision from the downstream task. As a user of graph representations trying to solve some problem, the only thing I would want from my representation is to capture some notion of sufficient statistics that are small enough to be efficient and allow me to solve my problem. I would not necessarily care about how well the learned representation resembles the original graph unless I believed that my downstream task was hard to evaluate  and that it was very smooth in the Wasserstein metric. I read the paper multiple times, trying to find any discussion on this, but it seems that the fact that an unsupervised representation is a good thing is taken for granted. A point could at least be made using the same representation for different tasks experimentally. Or, perhaps, literally doing an AMG-type unpacking of the downstream task itself as a comparison. This would shed light on the question of whether the iterated residuals or the choice of distance is what's driving the observed results."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2208/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tengfei.ma1@ibm.com", "chenjie@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Unsupervised Learning of Graph Hierarchical Abstractions with Differentiable Coarsening and Optimal Transport", "authors": ["Tengfei Ma", "Jie Chen"], "pdf": "/pdf/480a1e2a2459842b0b1b1a67109715498481b832.pdf", "abstract": "Hierarchical abstractions are a methodology for solving large-scale graph problems in various disciplines.
