Specifically, this paper proves that a discriminator which is robust to adversarial attacks also leads to a robust minimax objects. Authors provide theoretical analysis about the how the robustness of the Discriminator affects the properties of the objective function, and the proposed regularization term provides an efficient and effective way to regularize the discriminator to be robust. However, it does not build connection between the robustness of the Discriminator and why it can provide meaningful gradient to the Generator. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This paper is easy to understand.\n\n\n## Drawbacks\nThere are some problems in this paper. First, this paper is not highly motivated and lacks of intuition. I can hardly understand why the robustness can stabilize the training of GAN. Will it solve the problem of gradient vanishing problem or speed up the convergence of GAN? The toy example in Sec. 4.2 shows that it can regularize the Discriminator to provide a meaningful gradient to Generator, but no theoretical analysis is provided. The main gap between them is that the smoothness of D around the generated data points does not imply the effectiveness of gradients. Second, the theoretical analysis is inconsistent with the experimental settings. Theorem 4.3 holds true when f is non-positive, but WGAN\u2019s loss function can be positive and this paper does not give any details about this part. Third, in Sec. 4.2, I can hardly distinguish the difference between robust loss, robust discriminator and regularized objectives.\n\nBesides, there are lots of typos in this paper. In Sec 3, Generative Adversarial Networks part, the notations of x and z are quiet confusing. In Definition 3.2, d which measures the distance between network outputs is not appeared above.\n\n## Summarization\nGenerally, this paper provides a novel way to stabilize the training of GAN. However, it does not illustrate its motivation clearly and no insight is provided.\n\n## After rebuttal\nSome of the issues are addressed. So I change my rating to 6.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1403/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Don't let your Discriminator  be fooled", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the leading tools in generative modeling, image editing and content creation. \nHowever, they are hard to train as they require a delicate balancing act between two deep networks fighting a never ending duel.

We are glad that the reviewer sees our contribution as a novel idea. We address the main concerns below.\n\n> this paper is not highly motivated and lacks (of) intuition. I can hardly understand why the robustness can stabilize the training of GAN.\n\nAs the reviewer rightly pointed out the connection between smoothness of the objective and ease (or stability) of training is an empirical one.\n\u201cThe toy example in Sec. 4.2 shows that it can regularize the Discriminator to provide a meaningful gradient to Generator, but no theoretical analysis is provided\u201d\nWe are not the first paper to establish this empirical connection, WGAN and follow-up work already established this on a wide range of generative tasks. However, we are the first to point out that this smoothness / robustness is not a property of WGAN, but rather the regularization used to optimize the discriminator in any GAN.\n\nIn addition, we show empirically in Table 2 that robustness leads to much more stable training (and better generation performance) than theoretically motivated stability results such as Instance Noise. However, the reviewer is right that there is no theoretical connection, which is an important avenue of future work, but beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n\n> the theoretical analysis is inconsistent with the experimental settings. Theorem 4.3 holds true when f is non-positive, but WGAN\u2019s loss function can be positive and this paper does not give any details about this part.\n\nThe reviewer is right that Theorem 4.3 only applies to the JS (GAN) and LS (LSGAN) objectives for which the regularization works best. Theorem 4.3 does not say anything about linear (WGAN) objectives. For WGAN style objectives the original WGAN paper showed robustness results under slightly different conditions. We tried to extend our results to linear objectives, but did not yet succeed (we could not proof or disproof Theorem 4.3 for linear objectives).\nWe still included WGAN results in the results to establish the empirical connection between regularization and robustness. While we can not prove robustness for linear objectives, it still holds in practice.\nHowever, if the reviewer finds this distracting and confusing we are happy to edit or remove parts of the experimental section to make it more consistent.\n\n> in Sec. 4.2, I can hardly distinguish the difference between robust loss, robust discriminator and regularized objectives.\n\nBoth robust loss and discriminator pose a hard constraint on the discriminator (either before or after the loss function). These hard constraints are difficult to optimize (see WGAN), but easy to analyze. The regularized objective is easy to optimize as a regularization (soft constraint) between two generative distributions (original and perturbed). Theorem 4.3 shows that the regularized objective can be reduced to hard constraints for the JS and LS objectives, and thus benefits for all the analysis of the hard constraints.\n\nWe will update the paper to better highlight this difference.\n\n> Typos and notation\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing the typos and notational inconsistencies out, and will fix them in the next iteration.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1403/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1403/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1403/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Don't let your Discriminator  be fooled", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the leading tools in generative modeling, image editing and content creation. \nHowever, they are hard to train as they require a delicate balancing act between two deep networks fighting a never ending duel.
