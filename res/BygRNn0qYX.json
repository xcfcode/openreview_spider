The paper is well-written and the discussion is quite easy to follow along. The paper also introduces some interesting concepts like a partial permutation invariant set function. However, I find that some of the paper's main claims can be further backed up by more experiments.\n\nThe paper is well-written. The authors evaluate their approach on a large number of real-world homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Furthermore, they show the stability of their method by showing consistently good results even when training set size is varied. Defined the notion of a partial permutation invariant set function and provided theoretical guarantees pertaining to this.\n\nOne of the strengths of the proposed method is its ability to \"automatically decide the significance of nodes at different distances.\" The authors devote a good portion of their paper to talk about this. However, a recent paper published in NIPS '18 [1] with a pre-print available much earlier solves this problem by applying attention over powers of a transition matrix. The authors should talk about [1] and ideally compare against them.\n\nI feel that a lot of the authors main claims can be strengthened further if more experiments were shown to back these up. What I mean to say is, it would be nice to see some other experiments apart from just classification performance. To compare with [1], for instance, they show link prediction/classification results but on top of these they also show that their method may choose very different \"neighborhoods\" to attend to.\n\nThe authors gave a fairly comprehensive review of related literature (which was good!) and they mentioned that \"most existing methods either explicitly or implicitly restrict the dependence form of each node to its neighbors and also the depth of neighbors.\" I feel another approach they should compare against which does not seem to have this problem is [2] since the method learns \"role-based\" embeddings which are more dependent on structure rather than proximity.\n\nThe paper in its current form is fairly good. If comparison can be made against [1] & [2] and some additional experiments can be added, the quality of the paper can be improved further.\n[1] Watch Your Step: Learning Node Embeddings via Graph Attention.
