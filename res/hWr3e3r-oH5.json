We are also thankful for the constructive suggestions that helped us improve our paper.\n1.\t**Need and intended effect of multi-stage cross-attention**: As suggested, we tried several hyper-parameter settings in 1-stage model but could not outperform 2-stage model even with more parameters. This is shown in Table 8 in the Appendix-A, where we vary the dimensions of the cross-correlation matrix $W$ and report results for the AVE dataset. Instead of increasing the parameters in 1-stage model itself, when an additional stage is added (i.e. a weight matrix learned with a non-linear activation function) better performance is achieved. Indeed, it is often not trivial to replace a sequence of non-linear functions with another non-linear function as we experimentally observe here. We had only reported in Section 4.2 but now we also mention in the caption of Fig. 1 that non-linear activation is used in each stage. The intention is also to extensively delve into cross-modal information, progressively learning the embeddings for each modality. \n2.\t**Revision of related work**: We have modified the Section 2 in the paper according to the suggestion. We start with an introductory sentence and add how our work is different from the related works in each paragraph (mostly at the end). Also, a few more related papers are added for better comparison and completeness.\n3.\t**AVE vs ActivityNet1.2**: Yes, the reference is to the ActivityNet1.2 dataset, which contains \u201cwider range of actions\u201d compared to the AVE dataset. The difference is not in the labels but in the kind of videos and action classes. In AVE, the action classes are limited to those with strong audio cues in small videos (10-second), where each video includes only one action instance; here leveraging audio is easier. Whereas, in ActivityNet1.2, wider variety of action classes are present in longer videos (few minutes) with multiple action instances per video and often with weak audio cues, which makes action localization and leveraging audio harder. We revised Section 4.1 to better clarify this while describing ActivityNet1.2 dataset.\n4.\t**Sentence formation/language**: We fixed the text in Section 3.2 as \u201c\u2026 are fed snippet-wise into the \u2026\u201d and modified the caption of Figure 2 as well."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2362/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2362/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-Attentional Audio-Visual Fusion for Weakly-Supervised Action Localization", "authorids": ["~Jun-Tae_Lee1", "~Mihir_Jain1", "hwoopark@qti.qualcomm.com", "sungrack@qti.qualcomm.com"], "authors": ["Jun-Tae Lee", "Mihir Jain", "Hyoungwoo Park", "Sungrack Yun"], "keywords": ["Audio-Visual", "Multimodal Attention", "Action localization", "Event localization", "Weak-supervision"], "abstract": "Temporally localizing actions in videos is one of the key components for video understanding.

We are also thankful for the constructive suggestions that helped us improve our paper.\n\n1.\t**Performance drop in 3-stage model**: Indeed, the performance drop with 3-stage model is counter intuitive. To analyze this, in Table 7 (Appendix-A), we compare 2- and 3-stage models on each of \u2018w/o skip connection', \u2018w/ skip connection', and \u2018w/ dense skip connection'. Without the skip connection, 3-stage model improves over 2-stage model, which is intuitively expected. With the skip connection, avg. mAP of 3-stage model drops compared to 2-stage model, from 24.9% to 23.2%. But, when the third stage is appended to the trained (and now frozen) stages of 2-stage model, the avg. mAP is maintained at 24.9%. Similarly, with the dense skip connection, end-to-end training of 3-stage model leads to degraded performance. But, when training the model frozen till the second stage, the performance drop is much less. The fact that, in 3-stage model, better performance is obtained when training with first two stages frozen compared to training end-to-end, shows that the optimization gets hard in the latter. Therefore, we conclude that though the third stage helps without skip connections, due to harder optimization with more stages and (dense) skip connection, 2-stage model is the optimal choice here.\n2.\t**Clarity on Section 4.3 and Table 2**: Yes, in Table 2, the results are for 2-stage models. We make this clear in the caption of Table 2, and clearly define the O-I, O-II, and O-III in Section 4.3 before their use.\n3.\t**Effect of the continuity losses on different stage models**: We have conducted the ablation analysis on the consistency losses for 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-stage models in Table 9 (Appendix-B). The impact of the continuity losses is analogous on 1-, 2- and 3-stage models. Each of the two continuity losses are useful, but the pseudo localization loss is more effective. Also, there is further benefit of using them together for almost all the IoU thresholds and stages. In 0-stage model, i.e. without the cross-attention, O-II shows the highest snippet-level performance on the AVE dataset, but the lowest temporal action localization performance on the ActivityNet1.2 dataset. From this, we understand that the pseudo localization loss has difficulty in achieving continuity when audio and visual features are overly heterogeneous. That is why, we observe clear benefit when cross-attention is used. Doing this suggested analysis, we also observed the interdependence of the cross-attention and the pseudo localization loss, and explain this in the Appendix-B.\n4.\t**Computation increase by adding audio (model efficiency)**: Indeed, as noted by the reviewer, the computation cost is increased by adding audio. We added a sub-section 4.4 on the model efficiency. We report the increase in computation and also suggest an efficient version of our method. This version maintains performance (25.9% vs 26%) while considerably reducing the computation cost from 4 MFLOPS to 1.7 MFLOPS, that is less than that of the default visual-only model (2.3 MFLOPS).

The three added references use cross-attention for few-shot learning (Hou et. al. 2019) and image-text matching (Lei et al 2018, Wei et al 2020). The most similar to our cross-attention mechanism is the cross-attention module of Hou et. al. 2019, which computes cross-correlation spatially between features maps of two images. Whereas our cross-attention is designed for video and is computed between two temporal sequences of different modalities.\n- **Assessment of the contributions of the proposed cross-attention**: Since the previous cross-attention methods are not designed to correlate the temporal sequences, we could not experimentally compare ours with them. However, we do compare with Tian et al. (in Tables 5 and 6) and Xuan et al. (in Table 5), both of them employ one-way audio-guided visual attention. Better performance of our method indicates the contribution of our cross-attention. We further experimentally validate the benefit of our cross-attention in Tables 1 and 6 in the main paper, and Table 9 in the Appendix. We revised 2nd paragraph of Section 2 to describe how our cross-attention differs from the only relevant two-way attention method of Wu et. al.: \u201cAssuming single event videos, they detect the event-related snippet by matching the video-level feature of one modality with the snippet-level feature sequence of the other modality. Contrastingly, our cross-attention is over the temporal sequences from both the modalities and does not assume single-action videos\u201d. They do not report weakly supervised results on AVE dataset, so experimental comparison couldn\u2019t be done, also the single video assumption makes their approach inapt for ActivityNet1.2 dataset. \n- **The novelty of our cross-attention layer**, therefore, comes from: (a) the first such method that computes cross-attention over temporal sequences of different modalities, and (b) the first audio-visual fusion method for action localization in long videos. Please see the revised 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of Section 2, and Tables 1, 5, 6 and 9 for more details and comparisons.\n\n2.\t**Choice of backbone**: \n- **Fair comparison**: We choose the backbone for fair comparison with the competing methods. In Table 5, for AVE dataset, all the competing methods use ResNet-152 as backbone. In Table 6, for ActivityNet1.2, we used I3D model for extracting visual features as majority of competing methods do the same. We used the same audio feature extractor as used for AVE dataset. So, improvement over SOTA is due to the proposed method.\n- **How much initial embeddings are responsible for the results**: In Table 5, the \u2018na\u00efve fusion\u2019 method also uses the proposed continuity losses to achieve avg. mAP of 22.9%, still relatively about 12% lower than our final avg. mAP of 26%. We added results for another na\u00efve fusion which does not use the proposed losses, avg. mAP drops to 19.8%.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2362/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2362/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Cross-Attentional Audio-Visual Fusion for Weakly-Supervised Action Localization", "authorids": ["~Jun-Tae_Lee1", "~Mihir_Jain1", "hwoopark@qti.qualcomm.com", "sungrack@qti.qualcomm.com"], "authors": ["Jun-Tae Lee", "Mihir Jain", "Hyoungwoo Park", "Sungrack Yun"], "keywords": ["Audio-Visual", "Multimodal Attention", "Action localization", "Event localization", "Weak-supervision"], "abstract": "Temporally localizing actions in videos is one of the key components for video understanding.

They introduce a multi-stage cross attention approach to fuse audio-visual features and a consistency loss to enforce temporal continuity.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe approach is well motivated and the technical contribution is clear.  The paper is well written and the contributions are evaluated against a number of recent SOTA approaches on two datasets for action localization.\n\nWeaknesses/Concerns\n\nI would like to see a discussion on the drop in performance in the 3-stage model compared to the 2-stage and 1-stage models in Table 1.  This drop is not intuitive so the authors should provide some analysis here.\n\nIn section 4.3 and Table 2, it seems O-I, O-II and O-III are used before being defined.  Are these results with the 2-stage model?  I would like to see the effect of using the different stage models with the different versions of the loss function.  This will help understand the different contributions to the final performance.\n\nThe model introduces increased computation and additional parameters.  What is the increase in computation?  This could be important for detection systems that prioritize a trade-off of performance and efficiency.\n\nRecommendation and reasoning\n\nThis is a good paper that could be improved with some additional experiments/analysis and improved clarity.
