The approach of the paper is well motivated intuitively, but could more explicitly show that PCMC-Net is needed to fix inferential problems with PCMC and that e.g. SGD and some regularization + the linear parameterization suggested by the original PCMC authors isn't scalable in itself. \n3. The approximation theorem is useful and clean, and the empirical results are intriguing. While consideration of more datasets would improve the results, the metrics and baselines considered demonstrate a considerable empirical case for this method. \n\nMy \"weak accept\" decision is closer to \"accept\" than \"weak reject.\" (Edit 11/25/19: I raised my score in to accept in conjunction with the author's improvements in the open discussion phase)\n\nImprovement areas(all relatively minor):\n- While I personally enjoy the choice axioms focused on by the PCMC model and this paper, stochastic transitivity, IIA, and regularity are probably more important to emphasize than Contractibility. Because the properties of UE and contractibility were not used, it may be more appropriate to use this space to introduce more of the literature on neural-nets-as-feature-embeddings stuff. \n- This paper could be improved by generalizing to a few other choice models- in particular the CDM (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03266) may be a good candidate for your method. This is more a suggestion for future work if you expand this promising initial result. \n- Hyper-parameter tuning: I noticed that several of your hyper parameters were set to extremal values for the ranges you considered. If you tuned the other algorithms' hyper parameters the same way, it could be the case that the relative performance is explained by the appropriateness of those ranges. Would be interesting to have a more in-depth treatment of this, but I do understand that it's a lot of work. \n\n\nSpecific Notes:\nTheorem 1 is nice, and the proof is clean, but doesn't explicitly note that a PCMC model jointly specifies a family of distributions \\pi_S for each S \\in 2^U obtained by subsetting a single rate matrix Q indexed by U. It's clear that PCMC-Net will still approximate under this definition, as \\hat q_ij  approximates each q_ij because \\hat q_ij doesn't depend on S. While the more explicit statement is true with the same logic in the theorem, the notational choice to have \"X_i\" represent the \"i-th\" element in S is confusing at first, as e.g. X_1 is a different feature vector for S = {2,3} and S={1,3}. I don't see this issue as disqualifying, but it took me a while to realize that there wasn't more than a notational abuse problem when I returned to the definitions where the indexing depended on the set S under consideration. \n\n\nTypos/small concerns:\n-Above equation (1), the number of parameters in Q_S is |S|(|S|-1) rather than (|S|-1)^2, as each of the |S| alternatives has a transition rate to the other |S|-1 alternatives. \n-Below equation (3), I think you mean j \\in S rather than 1<= j <= |S|, as S may not be {1,2,...,|S|}. Later I noticed that you always index S with {1,\\dots,|S|}, but using i \\in S in combination with 1<=j<=|S| was a bit confusing. \n-X_i as the i-th element of S is a bit of an abuse of notation, as it surpasses dependence on S\n-In Figure 1, you show X_0 in a vector that is referred to as \"S.\" It is my understanding that X_0 represents user features. As the user is not in the set, this is confusing. The use of a vertical ellipsis to connect \\rho(X_0) to \\rho(X_1) is also confusion, as \\rho(X_1) is input into the Cartesian product while X_0 is input into the direct sum. \n\nOverall, nice job! Really enjoyed the paper and approach, good to see connections made between these literatures so that progress in discrete choice can be used at scale. \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["alherit@gmail.com"], "title": "PCMC-Net: Feature-based Pairwise Choice Markov Chains", "authors": ["Alix Lh\u00e9ritier"], "pdf": "/pdf/c156e921437557833ce502262c1c9455daf0b48c.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a generic neural network architecture equipping Pairwise Choice Markov Chains choice models with amortized and automatic differentiation based inference using alternatives' and individuals' features.", "abstract": "Pairwise Choice Markov Chains (PCMC) have been recently introduced to overcome limitations of choice models based on traditional axioms unable to express empirical observations from modern behavior economics like context effects occurring when a choice between two options is altered by adding a third alternative.

The method relies on training a neural network. Consequently, the authors claim that inference is amortized, but its computational complexity is still quadratic in the number of choice alternatives due to separate processing of all pairs of alternatives. PCMC-Net bakes the definition of PCMC into the neural net structure and therefore satisfies the theoretical properties of contractability and uniform expansion, which are desired properties of choice models\nMoreover, since choice probabilities are a function of choice candidates\u2019 features (and features of an individual making the choice), this method allows for new (unseen) choice candidates at test time, which was not possible with previously proposed maximum-likelihood (ML) inference. The approach is evaluated on modelling the choice of airline itinerary, on which it outperforms all considered baselines by a significant margin.\n\nI recommend REJECTing this paper. This paper tackles the problem of efficient inference and test-time generalization (to unseen choice alternatives) for choice modelling, and the proposed approach is interesting, seems to be theoretically sound, and outperforms evaluated baselines. Experimental evaluation is insufficient, however, with the method assessed only on a single dataset---in which case it is unclear if the method is better than baselines in general, or whether it is a quirk of the considered dataset. Moreover, the authors do not compare to ML inference in PCMC, which seems to be the closest possible baseline; instead, the authors only mention that ML would overfit on this dataset. Finally, the paper is full of complicated terms and cumbersome notation, which makes it difficult to read. Technical terms are often used without definition (e.g. framing effects, Luce\u2019s axiom, asymmetric dominance), which makes the paper inaccessible to an inexperienced reader like myself.\n\nI think that this work could be improved in the following ways. The exposition should be made simpler and easier to follow (especially section 2), and all technical terms should be appropriately defined. Additionally, the method should be evaluated on at least one more dataset and compared to ML inference for PCMC.

We added a sentence in the introduction to explicitly define it.\n\t\u2022 The triangle notation is defined in the sentence where it is used first.\n\t\u2022 The original inference approach counts the choices observed for each choice set (see Eq. 4).  Additive smooting adds a pseudo-count (e.g. \\alpha=0.1) to each counter to avoid numerical instabilities when doing the MLE optimization. The remark was taken from the original paper and refers to performance. The epsilon used in our work is used to enforce the constraint that defines PCMC, ensuring the existence and unicity of the stationary distribution and has no effect on performance.\n\t\u2022 Contractibility guarantees that the model behaves well when alternatives can be partitioned into classes of equivalence. This has practical modeling importance when equivalent alternatives are present in the choice set like in the classical Red Bus/Blue Bus example where the color of the bus is irrelevant to the preference of transportation mode \"bus\" with respect to the \"car\" mode. For example, MNL models reduce the probability of choosing the car mode when multiple color variants of buses are added, which does not match empirical behavior.  This example is added in Section 2.\n\t\u2022 In the new experiment, we compared against a simple parameterization of Q obtained by the discretizing the features.\n\t\u2022 We moved Table 1 to appendix\n\t\u2022 The new experiment considers a small synthetic dataset where present effects are known in order to gain intuition.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["alherit@gmail.com"], "title": "PCMC-Net: Feature-based Pairwise Choice Markov Chains", "authors": ["Alix Lh\u00e9ritier"], "pdf": "/pdf/c156e921437557833ce502262c1c9455daf0b48c.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a generic neural network architecture equipping Pairwise Choice Markov Chains choice models with amortized and automatic differentiation based inference using alternatives' and individuals' features.", "abstract": "Pairwise Choice Markov Chains (PCMC) have been recently introduced to overcome limitations of choice models based on traditional axioms unable to express empirical observations from modern behavior economics like context effects occurring when a choice between two options is altered by adding a third alternative.

Previous approaches to fitting PCMCs have leveraged sequential least squares programming, making optimization unstable, the model prone to overfitting, and test-time inference difficult.  The authors propose parametrizing PCMCs with neural networks to fix these issues.  Relying on universal function approximation results, the authors show that their PCMC-Net can represent arbitrary transition matrices.  The experiments report results on a dataset of airline booking behavior, comparing PCMC-Net with four other baselines from the literature.\n\nPros:  Although I was previously unfamiliar with the PCMC model, using a neural network parametrization seems novel and well motivated.  Moreover, the airline data experiment seems to validate that PCMC-Net is indeed effective, besting the other baselines in all three metrics.  \n\nCons:  I have two main concerns over the paper\u2019s experimental rigor\u2026\n\n#1 Lack of Simulation Studies: The paper makes claims about the representation properties of PCMC-Net but fails to validate them with simulation studies.  \n\n#2 Lack of data sets: Only one experiment on one data set is reported. \n\nFinal Evaluation:  While I found the paper\u2019s methodology well motivated and sensible, the experiments do not thoroughly validate the method as they contain no simulation studies and only one data set.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["alherit@gmail.com"], "title": "PCMC-Net: Feature-based Pairwise Choice Markov Chains", "authors": ["Alix Lh\u00e9ritier"], "pdf": "/pdf/c156e921437557833ce502262c1c9455daf0b48c.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a generic neural network architecture equipping Pairwise Choice Markov Chains choice models with amortized and automatic differentiation based inference using alternatives' and individuals' features.", "abstract": "Pairwise Choice Markov Chains (PCMC) have been recently introduced to overcome limitations of choice models based on traditional axioms unable to express empirical observations from modern behavior economics like context effects occurring when a choice between two options is altered by adding a third alternative.

Nonlinear features can be computed for both alternatives and individuals, and the resulting model beats all baselines in terms of log-likelihood and accuracy on an airline itinerary choice prediction task.\n\nOverall, this paper presented a simple but effective approach for using neural networks in the PCMC class of models. The experimental section is too limited, with results on only one dataset and no comparison of different architectural choices for how to incorporate neural networks into PCMC models, or analysis pointing toward what the features are learning that allows them to improve over earlier approaches. The text was also confusing in a number of places (possibly due to my lack of knowledge in choice modeling), and there\u2019s no discussion of related work incorporating neural networks into ranking-based models.\n\nComments:\n* Knowing nothing about choice modeling, I found the introduction hard to follow with lots of jargon that may be inaccessible to the broader ML community. It may be useful to specify the set of desired properties for these models up front, and then highlight how the different existing models do or don\u2019t satisfy these properties (e.g. uniform expansion, regularity, efficiency,  framing effects, etc.)\n* How is the proposed approach \u201camortized inference\u201d? \n* What\u2019s the triangle notation in P(a |> c) ?\n* It\u2019d be useful to say more as to why contractability/uniform expansion are useful components of a choice model.\n* \u201cAdditive smoothing at the cost of some efficacy\u201d - efficacy in what sense? Expressivity? Or worse performance? The same smoothing technique (minimum of epsilon) seems to be used in this approach.\n* Theorem 1 and proof do not consider some of the architectural choices of PCMC-Net (e.g. cartesian product layers, does d_a have to go to infinity?)\n* Contractability: why is this property desirable if you don\u2019t take advantage of it computationally?\n* Why is SGD + dropout training stable but the original MLE problem not?\n* Comparison to baselines using low-rank or other simple parameterizations of Q?\n* Table 1 should be moved to supplement\n* \u201cUsual rule of thumb\u201d -> cite something here? Not familiar with this\n* What is the impact of \\epsilon and dropout probability on model performance? From proofs I had expected \\epsilon tiny (1e-9) but you use 0.5\n* Would be useful to show how model performs on smaller dataset to gain intuition"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1644/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["alherit@gmail.com"], "title": "PCMC-Net: Feature-based Pairwise Choice Markov Chains", "authors": ["Alix Lh\u00e9ritier"], "pdf": "/pdf/c156e921437557833ce502262c1c9455daf0b48c.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a generic neural network architecture equipping Pairwise Choice Markov Chains choice models with amortized and automatic differentiation based inference using alternatives' and individuals' features.", "abstract": "Pairwise Choice Markov Chains (PCMC) have been recently introduced to overcome limitations of choice models based on traditional axioms unable to express empirical observations from modern behavior economics like context effects occurring when a choice between two options is altered by adding a third alternative.
