The method is evaluated on object manipulation environments based on MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012), Multiworld (Nair et al. 2018) and a Sawyer arm. The paper is clearly written; the authors discuss challenges and motivate their design choices well throughout the paper.\n\nScore justification:\n\nThe paper is mostly incremental but it provides enough contributions for acceptance. SMORL (Algorithm 1; the proposed method) is well-defined and motivated. The method outperforms a strong baseline (Soft Actor-Critic with Hindsight Experience Replay) in an object manipulation task with available ground-truth state representations. In the visual rearranging task, the proposed method performs better than existing self-supervised RL algorithms: RIG (Nair et al., 2019) and Skew-Fit (Pong et al., 2020) when using 1 and 2 objects. Experiments with a larger set of objects which demonstrate the compositional benefit of SMORL would strengthen the paper. I would also be interested in a visualization of the latent object representations learned by SMORL.\n\nPros:\n\nThe paper contributes to improving scene decomposition and object representation learning in model-free RL which has practical applications in robotics and object-oriented RL.\n\nThere is a discussion of existing limitations and challenges (limitations of VAEs in visual RL, defining reward functions in goal-conditioned RL), and how SMORL is meant to address them (goal-conditioned attention policy to handle set inputs, incorporating goal and object representations in the reward). \n\nExperiments in the multi-object environments showing that SMORL might be promising with and without ground-truth representations.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is no discussion of the computation cost of SMORL in comparison to the baselines (SAC with HER, RIG, Skew-Fit).\n\nThe \u201ccompositional\u201d aspect is unclear in the Experiments section. How does the \u201ccompositional generative world model\u201d translate to productivity, substitivity or other forms of compositional generalization with respect to the objects in the image?\n\nExperiments with a larger set of objects would help in highlighting the advantage of SMORL in a general multi-object visual RL setting.\n\nQuestions during rebuttal period: \n\nPlease address and clarify the cons above  \n\nTypos and structure:\n\nThe link in the abstract leads to an empty page\n\nEquation 1: G (distribution over the set of goals) is once bolded, once in italic\n\nIt seems there are two different citation styles used in the paper: (Jiang et al., 2019) and Jiang et al.

The proposed method is sufficiently novel, explores an important direction for self-supervised learning, and the results are quite strong.\n\nThe main motivation argued is that in more complex environments, it is difficult for fully unstructured reconstruction-based representation learning methods such as VAEs to recover a disentangled representation. This then causes difficulties running self-supervised RL algorithms such as RIG, which use the representation to compress the input, to set meaningful exploration goals, and for evaluating the reward. Using object-centric representations makes the representation more disentangled and improves RL, as demonstrated by the results. The paper would be strengthened by direct analysis of this hypothesis: for instance, correlations or measures of disentanglement between ground truth state and learned representation for SCALOR vs. VAE in the environments tested, particularly as number of objects increase.\n\nThe key novel contributions lie in how SCALOR is integrated with self-supervised learning. First, after learning the SCALOR representation from data, the proposed policy uses an attention mechanism to pay attention to reaching the goal for a single object at a time. One detail I did not understand was how the policy operates at test time. At training time, exactly one z^where is changed and the policy attempts to match that object. At test time, potentially many z^where could be different, so do you cycle between all the objects? Also, the paper would benefit from an ablation where you explore the choice of attention architecture; you could imagine that simply learning the object-centric representation and treating it as a flat representation like a VAE could also provide gains, so it is important to disentangle that effect from the novel policy architecture. The policy contribution is evaluated in Figure 3, where the success of SMORL+GT shows that the architecture makes manipulating a large number of objects possible.\n\nThe other differences to RIG have to do with goals and rewards. During self-supervised training, goals are sampled by sampling a new z^where for a single object, encouraging manipulation of exactly one object. This proposal seems logical, although in the long run it could potentially be an assumption that would not scale beyond object repositioning tasks. The reward is also modified to use the SCALOR latent, to penalize distance to the closest z^what object as the current goal with a threshold alpha for detecting the matching object. Again, the proposed reward function would be better evaluated with an ablation where you use the original reward from prior work -||z - z_g||.\n\nThe experiments show that the proposed method SMORL outperforms RIG and Skew-Fit on visual pushing tasks with many objects (and \u201crearranging\u201d, which is pushing with random initial positions of objects - having both sets of experiments potentially seems a bit redundant since it seems rearranging is strictly more difficult). SMORL is worse than an oracle (SAC+GT) which uses ground truth state information, but it seems to tend towards the oracle performance on even the more difficult tasks (seeing longer versions of the learning curve that show asymptotic performance would help understand this better).\n\nGenerally, the results on multi-object manipulation and self-supervised learning are strong. Further experiments as mentioned above would better allow the contributions to understood independently.\n\nMinor comments\n\nThe related work is a bit thin and narrow - it addresses the nearest-neighbor works well but does not address self-supervised methods and robotics methods more broadly; it would be best to use the related work to make the paper more understandable to the broader community who are not embedded in goal-conditioned RL (and potentially put it in at section 2 instead of at the end).\n\nPage 6: \u201cOut code\u201d -> \u201cour code\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general, we expect that it is beneficial for the policy to not always attend to entities conditional on the goal; we thus allow some heads to only attend to additional learned parametric queries (left out above for notational clarity).\u201d - did not understand this, it would be good to explain further what type of information this would include, and perhaps describe formally in the appendix.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning with Object-centric Representations", "authorids": ["~Andrii_Zadaianchuk1", "~Maximilian_Seitzer1", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Andrii Zadaianchuk", "Maximilian Seitzer", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["self-supervision", "autonomous learning", "object-centric representations", "visual reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Autonomous agents need large repertoires of skills to act reasonably on new tasks that they have not seen before.

We have added several parts in appendix that are addressing SCALOR\u2019s representation properties. In particular, we have added a disentanglement analysis in App A.2, where we compute the mutual information gap (MIG) for VAE and SCALOR representations. As the VAE\u2019s MIG scores were low for 1 and 2 objects, we decided to add only one comparison, however, if needed, other comparisons could be also added. In addition, we have added a mutual information matrix to show a more detailed picture of the disentanglement of SCALOR components.  \n\n*\u201cAt test time, potentially many $z^\\mathrm{where}$ could be different, so do you cycle between all the objects? \u201d*\n\nYes, we sequentially try to solve all the recognized sub-goals with different $z^\\mathrm{where}$. We clarified this in the paper, also described precisely in Algorithm 3 in the Appendix. \nWe discuss this aspect in the conclusion now (see second part of conclusion in the updated paper).  We believe that using a more sophisticated planning algorithm would allow for solving more complex tasks during evaluation.\n\n*\u201cThe paper would benefit from an ablation where you explore the choice of attention architecture; you could imagine that simply learning the object-centric representation and treating it as a flat representation like a VAE could also provide gains\u201d*\n\nThe choice of our policy was motivated by two different properties: \n - SCALOR representation are unordered, potentially different-sized sets\n - The policy should be able to concentrate on parts of the representation set\n\nDue to the first property we can not directly convert SCALOR representations to a fixed-length vector (the number of recognised objects can change, e.g. because of occlusions). We have done an ablation study where we explored 3 different choices of policies compatible with SCALOR representations. The results are presented in Appendix B of the updated paper.  First, we checked the importance of goal-conditional heads and an unconditional head in our architecture. We find out that without the goal-conditional heads, the SMORL algorithm performs significantly worse (while both are contributing to the final performance), showing the importance of goal-conditioned attention.  Next, we substitute the goal-conditioned attention module with the Set aggregation algorithm called DeepSet [1]. We observe that SMORL with DeepSets can also perform competitively on the two objects tasks, however, it is significantly worse on the out-of-distribution (OoD) task with one object. This shows that goal-condition attention contributes to the OoD generalization properties of our architecture. \n\n*\u201cThe proposed reward function would be better evaluated with an ablation where you use the original reward from prior work $-||z - z_g||$.\u201d* \n\nIndeed, such an ablation would be interesting, however given that representations are unordered it would require an additional matching of the recognized objects of current input set $z$ and the goal set $z_g$, so it cannot be performed.\n\n*\u201cSeeing longer versions of the learning curve that show asymptotic performance would help understand this better\u201d*\n\nThanks for mentioning this. We now have trained both SMORL and RIG twice longer and indeed get improved SMORL performance with average distance to the goal = 0.14 (2 objects), see plots in App. C. As the performance curve of SMORL still suggests further improvements with even more training, we will train longer and update the plots accordingly (not feasible in the rebuttal period due to computational restrictions). \n\n*\u201cThe related work is a bit thin and narrow - it addresses the nearest-neighbor works well but does not address self-supervised methods and robotics methods more broadly\u201d*\n\nWe decided to add an introductory passage where we cover the importance of self-supervised methods and visual RL. There, we also covered how self-supervised methods are used in goal-based RL as this could be less known. We also moved the related work section after the introduction, as per your suggestion.\n\n*\"It would be good to explain further what type of information this would include, and perhaps describe formally in the appendix.\"*\n\nThanks for spotting this.

To learn a policy that can take a variable number of object observations, the paper proposes the goal-conditioned attention policy, which can focus on objects of interests to achieve each sub-goal, and thus reduce the combinatorial complexity of multiple objects. The goal-conditioned attention policy can be efficiently trained with hindsight experience replay on the object-centric goal representations. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the goal-conditioned attention policy on dealing with multiple objects.\n\n### Strengths\n- The idea of learning composable object-centric visual representations and goal-conditioned attention policy is an intuitive and plausible way to tackle combinatorial challenges in multi-object manipulation tasks.\n- The experiments with ground truth states show that the proposed goal-conditioned attention policy can effectively handle multiple object manipulation tasks. \n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Based on Figure 4, any of the methods without ground truth states solve the tasks. Although the proposed method shows better learning performance in the Visual Rearranging task, the improvement is marginal to claim the proposed method can solve the tasks.\n- Why only up to 2 objects are considered in Figure 4? The proposed method has the advantage of dealing with multiple objects but did not show the benefit. It would be more convincing if the proposed method can reasonably deal with more than 2 objects.\n- The baseline could include recent visual policy learning methods using data augmentation [1,2].\n- The paper claims \"Self-supervised RL\" but it is not clear which part of the method is trained with self-supervised learning. The proposed method seems to consist of unsupervised representation learning and reinforcement learning.\n- The proposed method assumes that the sub-goals are independent of each other but it is not true in many cases, e.g., collisions between objects. \n- One of the claims in the paper is that the proposed representations and policy can work with a variable number of objects but the experiments do not cover this setup.\n\n### Questions and additional feedback\n- It would be better to include the architecture of the visual encoders for baselines and the proposed method.\n- It could be good to show the quality of learned representations, such as object pose prediction and classification.\n- The training time might be too short. The proposed method can be trained more (e.g., 1e6 environment steps).\n- The website link is provided but nothing is there.\n- How does the policy decide when to switch to the next sub-goal? Including how to rollout an episode toward sequential sub-goals with the proposed model would be helpful.\n\n### Overall assessment\nThe proposed method is intuitive and tackles an important problem of multi-object manipulation. However, the experiments and results are not yet convincing to claim the advantage in dealing with multiple objects. Overall, the reviewer thinks the paper requires more thorough experiments and is not ready to be published.\n\n\n[1] Laskin et al., Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data\n\n[2] Kostrikov et al., Image Augmentation Is All You Need: Regularizing Deep Reinforcement Learning from Pixels", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning with Object-centric Representations", "authorids": ["~Andrii_Zadaianchuk1", "~Maximilian_Seitzer1", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Andrii Zadaianchuk", "Maximilian Seitzer", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["self-supervision", "autonomous learning", "object-centric representations", "visual reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Autonomous agents need large repertoires of skills to act reasonably on new tasks that they have not seen before.

We have added this discussion into section 5.2 of the paper.\nThe main computational cost is in representation learning and the encoding of images to representations during the data collection for RL. Here, we can provide relative comparisons. While SCALOR training takes longer than VAE training because of SCALOR utilizing recurrence over the sequence of observations, it can be done once and then used throughout RL training. Thus, RL training for RIG and VAE is comparable as they also use their trained encoders for inference only. Skew-Fit training on the other side takes much more time as it requires additional VAE re-training during the RL phase. \n\n*\u201cThe \u201ccompositional\u201d aspect is unclear in the Experiments section. How does the \u201ccompositional generative world model\u201d translate to productivity, substitivity or other forms of compositional generalization with respect to the objects in the image?\u201d*\n\nOur architecture creates a factorized representation by design. Also, position and appearance are additionally decoupled. The experiments shown in Fig. 3 with 3 and 4 objects show empirical evidence for its effectivity. The number of different goal configurations grows exponentially with the number of objects. Thus we address a form of compositionality where the tasks are *composed* of largely independent subtasks (namely moving one object at a time). To clarify our scope we reworded the passages addressing the compositionally.  We also show the generalization capabilities of our system on unseen tasks with a different number of objects at test time (see 5.3 of updated paper).\n\n*\"Experiments with a larger set of objects would help in highlighting the advantage of SMORL in a general multi-object visual RL setting.\"*\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough computation resources to run all the hyperparameter optimization etc during the rebuttal period for more objects. The experiment reported in Fig. 3 with 3 and 4 objects show that good representations will transfer to good performance using our policy architecture. However, we agree that this is an important future direction.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning with Object-centric Representations", "authorids": ["~Andrii_Zadaianchuk1", "~Maximilian_Seitzer1", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Andrii Zadaianchuk", "Maximilian Seitzer", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["self-supervision", "autonomous learning", "object-centric representations", "visual reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Autonomous agents need large repertoires of skills to act reasonably on new tasks that they have not seen before.

We are glad that you like our work.\n\n*\u201cHow the \u201cevaluation on a novel task\u201d is done wasn\u2019t as clear (i.e. when we try to implement a given goal or sequence of goals)\u201d*\n\nThe algorithm sequentially attempts to solve all the recognized sub-goals with different $z^{\\mathrm{where}}$. We clarified this in the paper, also described precisely in Algorithm 3 in the Appendix. We believe that using a more sophisticated planning algorithm would allow for solving more complex tasks during evaluation. We discuss this in the paper now (Conclusions).\n\n*\u201cWhat happens when some of the \u201cobjects\u201d aren\u2019t achievable or controllable?.\u201d*\n\nRight now, the agent would still attempt to \u201csolve\u201d these tasks. At test time, the agent has several attempts to solve sub-goals with a limited time-budget, so it would not get stuck on these tasks. A discussion and future work direction is added to the Conclusion.\n\n*\u201cE.g. you see a slot which represents the robot arm, is this treated differently?\u201d*\n\nThe arm is typically represented by its own slot. It is not treated differently, but just considered as one of the discovered objects that are controllable. This way, one of the discovered tasks is actually reaching (i.e. manipulating yourself) of the robot arm to a specific location. We have verified that robots do quickly learn this sub-task also and can include this in the Appendix if needed. \n\n*\u201cHow good are SCALOR representations in your environment?\u201d*\n\nThis is a really good question. We have implemented different analyses of SCALOR\u2019s representation, which are presented in the Appendix A of the updated paper. To summarize: \nA clustering of $z^\\mathrm{what}$ components reveals a clear separation of the underlying objects, see A.1.\nThe representation of SCALOR is highly disentangled according to the Mutual Information Gap (MIG) measure in contrast to VAE representations, see A.2. As you have observed correctly, this requires a matching which we do using the clustering above.  \n\n*\u201cDid you try continuing training SCALOR in the RL phase? It would make the results stronger and less reliant on a good random exploration strategy.\u201d*\n\nFor this work, we restricted ourselves to training SCALOR on data from a random policy. As online training of SCALOR would take much more computational resources and potentially would be less stable (this intuition is supported by comparing the online Skew-Fit architecture with the passive RIG method). Nevertheless, it is an interesting future work direction (see second part of conclusion in the updated paper). \n\n*\u201cThe explanation about the issue of using tracking as part of the model directly wasn\u2019t especially clear to me. It might deserve a bit more expansion, especially in the Appendix?\u201d*\n\nWe provide more detail in Appendix E. The imperfection of the tracking algorithm provided by SCALOR can be exploited by the RL agent. \n\n*\u201cCould you add more samples of the environment\u2019s observations?\u201d*\n\nWe have added some trajectory traversals in A.3.\n\n*\u201cIt seems like the environment chosen is extremely similar to the standard Gym Fetch environment, did you try using it instead?\u201d*\n\nThe reason for choosing the multiworld environments is because it was used in the literature on visual RL. In principle the Gym Fetch environment could be modified to provide visual observations and multiple objects. \n\n*\u201cIt is not entirely true that MONet/IODINE \u201cdo not contain disentangled and interpretable features like position and scale\u201d. \nIt is true that they are not explicitly enforced (like done in SCALOR), but they do arise quite easily purely unsupervised. \u201d*\n\nThanks for spotting this. We have clarified this point in the updated paper. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning with Object-centric Representations", "authorids": ["~Andrii_Zadaianchuk1", "~Maximilian_Seitzer1", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Andrii Zadaianchuk", "Maximilian Seitzer", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["self-supervision", "autonomous learning", "object-centric representations", "visual reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Autonomous agents need large repertoires of skills to act reasonably on new tasks that they have not seen before.

The proposed method seems to consist of unsupervised representation learning and reinforcement learning.\"*\n\nIn our setting, both goals and rewards are constructed intrinsically from observations, and in this sense our method is self-supervised. Generally, the term self-supervised RL refers to methods that acquire a diverse repertoire of general-purpose robotic skills without reward signals using only observations. These skills can be reused and combined during test time. This view seems consistent with the literature we examined. To clarify this we added an introductory passage to the related work where we covered how self-supervision is used in goal-based RL without external rewards.\n\n*\"The proposed method assumes that the sub-goals are independent of each other but it is not true in many cases, e.g., collisions between objects.\"*\n\nIn the tasks we are considering, sub-goals are mostly independent as it is possible to achieve each of them independently without influencing other sub-goals. However, we agree that going towards more complex tasks such as object stacking would require rethinking this assumption, and is very interesting for future work. Therefore, we now mention this as a potential future direction in Sec. 6.\n\n\n*\"One of the claims in the paper is that the proposed representations and policy can work with a variable number of objects but the experiments do not cover this setup.\"*\n\nWe have added an additional experiment (see 5.3) where we evaluate our policy trained on 2 objects on 1 objects environment, showing that its performance is comparable to a policy trained on only one object. \n\n\n*\"It could be good to show the quality of learned representations, such as object pose prediction and classification.\"*\n\nWe have implemented different analyses of SCALOR\u2019s representation, which are presented in the Appendix A of the updated paper. To summarize: \n\n - A clustering of $z^\\mathrm{what}$ components reveals a clear separation of the underlying objects (see A.1), which indicates that the representations can easily be used for tasks such as classification.\n - The representation of SCALOR is highly disentangled according to the Mutual Information Gap (MIG) measure in contrast to VAE representations, see A.2. \n\n\n*\"How does the policy decide when to switch to the next sub-goal?\"*\n\nThe algorithm sequentially attempts to solve all the recognized sub-goals. We now clarify this in the paper and also added Algorithm 3 in the Appendix that describes it precisely. We also discuss other potential approaches to implement this in Section 6 now.\n\n*\"The training time might be too short. The proposed method can be trained more (e.g., 1e6 environment steps).\"*\n\nWe now have trained both SMORL and RIG twice longer and indeed get improved SMORL performance with average distance to the goal = 0.14 (2 objects), see plots in Appendix C. We will replace the plots in the main paper when all curves are finished. \n\n*\"Although the proposed method shows better learning performance in the Visual Rearranging task, the improvement is marginal to claim the proposed method can solve the tasks.\"*\n\n As we report above, longer training shows improvements upon the initially reported results. Nevertheless, it also alerts that progress is needed on the representation side, to close the gap to the ground truth curves. Regarding this gap, there is an inherent problem: the reward for training is defined on the camera image, which is actually having a slant view on the scene (as used in [1]). Thus the measure that is optimized by the agent is not directly matching our evaluation criterion.\n\n[1]: Nair, Ashvin V., et al. \"Visual reinforcement learning with imagined goals.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning with Object-centric Representations", "authorids": ["~Andrii_Zadaianchuk1", "~Maximilian_Seitzer1", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Andrii Zadaianchuk", "Maximilian Seitzer", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["self-supervision", "autonomous learning", "object-centric representations", "visual reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Autonomous agents need large repertoires of skills to act reasonably on new tasks that they have not seen before.

They can then leverage this on new tasks to solve them efficiently..\n\nOverall, I found this paper very interesting, clearly written, well executed (with very sensible decisions throughout) and presenting several good ideas, especially in how to leverage the additional object structure effectively. It demonstrates good early results in the novel field of Object-oriented RL.\n\nI have a few comments/questions:\n\n1. The explanation of how the goal-conditioned policies were trained was very clear, and I especially like how you use z_what and z_where to construct novel meaningful goals (which will tend to just force the policy to move objects around, but that is a good prior for your environment!). However how the \u201cevaluation on a novel task\u201d is done wasn\u2019t as clear (i.e. when we try to implement a given goal or sequence of goals). More precisely, it is said in several places that the goal z_g is decomposed in sub-tasks where only one of the slots is used as the target. \n   1. Could you provide more details on exactly how that is done? Do you learn p(z^where) on task later?\n   2. What happens when some of the \u201cobjects\u201d aren\u2019t achievable or controllable? E.g. I\u2019d expect that you see a slot which represents the robot arm, is this treated differently?\n2. How good are SCALOR representations in your environment? \n   1. It would be very helpful to show samples / traversals in the Appendix.\n   2. Similarly, comparing to the GT information you provide would be interesting (e.g. try to decode it? I understand you\u2019d have to match the slots up unfortunately)\n   3. Did you try continuing training SCALOR in the RL phase? It would make the results stronger and less reliant on a good random exploration strategy.\n3. Did the hard matching cause issues while learning? I\u2019d guess that the argmin is not too problematic because it is used in the reward computation only, but if you\u2019d consider extending this setting to learning the goal proposal function z_g, this seems like a limitation?\n   1. The explanation about the issue of using tracking as part of the model directly wasn\u2019t especially clear to me. It might deserve a bit more expansion, especially in the Appendix?\n4. How complex are the observations of the environment?\n   1. Could you add more samples of the environment\u2019s observations?\n   2. It seems like the environment chosen is extremely similar to the standard Gym Fetch environment, did you try using it instead? https://gym.openai.com/envs/FetchPickAndPlace-v0/ \n5. It is not entirely true that MONet/IODINE \u201cdo not contain disentangled and interpretable features like position and scale\u201d. \nIt is true that they are not explicitly enforced (like done in SCALOR), but they do arise quite easily purely unsupervised. \nEspecially, in my experience with both of these models, obtaining (and identifying) \u201cposition\u201d latents is rather easy. See for example Figure 5 in [1] and this animation [2].\n\nSo in summary, I believe this is a strong paper in a budding field, which deserves publication at ICLR and may interest many people there.\n\n* [1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11390\n* [2] https://twitter.com/cpburgess_/status/1091220207941701632 \n", "rating": "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3479/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Self-supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning with Object-centric Representations", "authorids": ["~Andrii_Zadaianchuk1", "~Maximilian_Seitzer1", "~Georg_Martius1"], "authors": ["Andrii Zadaianchuk", "Maximilian Seitzer", "Georg Martius"], "keywords": ["self-supervision", "autonomous learning", "object-centric representations", "visual reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Autonomous agents need large repertoires of skills to act reasonably on new tasks that they have not seen before.
