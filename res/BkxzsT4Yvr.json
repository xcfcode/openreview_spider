One can observe how for both left and right formulations the test set accuracies improve. We do not make a point that DGB(r) with alpha=1 is significantly better than the SGD results given the provided standard deviations. We do point in the subsequent experiments that having a finer control (through alpha) of SGDs intrinsic regularization properties can be beneficial. For example, the performance on the Air data set is 2x better than SGD with very small error bars. CIFAR10 results also point out towards the regularization effects of alpha but also tests the extensions of DGB to convolutional networks and layer normalization procedures. In this and subsequent experiments we show how input normalization (INN) converges faster than batch normalization (BN) and ultimately the results are very close. Thus INN presents itself as a viable alternative to BN and because it doesn\u2019t have learnable parameters it is more light weight. \n\nUnfortunately adding the tables in the main text would break the 8 page limit, this is the only reason they are in the appendix.\nThe main inspiration for this work comes from stochastic gradient boosting. The derivation described in section 2 shows how we can modify backprop to perform a gradient descent in functional space. With backprop first the gradients at each layer are calculated using the chain rule. Now instead of using them to calculate directly the gradients of the parameters w via o*r we can directly estimate the functional gradients r from the output of the respective linear layer. Solving this linear equation then gives us the weight update rule. Plugging in F = ow and h = ov in Eq 3 gives the weight update corresponding to the one in Eq 4 but obtained via gradient boosting. The weak learners F_t are summed in time; at each iteration we determine F_t = w_t*x_t and then use the weights gamma*w_t to update the parameter w. \n\nThanks for noticing, we have corrected to dL_t. Since F = o * w, dF/dw is o which is the output from the previous layer after the non-linearity.\n\nThank you, we have switched to v in the right hand side of Eq 7\n\nThank you, we have fixed the sum expression in Eq 12.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ebilal@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Deep Gradient Boosting -- Layer-wise Input Normalization of Neural Networks", "authors": ["Erhan Bilal"], "pdf": "/pdf/d01845ad7259e2e1dda59433fe3c9bcc46ff660a.pdf", "TL;DR": "What can we learn about training neural networks if we treat each layer as a gradient boosting problem?", "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been the dominant optimization method for training deep neural networks due to its many desirable properties.

Bellow are our answers, one paragraph for each comment.\n\nWe added running times for the MNIST experiment in the manuscript: \"When training on a single V-100 Nvidia GPU one SGD iteration took on average 0.0166 sec, one DGB(r) iteration took 0.0188 sec while in contrast DGB(l) took 0.1390 sec.\" With a small enough batch size, in this case 100 samples, the overhead is small, about 13% increase in running time. When using just the diagonal elements one training iteration takes 0.0175 sec.\n\nThe diagonal approximation doesn't perform as well as the full model and we use it just for the CIFAR10 experiments, where the convolutional version of DGB does not accept the full model. However, considering that the computational overhead is not too big its worth using the full model for dense networks with relatively small batch sizes.\n\nThe ideal alpha value varies from problem to problem, similar to how lamda values differ in the case of ridge regression. MNIST is highly susceptible to overfitting when using dense networks thus more regularization (ie larger alpha) helps. In other case, like Higgs where we have a lot of samples and very few features, the main issue is convergence not overfitting, thus smaller alphas work better. \n\nAs a regression problem AIR has a bigger range of values that need to be fit, thus a larger test set that is more representative is recommended. \n\nWe initially choose VGG because it lacked residual connections. Without residual connections DGB is easy to formulate and solve. Nonetheless, in the end input normalization (INN) can be applied to any architecture and we included in the manuscript results on ImageNet using ResNet101.\n\n A spike like that can happen in the early epochs if SGD finds a local sharp minima, but it quickly exited it.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ebilal@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Deep Gradient Boosting -- Layer-wise Input Normalization of Neural Networks", "authors": ["Erhan Bilal"], "pdf": "/pdf/d01845ad7259e2e1dda59433fe3c9bcc46ff660a.pdf", "TL;DR": "What can we learn about training neural networks if we treat each layer as a gradient boosting problem?", "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been the dominant optimization method for training deep neural networks due to its many desirable properties.

To apply DGB to the real CNNs, DGB is simplified to a input normalization layer, conditioned on the assumption that the convolution kernels should be small. After applying the input normalization layer to CNNs, the model could achieve comparable performance to the model with BN on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet recognition.\n\nThere are several concerns influencing my rating:\n* I cannot catch the advantages of this input normalization layer compared to BN. For example, could this input normalization layer help to address the problem that BN performs bad when batch size is small? The authors mention that this layer does not have additional parameters. But as I know, the parameter size of BN is small, which downgrades the significance of the proposed method. \n\n* In the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet experiments, only the VGG model is adopted, which obviously limits the application scope. Could the proposed method work well on ResNet, DenseNet or other more recent deep architectures?\n\n* In the DGB experiments, the improvements of DGB compared with SGD in four datasets all seem marginal, in which DGB is slower than SGD. \n\nOverall, I recognize the exploration of this method. But the advantages of DGB compared to SGD seem marginal.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ebilal@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Deep Gradient Boosting -- Layer-wise Input Normalization of Neural Networks", "authors": ["Erhan Bilal"], "pdf": "/pdf/d01845ad7259e2e1dda59433fe3c9bcc46ff660a.pdf", "TL;DR": "What can we learn about training neural networks if we treat each layer as a gradient boosting problem?", "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been the dominant optimization method for training deep neural networks due to its many desirable properties.

The method is interpreted as some kind of input normalization similar to Batch Norm later in the paper.\n\nAlthough the method seems to work and the idea is interesting, I\u2019m not entirely convinced by the experimental evidence. There are some technical concerns:\n\n- In section 2.1, I\u2019m only familiar with the MNIST dataset. Although the proposed method achieves slightly better performance than vanilla SGD, it\u2019s pretty weird the accuracy is only 98.xx% as a very simple CNN could easily achieve >99% accuracy on MNIST. This might be due to the simple network architecture used. A more modern architecture would be preferable in those experiments. Also the improvement on CIFAR seems to close to tell.\n\n- The writing seems to need some improvement. It\u2019s sometimes hard to follow the text, and some result tables (Table A1,A2,A3) are in the appendix not the main text. It might be better to reorganize the text and present everything about the method (fast approximation, CNN, interpretation as normalization) together.\n\n- The authors name the proposed method \u201cdeep gradient boosting\u201d, but I\u2019m not entirely sure how it is related to gradient boosting. Eq. 3 concerns sum of weak predictors, but how is this related to Eq. 4? The neural net F(x) doesn\u2019t seem to be exactly a sum of weak learners. I don\u2019t quite follow Eq. 5 \u2013 There seems to be missing something.\n\nTypos:\n- Eq. 5, d L_t instead of d L_T, and should there be a d \\phi / d w_ij term?\n- Eq. 7, v_t => v on the right-hand side.\n- Eq. 12, should be \\sum_i=1^B\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper735/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ebilal@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Deep Gradient Boosting -- Layer-wise Input Normalization of Neural Networks", "authors": ["Erhan Bilal"], "pdf": "/pdf/d01845ad7259e2e1dda59433fe3c9bcc46ff660a.pdf", "TL;DR": "What can we learn about training neural networks if we treat each layer as a gradient boosting problem?", "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been the dominant optimization method for training deep neural networks due to its many desirable properties.

One of the more remarkable and least understood quality of SGD is that it generalizes relatively well\non unseen data even when the neural network has millions of parameters. We hypothesize that in certain cases it is desirable to relax its intrinsic generalization properties and introduce an extension of SGD called deep gradient boosting (DGB). The key idea of DGB is that back-propagated gradients inferred using the chain rule can be viewed as pseudo-residual targets of a gradient boosting problem. Thus at each layer of a neural network the weight update is calculated by solving the corresponding boosting problem using a linear base learner. The resulting weight update formula can also be viewed as a normalization procedure of the data that arrives at each layer during the forward pass. When implemented as a separate input normalization layer (INN) the new architecture shows improved performance on image recognition tasks when compared to the same architecture without normalization layers.
