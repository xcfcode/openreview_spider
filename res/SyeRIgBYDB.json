Another interesting deviation is the idea to consider the newly updated weights {W_i}^{k+1} when updating the activations F_i^{k+1} in the backward pass.\n\nWhile potentially offering a faster convergence with respect to epochs, the nonlinear updates have two major drawbacks:\n\n1) While there are preliminary theoretical results (fixed points of the method are critical points), it remains unclear whether the computed update is still a descent direction on the original energy.  While not crucial, such a result would be reassuring and might give further insights into the method.\n\n2) Each update requires the solution of a nonconvex, nonlinear least squares problem which is prohibitively expensive to solve. Note that such nonlinear least squares updates are already proposed in (Carreira-Perpinan & Wang, 2014). When using ReLU activation, the non smoothness might be an issue for standard nonlinear least squares solvers such as Levenberg-Marquadt. \n\nFurthermore, the numerical results are unfortunately a bit discouraging. The experiments evaluate toy models on toy datasets and even there only a minor improvement with respect to epochs over SGD and Prox-BP is shown. Furthermore, the plots only consider epochs and not the running time. Due to the non-linear least squares problem, I assume that each epoch for the proposed method is way more costly. Therefore I consider the experimental evaluation too preliminary. A proper evaluation would require an implementation as an optimizer in state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks and a comparison with respect to running time to standard optimizers such as SGD with momentum or Adam on the GPU. \n\nThe reported performances for MNIST are surprisingly poor. Note that vanilla SGD with momentum reaches ~98.6% test set performance on such an architecture, while the overall highest reported accuracy in this paper is 98.0%. This might be due to momentum, and it would be interesting whether the proposed method could be combined with momentum or other optimizers such as Adam as in (Frerix et al. 2018).\n\nOverall, I don't see this a practical algorithm for training deep networks and there are few theoretical results. Therefore, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage. \n\nTo improve the paper, I would like to see an implementation of the method on the GPU in a recent deep learning framework and an evaluation on larger models / datasets. But I am doubtful this will reach competitive performance to standard optimizers. Also, it would be interesting to see how the precision in the inner nonlinear conjugate gradient solver effects outer convergence. It might be that the subproblem does not have to be solved with very high accuracy. \n\nMinor comments:\n* Missing citation: 'Difference Target Propagation', https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525, studies a similar type of algorithm."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2342/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2342/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Semi-Implicit Back Propagation", "authors": ["Ren Liu", "Xiaoqun Zhang"], "authorids": ["liur0810@sjtu.edu.cn", "xqzhang@sjtu.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Optimization", "Neural Network", "Proximal mapping", "Back propagation", "Implicit"], "TL;DR": "A new scheme in the spirit of error back propagation, with an implicit updates on the parameters sets and semi-implicit updates on the hidden neurons.", "abstract": "Neural network has attracted great attention for a long time and many researchers are devoted  to improve the effectiveness of  neural network training algorithms.

This is more-or-less expected thanks to the superior performance of implicit updates in general. So, it's good that the authors could make this work in the context of deep nets as well. Here are some more critical thoughts about the paper:\n\n\n1) There is not much theoretical justification about the idea in the paper. Proposition 1 is a simple argument about the fixed point of the procedure. The argument could be made more rigorous, right now it is a bit of a sketch. \nApart from Proposition 1, there is no more theory offered. The authors could appeal in the theory of implicit SGD for that, e.g., [1,2,3,4]. This theory suggests a lot of stability properties for the implicit SGD update of Equation (27).\n\n2) Somewhat related to (1), the authors could make a more clear connection to prior work. \nFor example, there is not mention of a very similar idea of \"implicit back propagation\" [5]. \nAlso the literature in implicit SGD procedures is highly relevant.\n\n3) Can we explain the results in Table 1 theoretically?\n\n\n\n[1] Bertsekas, \"Incremental proximal methods for large scale convex optimization.

Similar to BP, the difference on the neurons are propagated in a backward fashion and the parameters are updated with proximal mapping. The implicit update for both hidden neurons and parameters allows to choose large step size in the training algorithm. Finally, we also show that any fixed point of  convergent sequences produced by this algorithm is a stationary point of the objective loss function. The experiments on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed semi-implicit BP algorithm leads to  better performance in terms of both loss decreasing and training/validation accuracy, compared to SGD and a similar algorithm ProxBP.", "code": "https://github.com/liur0810/semi-implicit-back-propagation/", "pdf": "/pdf/b0d22ceab6d8e278c1b249e45cb4c1d075aa5202.pdf", "paperhash": "liu|semiimplicit_back_propagation", "original_pdf": "/attachment/b0d22ceab6d8e278c1b249e45cb4c1d075aa5202.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nliu2020semiimplicit,\ntitle={Semi-Implicit Back Propagation},\nauthor={Ren Liu and Xiaoqun Zhang},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyeRIgBYDB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
