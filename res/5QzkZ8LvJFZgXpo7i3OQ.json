In this paper we propose to generalize recent end-to-end active visual recognizers into a controller-recognizer framework. In this framework, the interfaces with an external manipulator, while the recognizer classifies the visual input adjusted by the manipulator. We describe two recently proposed controller-recognizer models-- the recurrent attention model (Mnih et al., 2014) and spatial transformer network (Jaderberg et al., 2015)-- as representative examples of controller-recognizer models. Based on this description we observe that most existing end-to-end controller-recognizers tightly couple the controller and recognizer. We consider whether this tight coupling is necessary, and try to answer this empirically by investigating a decoupled controller and recognizer.  Our experiments revealed that it is not always necessary to tightly couple them, and that by decoupling the controller and recognizer, there is a possibility to build a generic controller that is pretrained and works together with any subsequent recognizer.  \n", "pdf": "/pdf/5QzkZ8LvJFZgXpo7i3OQ.pdf", "paperhash": "moczulski|a_controllerrecognizer_framework_how_necessary_is_recognition_for_control", "conflicts": ["umontreal.ca", "nyu.edu", "ox.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Marcin Moczulski", "Kelvin Xu", "Aaron Courville", "Kyunghyun Cho"], "authorids": ["marcin.moczulski@stcatz.ox.ac.uk", "kelvin.xu@umontreal.ca", "aaron.courville@umontreal.ca", "kyunghyun.cho@nyu.edu"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
