At infinite depth the kernel has the form a*identity+b*(all-one matrix), and the paper studies how the large-depth NTK converges to the limit in three cases: chaotic, ordered, and critical line. The paper draws connection between these behaviors with the trainability and generalization of corresponding neural networks.

However, the exposition is confusing and I'm missing some key points of this paper. Therefore I cannot recommend acceptance at this time. See below for detailed comments.\n\n1. I don't really get how the spectrum of large-depth NTK is connected to generalization. At infinite depth, the NTK is just a trivial kernel Theta^*, as noted in the paper.

We agree with the overall comments that our exposition could be significantly clearer. We have taken initial steps in this direction and will continue to improve the clarity of our results.\n\nAs you correctly note, in the general case the spectrum of the NTK is deeply connected to specific properties of the dataset. This makes it difficult to study generalization and trainability in the general case and so simplifications must be made. Some approaches such as [1] choose to make progress here by considering simple data manifolds such as the unit  hypercube or hypersphere. However, we note that another place where simplicity can emerge is in the large depth limit and we believe that we can use this limit to gain significant insight into the properties of networks described by the NTK. \n\nAt large depth we show that Theta becomes simple in the sense that it can be written as a small correction to the limiting kernel. Moreover, the scaling of the correction with depth is independent of dataset and can be studied in general for classes of neural network architectures. We leverage this property to make general comparisons between fully-connected networks and convolutional networks with-and-without pooling. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. I don't really get how the spectrum of large-depth NTK is connected to generalization. At infinite depth, the NTK is just a trivial kernel Theta^*, as noted in the paper. It is claimed that a finite-depth correction Eqn. (7) \"captures the generalization.\" How exactly does it capture the generalization? Generalization appears to be highly dependent on the data distribution. I don't understand how the paper arrives at its conclusions regarding generalization.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for bring this up.  We claim that this is a necessary condition for generalization. The linear operator $\\Delta^l$, in the infinite width setting (where the NTK captures dynamics), measures the distance between the finite depth (denoted by $l$) and the fixed-point (i.e. $l=\\infty$, data independent) prediction. We used this to lower bound the generalization error; see equation (9) in the new version. The norm of this operator decays exponentially in the ordered and chaotic phases, and polynomially on the critical line. A necessary condition for the generalization error to be small is $\\Delta^l$ shouldn\u2019t be too small.  Thus after $O(-\\log \\Delta^l)$ layers, the generalization error has to be large. Green and yellow lines in Figure 3 correspond to $-\\log \\Delta^l$ ~ constant. To pass these arguments from kernel to finite (large) width network, we applied results from Jacot, https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572; Lee, et al https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06720, etc, that the training dynamics of real network is $1/\\sqrt n$ away from its linearization and converges to the infinite width (i.e. analytic NTK) dynamics as $n$, the width of the network, goes to infinity.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that any fine-grained analysis of generalization should take the data distribution, optimization method, etc. into account. However, finding a necessary condition for generalization of neural networks in terms of hyper-parameters are important research questions. We believe that the large depth setting allows us to study these questions in a uniquely systematic manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The paper (esp. Section 3) is written in a way very unfriendly to someone who is not familiar with previous work, with notation, derivations and conclusions buried in paragraphs. I wish there were some theorems clearly and formally summarizing the conclusions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe agree with this comment; thanks for the feedback!

It's unclear whether the studied regime (large depth, probably even larger with) is relevant in practice. Although there are experimental results provided, the CNN experiments are for the infinite-width NTK. It's unclear how they look like for practical networks.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLarger models often give superb performance, e.g. WideResNet, BERT https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805 (increasing the number of layers and heads), Efficient-Nets (increasing the resolution of the input images, widths and depths simultaneously) https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946. How to scale up the size of the models correctly and find the right range of hyper-parameters (weight/bias variances, learning rates, etc.) so that the models are able to train and generalize are important research problems in deep learning. Our paper gives insights into these questions: e.g. increasing the depth hurts generalization and trainability in the ordered phase, while in the chaotic phase, improve trainability but test performance degrades, showing a trade-off between generalization and optimization.  Note that previous works were not able to train deep networks in the chaotic phase because the learning rates are not chosen correctly. Understanding the effects of architecture modules (pooling, normalization, dropout, etc.) to generalization and trainability is critical for  architecture design. For example, we show that there is a trainability-generalization trade-off for `average pooling`: it increases the condition number of the NTK by $d$ (the window size of the pooling layer), but slow down the decay of $\\Delta^l$ by $d$. We show that (new version of the paper), dropout improves the trainability of the network (or more precisely, the condition of the NTK) in the ordered phases and induces an implicit regularization that is similar to L2-regularization.\n\n\n\n4.

We appreciate your time and agree that our exposition needs to be improved. We have taken steps towards this in a round of revisions and will continue to improve the clarity of our writing. We believe our paper will be stronger as a result.\n\n\n1) It looks to me that Eq(2) and Eq(6) are contradictory, where T already contains sigma_w and simga_b in Eq(2) but re-multiplied in eq(6).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for pointing out the typos. The correct definition of $T$ does not contain $\\sigma_b$, $\\sigma_w$. Please see Eq(2) and (12) in the new version. \n\n\n2) The paper analyzes the dynamics by assuming the variances of inputs are q*, which is debatable. The variance q^l also evolves with the depth increases. It is unclear whether the condition number will change if you takes the evolution of q^l into considered.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn practice, the diagonal term $q^l$ converges much faster then the off-diagonal; see Figure 1 in Ben Pool etc. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05340.pdf. This observation has been widely used in followup work to analyze the dynamics with q^l -> q* with excellent agreement [1,2,3]. Moreover, one can of course choose to normalize data so that the norm is exactly q* in the first layer. Nonetheless, we agree that we could do a better job of making this point in the text and have added a few sentences to this effect.\n\n\n3) It is unclear how Eq(9) comes directly from Eq(6), and there aren't any rigorous proofs in the Appendix. Similarly for eq(14).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for pointing out the gap between (6) and (9). The main source of confusion comes from typos in the definition of $\\chi_1$ in the paragraph below equation (8). The correction definition should be $\\chi_1 = \\sigma_w^2 \\dot T(q^*)$.  We have add new equations (Eq (13), (14) in the new version) to bridge the gap. \n\n\n4) In the paragraph below Eq(11) the paper states that \\Theta* becomes an all one-matrix. However, Eq(11) states the diagonal converges to q*/(1-xi_1), but the paragraph below Eq(9) states the off-diagonal converges to q*_{ab}/(1- xi_c). Because q*=q*_{ab} as you stated nearby, do you mean xi_1 = xi_c ? \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe could indeed improve the clarity of our discussion here. Note that in the ordered phase (where \\Theta* becomes an all-ones matrix) it is indeed the case that \\chi_c* == \\chi_1 because c* = 1 is the only stable fixed-point.  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n5) In the first paragraph of Section 3.3, p^l = q* and p^l=l q*. \n\n\nThanks. The first equation should be $q^l = q^*$. \n\n\n6) In the 2nd contribution, you mentioned \"eigenvector correlation\", while I cannot find anywhere else introducing this.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for pointing out this. We should have been more precise about this. We were referring to $Delta^l$. We have worked to clarify the exposition around $\\Delta^l$ in general.\n\n\n7) The plots of Figure 1(b) should behave like convex if the kappa really evolves like x_1^l / l. However it is concave. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for bringing this up. To capture the polynomial correction, the Y-axis is indeed set to be $\\chi_1^l \\kappa^l$ (rather than $\\kappa$), which should be roughly $1/l$ for large depth. We will make the labels more visible.\n\n\n8) In the first experiment, you state \"To confirm that the maximal feasible learning rate are ... 2/(lambda_max)\". However, learning rates are never discussed in this paper. It is confusing why this experiment is useful. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for pointing this out. We agree we should have clarified our interest in the maximum feasible learning rate. We have two reasons for investigating this point: 1) While it has been hypothesized in a number of recent papers that the maximum feasible learning rate scales like $\\frac 2 {\\lambda_{max}}$, we are not aware of a systematic study of this point. 2) In order to conduct subsequent experiments it was necessary to scale the learning rate appropriately since $\\lambda_{max}$ varies by several orders of magnitude over the range of hyperparameters / depths that we study. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2195/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2195/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xlc@google.com", "jpennin@google.com", "schsam@google.com"], "title": "Disentangling Trainability and Generalization in Deep Learning", "authors": ["Lechao Xiao", "Jeffrey Pennington", "Sam Schoenholz"], "pdf": "/pdf/0b050b4d3abc9c7e35c427bb9dc5989d85eea855.pdf", "TL;DR": "Disentangling Trainability and Generalization in Deep Learning via the Evolution of the Neural Tangent Kernels", "abstract": "A fundamental goal in deep learning is the characterization of trainability and generalization of neural networks as a function of their architecture and hyperparameters.

By analyzing the conditional number and eigenvalues, they identify three phases of hyper-parameters; 1) In the chaotic phase NTK converges to an identity matrix, which is easy to train but hardly to generalize. 2) In the ordered phase NTK converges to an all-one matrix, which is hard to train but generalizes well. 3) In the critical phase the conditional number converges to a constant. Furthermore, they also analyze the influence of pooling and flattening in CNNs and identify potential regimes where pooling hurts the generalization. They conduct empirical experiments to supporting their theoretical analyses.\n\nHowever, I think this paper is worth of more revisions because many theoretical analyses are unjustified. And some potential typos makes the analyses even more difficult to understand.\n\n1) It looks to me that Eq(2) and Eq(6) are contradictory, where T already contains sigma_w and simga_b in Eq(2) but re-multiplied in eq(6).\n2) The paper analyzes the dynamics by assuming the variances of inputs are q*, which is debatable. The variance q^l also evolves with the depth increases. It is unclear whether the condition number will change if you takes the evolution of q^l into considered.\n3) It is unclear how Eq(9) comes directly from Eq(6), and there aren't any rigorous proofs in the Appendix. Similarly for eq(14).\n4) In the paragraph below Eq(11) the paper states that \\Theta* becomes an all one-matrix. However, Eq(11) states the diagonal converges to q*/(1-xi_1), but the paragraph below Eq(9) states the off-diagonal converges to q*_{ab}/(1- xi_c). Because q*=q*_{ab} as you stated nearby, do you mean xi_1 = xi_c ? \n5) In the first paragraph of Section 3.3, p^l = q* and p^l=l q*. \n6) In the 2nd contribution, you mentioned \"eigenvector correlation\", while I cannot find anywhere else introducing this.\n7) The plots of Figure 1(b) should behave like convex if the kappa really evolves like x_1^l / l. However it is concave. \n8) In the first experiment, you state \"To confirm that the maximal feasible learning rate are ... 2/(lambda_max)\". However, learning rates are never discussed in this paper. It is confusing why this experiment is useful. \n\nGenerally speaking, I think the paper needs careful revisions to support its theoretical analyses.

In this paper, we discuss these challenging issues in the context of wide neural networks at large depths where we will see that the situation simplifies considerably. To do this, we leverage recent advances that have separately shown: (1) that in the wide network limit, random networks before training are Gaussian Processes governed by a kernel known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, (2) that at large depths the spectrum of the NNGP kernel simplifies considerably and becomes ``weakly data-dependent'', and (3) that gradient descent training of wide neural networks is described by a kernel called the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) that is related to the NNGP. Here we show that by combining the in the large depth limit the spectrum of the NTK simplifies in much the same way as that of the NNGP kernel. By analyzing this spectrum, we arrive at a precise characterization of trainability and generalization across a range of architectures including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We find that there are large regions of hyperparameter space where networks will train but will fail to generalize, in contrast with several recent results. By comparing CNNs with- and without-global average pooling, we show that CNNs without average pooling have very nearly identical learning dynamics to FCNs while CNNs with pooling contain a correction that alters its generalization performance.
