Sorry about breaking this up into 2 parts, it seems we hit the post limit. The results for TriviaQA reranking is in part 2 of this response.\n\nRE: motivation of design of model and novelty\n\nOne lesson from prior work on extractive question answering [2, 14] show that the initial encoding of the inputs are crucial to model performance (whereas subsequent decoding matter much less). The coarse-grain and fine-grain modules of the CFC emphasize two complementary approaches to build this initial encoding. The first approach is to read the document with respect to the question, and then find the appropriate answer. The initial encodings produced here are highly relevant to the question, but they do not capture the context in which the answer is mentioned. The second approach is to read the document with respect to the candidate answer, and then consider how relevant this answer is to the question. The initial encodings produced here precisely model the context in which the answer is mentioned, however they do not capture interactions with the question until later. We designed the CFC to incorporate these two complementary approaches into a single network. As a result, our model is able to retain and focus on different aspects of the input (this is shown in our analysis in sections 4.1 and 4.2) and achieve state-of-the-art results on a competitive reading comprehension task.\n\n\nRE: motivation behind the particular usage of self-attention and coattention\n\nWe use co-attention to build codependent representations of two inputs. This has been crucial to extractive question answering as well as visual question answering [1-3]. We use self-attention in this work as a means to aggregate information over a variable-length sequence. Prior work have shown its effective across a wide range of NLP tasks [4-8]. An alternative method to information aggregation is pooling, which we compare against in our ablation studies and find to perform worse than self-attention. Our intuition is that self-attention allows for more flexibility in the model and is able to learn task-specific pooling strategies (e.g. emphasize certain regions of the input space over others, as oppose do maximization/minimization/average over features)\n\nThe particular design we choose is influenced by what kind of information aggregation we would like to perform. For the coarse-grain module, we would like to first interpret a supporting text with respect to the query, hence we apply coattention over the supporting text and the query. Next, we would like to summarize each variable length supporting text, hence we apply self-attention over each coattention output. Next, we would like to produce a summary of the document collection, which consists of a variable number of supporting texts, hence we apply self-attention again over the set of supporting text summaries. Finally, we query this summary using an answer summary, which we also produce using self-attention. For the fine-grain module, we must first summarize each variable length mention of the answer, hence we apply self-attention. Next, we would like to interpret these mentions with respect to the question, hence we apply coattention. Finally, we would like to summarize this reinterpretation to produce a score, hence we apply self-attention again."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering", "abstract": "End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document.

[1] find that contextual embeddings capture a surprising amount of common sense knowledge (please see the EMNLP 2018 presentation on new SWAG results [2]). Perhaps this accounts for the consistent gains brought about by CoVe [3], ELMo [4], and BERT [5] on a wide variety of NLP tasks.\n\nUnfortunately we could not do these experiments in time due to computational constraints. In particular, on-the-fly evaluation of contextualized embeddings required too much memory given the large documents lengths in Qangaroo. We plan to look into practical ways of using these embeddings in future work.\n\n\nRE: coref captures dependencies more accurately than hierarchical attention\n\nWe mean that the type of coref we use (e.g. entity matching) introduces very precise direct links, whereas links implicitly captured by soft hierarchical attention is gated and hence noisy. We will clarify this in the writing.\n\n\nRE: list of unanswerable questions\n\nWe agree and will release a list of unanswerable questions found during our manual inspection of a subset of the dataset.\n\n\nRE: reference to related works in memory network-based QA and query-focused multi-document summarization\n\nThank you bringing this to our attention. We will include these in our related works section. We\u2019ll also explore the applicability of our method to query-focused multi-document summarization in the future.\n\nAfter receiving our reviews, we experimented with our model on another task of reranking extractive question answering. We ran preliminary experiments in which we applied our model to rerank the outputs produced by (the merge version of) BiDAF++ [9] on TriviaQA [8]. In particular, we rerank the top-50 answers produced by BiDAF++ (let\u2019s refer to the as the \u201cN-best list\u201d). We find that on the subset of the dev set in which the ground-truth answer is present in the N-best list (which is 86.8% of the data), reranking using our method improves exact match accuracy (EM) from 59.8% to 63.2% and F1 from 64.5% to 67.8%. On the subset in which the ground-truth answer is not present in the N-best list (which is 13.2% of the data), reranking using our method improves EM from 17.5% to 18.4% and F1 from 22.2% to 23.2%. On the entire dev set, reranking using our method improves EM from 54.0% to 57.1% and F1 from 58.7% to 61.7%. Hence, we think our method can be used to improve existing span-extractive models as a reranker (e.g. similar to [6-7]). We will add this result to the paper.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05326\n[2] https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nRJDlDNVsbBf75tmYIwZj48HM9l4kIxA/view?usp=sharing\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00107\n[4] https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365\n[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05759\n[7] https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05116\n[8] https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551\n[9] https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10723\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering", "abstract": "End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document.

After considering your feedback we ran preliminary experiments in which we applied our model to rerank the outputs produced by (the merge version of) BiDAF++ [13] on TriviaQA [12]. In particular, we rerank the top-50 answers produced by BiDAF++ (let\u2019s refer to the as the \u201cN-best list\u201d). We find that on the subset of the dev set in which the ground-truth answer is present in the N-best list (which is 86.8% of the data), reranking using our method improves exact match accuracy (EM) from 59.8% to 63.2% and F1 from 64.5% to 67.8%. On the subset in which the ground-truth answer is not present in the N-best list (which is 13.2% of the data), reranking using our method improves EM from 17.5% to 18.4% and F1 from 22.2% to 23.2%. On the entire dev set, reranking using our method improves EM from 54.0% to 57.1% and F1 from 58.7% to 61.7%. Hence, we think our method can be used to improve existing span-extractive models as a reranker (e.g. similar to [9-10]). We will add this result to the paper.\n\nThe setup in the ARC/RACE/RACE-open are such that\n- The evidence is a collection of short sentences (a key challenge is IR)\n- The answers are propositions whose truth values are determined by evidence in the sentences\n\nIn contrast, Qangaroo is such that\n- The evidence is a collection of paragraphs obtained from relation-guided knowledge graph traversal\n- The answers are plausible entities for the relation in interest\n\nWhile we think both of these settings are interesting, our model is designed for the latter and unsuitable for the former since the the answers are not entities, so the fine-grain module does not have entity mentions to attach to. One can hypothetically extract entities from non-entity answers, however for ARC/RACE/RACE-open, multiple answer choices refer to the same entity (e.g. he did A vs. he did B). That is, the mentions are shared between answers and do not distinguish between answers. Consequently the output of the fine-grain module for answers that share entities would be the same.\n\n\nRE: question on encoder-less ablation\n\nThe fine-grain module still has a bidirectional GRU inside the coattention (Please see eq. 18 and eq. 7)\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01604\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00106\n[4] https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10296\n[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01052\n[6] https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07045\n[7] https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\n[8] https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09655\n[9] https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05759\n[10] https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05116\n[11] https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08092\n[12] https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551\n[13] https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10723\n[14] https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering", "abstract": "End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document.

The coarse-grained module reads all of the supporting documents for QA, whereas the fine-grained one reads the local context surrounding each candidate entity's mentions. Both modules are used to predict the score of a candidate entity being the answer, with the final result being the sum of the two scores.\n\nThis is a fine paper and achieves a new state of the art on the Qangaroo multi-hop QA dataset. The paper is clearly written, presents the models intuitively, while not foregoing technical detail should that be interesting to a reader. I appreciated the ablation results, as well as the qualitative analyses. The overall idea of encoding different levels of context is an important one, and I am glad that this paper shows that this approach works for a complex QA task.\n\nThere are two downsides to the paper. The first is that I am not sure it is really accurate to call the coarse-grained model as such, as it still seems to require passing every word in the supporting documents to an encoder. It seems to be more aimed at capturing global information from the supporting documents, rather than to make a quick, high-level pass at inference. The second weakness is that the coarse- and fine-grained modules barely interact at all, as their prediction scores are simply summed at the output layer. It is nice that even such a simple method of interaction already works so well, but I would have expected some exploration or comment on how more interactions could be enabled.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering", "abstract": "End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document.

Here is a relevant work: \"Knowledgeable Reader: Enhancing Cloze-Style Reading Comprehension with External Commonsense Knowledge\" by Mihaylov and Frank, 2018.\n\n- \"The second type (28% of errors) results from questions that are not answerable.

Also, I would suggest to cover the query-focused multi-document summarization area in the related work section because they also require evidence synthesis from multiple documents to address a query.

Where the coarse-grained answer scoring model computes the scores with the attention over the whole passages, and the fine-grained one only uses local contexts for each answer option (candidate).\n\nThe proposed approach was evaluated on the only dataset of WikiHop, and achieved large improvement over the other methods on the leaderboard. However, I found the paper lack of motivation about the designs of the coarse and fine scoring models. For example, why using self-attention after GRU and co-attention in the two answer scoring models?\n\nAnother concern I have is about the novelty. Besides the complicated model designs, the coarse and fine scoring models are both following some common ideas in previous work. And each model could achieve on-par results compared to previous baselines. This makes me feel that the whole approach looks more like model combination of two not-so-novel (and not very well-motivated) models.\n\nThirdly, the only evaluation on WikiHop brings more problems to the above two points. Since the motivation of the architecture design is not very clear, I am not sure whether the architectures could generalize to other benchmarks. Similar concern for the model combination approach.\n\nMoreover, the proposed approach is a general architecture for multiple-choice datasets requiring multiple evidence. To verify its generalizability, I suggest the authors add further experiments on one dataset from the following ones: either multi-choice QA datasets like ARC and RACE/RACE-open, or other open-domain QA datasets like TriviaQA, by treating the re-ranking of answer predictions as multi-choice QA problems (like the approach in Evidence Aggregation for Open-Domain QA from ICLR2018).\n\nA minor question: why the CFC w/o encoder could still work so well? At least the fine-grained scoring model should heavily rely on encoders. Otherwise, according to Eq (17), the fine-grained model cannot use any contextual information.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper340/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering", "abstract": "End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document.
