It also seems like an advance on the hard-to-optimize Eureqa method.\n \n Cons:\n I agree with the authors that Reviewer 5's comments aren't very helpful, but this paper really does ignore or dismiss a lot of recent progress and related methods. Specifically:\n - The authors claim that cross-validation can't be used to choose the model, since it wouldn't encourage extrapolation - but why not partition the data in contiguous chunks, as is done in time-series methods?\n - The authors introduce an annealing trick to help with the L1 objective, but there is a rich literature on gradient-based optimization methods with L1 regularization that address exactly this problem.\n - The authors mostly consider toy data, limiting the potential impact of their method.\n - The authors don't compare against closely related methods developed to address the exact same setting. Namely, Schmit + Lipson's Eureqa method, and the Gaussian process methods of Duvenaud, Lloyd, Grosse, Tenenbaum and Ghahramani.\n - The authors invent their own ad-hoc model-selection procedure, again ignoring a massive literature.\n \n Given the many \"cons\", it is recommended that this paper not be presented at the conference track, but be featured at the workshop track.", "decision": "Invite to Workshop Track"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Extrapolation and learning equations", "abstract": "In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a\nsuitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and  outputs.\nIn the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and  generalize results.

The approximation only holds for b=Pi/4. We change the manuscript accordingly. Typo: yes indeed the sign was missing.\n\nOnly 4 variables: \u00a0True, we only considered cases with up to 5 variables (robotic arm). We did not try it on systems with many more variables and we expect that lots of training data would be required to be able to uncover the true functional form in case all variables interact. So interpolation will scale but extrapolation might not, at least not to hundreds.\n\nBase functions, and universal approximator: It is correct that sine, cosine, and multiplication are the new base functions, however, the model is not just considering a linear combination of those, but also their functional composition (sine of cosine times \u2026).\nSince division is not a base function Eq. 13 cannot be represented exactly. In this case, EQL will just act as a normal approximator and performs well in the interpolation regime but fails on extrapolation like all other methods. EQL is surely a universal approximator because MLPs are a subclass of EQL.

This paper describes a method to extrapolate a given dataset and predict formulae with naturally occurring functions like sine, cosine, multiplication etc.                                                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nPros                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n- The approach is rather simple and hence can be applied to existing methods. The major difference is incorporating functions with 2 or more inputs which was done successfully in the paper. \n            \n- It seems that MLP, even though it is good for interpolation, it fails to extrapolate data to model the correct function. It was a great idea to use basis functions like sine, cosine to make the approach more explicit.                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nCons                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n- Page 8, the claim that x2 cos(ax1 + b) ~ 1.21(cos(-ax1 + \u03c0 + b + 0.41x2) + sin(ax1 + b + 0.41x2)) for y in [-2,2] is not entirely correct. There should be some restrictions on 'a' and 'b' as well as the approximate equality doesn't hold for all real values of 'a' and 'b'. Although, for a=2*pi and b=pi/4, the claim is correct so the model is predicting a correct solution within certain limits.      \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n- Most of the experiments involve up to 4 variables. It would be interesting to see how the neural approach models hundreds of variables.                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n- Another way of looking at the model is that the non-linearities like sine, cosine, multiplication act as basis functions. If the data is a linear combination of such functions, the model will be able to learn the weights. As division is not one of the non-linearities, predicting expressions in Equation 13 seems unlikely. Hence, I was wondering, is it possible to make sure that this architecture is a universal approximator.                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nSuggested Edits                                                                                                                                                                                           \n- Page 8, It seems that there is a typographical error in the expression 1.21(cos(ax1 + \u03c0 + b + 0.41x2) + sin(ax1 + b + 0.41x2)).

We select for models with a small number of active units. For \u201csimulating\u201d multiplication with additive units a large amount of units are required with would favor instances with a different representation. The second reason is that the learned multiplication would only work in the training domain and would to extrapolate. \n\nTo 2: We need prior knowledge on the function class of the underlying dynamics. Again a generic polynomial is a universal approximator and can also be used for interpolation. True, EQL can also learn polynomials up to order (2*number of layers), BUT it also contains the trigonometric functions and their powers and products. The exhaustive search through all functional forms is quickly intractable. In order to extrapolate the underlying functional expression has to be identified. Simply fitting a polynomial will not do (and is likely to extrapolate badly).\n\nTo 3:\nThank you for the interesting view of interpreting extrapolation as domain adaptation with no data of the target task. Unfortunately, we do not think that the situation will lead to provable bounds, at least not comparable ones to Ben-David's, except if we make assumptions about the underlying data distribution. This we would like to avoid, especially in the context of modeling a physical system, as we do, where future data (conditions) will not even be i.i.d.. Note that even if we would have some (unlabeled) target data, Ben-David's bound would not be informative: by definition the support of the training data is disjoint from the data distribution during extrapolation, so the discrepancy terms in the bound would almost surely be maximal, and the bound vacuous.\n\n\nTo 4:\nWe assume you mean methods such as Gaussian Processes.\nFor the GP: Constructing a kernel that can express our hypothesis class of\nfunctions would be very difficult, since it's not just linear\ncombinations of base elements, but also their concatenations.\nJust products of inputs are not hard (polynomial kernel), but products of intermediate terms would, require some hierarchical construct, with kernel acting on the output of other kernels. \nIf we are not using our function class but general kernels then both mean extrapolation performance and \u201cuncertainty\u201d will grow very quickly when departing from the training domain."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Extrapolation and learning equations", "abstract": "In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a\nsuitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and  outputs.\nIn the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and  generalize results.

This paper clearly shows that the knowledge of the underlying system dynamics is crucial in this case. The experiments clearly showed the promising potential of the proposed EQL model. I think EQL is very interesting also from the perspective of interpretability, which is crucial for data analysis in scientific domains.\n\nQuesions and comments:\n\n1. Multiplication units. By the universal approximation theorem, multiplication can also be represented by a neural network in the usual sense. I agree with the authors' explanation of interpolation and extrapolation, but I still don't quite understand why multiplication unit is crucial here. I guess is it because this representation generalises better when training data is not that representative for the future?\n\n2. Fitting an EQL vs. fitting a polynomial. It seems to me that the number of layers in EQL has some connections to the degree of the polynomial. Assume we know the underlying dynamics we want to learn can be represented by a polynomial. Then what's the difference between fitting a polynomial (with model selection techniques to determine the degree) and fitting an EQL (with model selection techniques to determine the number of layers)? Also your experiments showed that the selection of basis functions (specific to the underlying dynamics you want to learn) is crucial for the performance. This means you need to have some prior knowledge on the form of the equation anyway!\n\n3. Ben-David et al. 2010 has presented some error bounds for the hypothesis that is trained on source data but tested on the target data. I wonder if your EQL model can achieve better error bounds?\n\n4.

Every equation one would like to learn lives in a context, which suggests suitable base functions. In the manuscript, this context is physical expressions (in particular classical mechanics), where sin/cos/etc show up naturally. If we aimed \nat a very different field, e.g. quantum field theory, we would certainly need different base functions, but a domain expert would know what these are.\nNote that we do not aim at learning arbitrary or black-box functions, since there is no hope to extrapolate for them. Or put differently, if the network is not equipped with the required base functions it cannot perform the task. \n\nAnswer to 2: We discuss this in the appendix A1: we aim at choosing a model that has a low validation error (i.e. interpolates well) and high sparsity (which indicates we found the correct formula). However, these quantities live on different scales, and we do not want to introduce a trade-off parameter because it would have to be model selected and this cannot be done since we cannot measure extrapolation quality at training time.\nTherefore, we use a rank-based selection (15). Instead of the validation error and sparsity values themselves, we use the ranks of the respective solutions. Ranks are comparable quantities, so we can combine them into a single quantity and select without a tradeoff parameters.\nIn practice, we observe this criterion to work well, its drawback is that we need to produce multiple candidate networks in order to be able to define rankings in the first place.\n\nAnswer to 3: This is a good idea, although as mentioned above without multiplication units it will not extrapolate well as it\ncannot represent the true functions. If we do include multiplications, we essentially recover EQN.\n\nBest regards\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Extrapolation and learning equations", "abstract": "In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a\nsuitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and  outputs.\nIn the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and  generalize results.
