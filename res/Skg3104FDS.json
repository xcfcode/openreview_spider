The goal is to learn an adaptable preconditioning for the task while training. Specifically, they take the gradient of the loss wrt the precondition matrix and update the precondition matrix to decrease the loss. They reparametrize the precondition matrix to ensure it is positive-definite and provide low-rank approximations and they provide cheap approximations for CNNs.\n\nPros:\n- Figure 3 and 4 show promising results on cifar10 with a 9-layer cnn.\n- Figure 4 shows FOP can improve the accuracy for particular hyper-parameters. In cases improving by 2%.\n\nCons:\n- Results on imagnet are not particularly good. The improvement is not significant.\n- Why positive-definite precondition matrix rather than positive-semi-definite?\n- Section 5: why is a degenerate precondition matrix bad? Fisher and Hessian for deep networks can be highly ill-conditioned.\n- Theo 1 seems to have errors. The term M_t in the update rule should show up in the bound on P as an exponential term in the first upper bound.\n- Figure 2: On mnist after 20 epochs the model has not reached 1% test error. Not clear if we can make any conclusions from this figure.\n\nAfter rebuttal:\nI keep my rating as weak reject. I reiterate that results look promising. However, the quality and accuracy of the writing are not acceptable for a paper on optimization. In my original review I only named a few problematic statements. I have to clarify that I do not think fixing only those few is enough.\n\nI am also not convinced about the proof of Theorem 1. Basically, section 6 looks very much like section 5 from Baydin et al. 2018. Even the wording is mostly the same. Theorem 5.1 in Baydin et al. 2018 is based on their update rule in Eq 6 in the form of alpha_t = alpha_{t-1} - beta nabla^T nabla, where alpha does not appear in the second term. However, in this paper, the update rule on line 7 in Algorithm 1 is M_t = M_{t-1} + rho * eps *(.) M_{t-1}, where M_t appears in the second term. Hence, the first bound in Theorem 1 in this paper cannot simply be the same as in Baydin et al. 2018.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper906/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper906/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "ruiwang@uber.com", "janlan@uber.com", "sanyam@uber.com", "tmiconi@uber.com", "yosinski@uber.com", "aditya.rawal@uber.com"], "title": "First-Order Preconditioning via Hypergradient Descent", "authors": ["Ted Moskovitz", "Rui Wang", "Janice Lan", "Sanyam Kapoor", "Thomas Miconi", "Jason Yosinski", "Aditya Rawal"], "pdf": "/pdf/696ce02ead07c34c2a1c7824201a8c814bfe58fe.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a computationally-efficient method for learning a preconditioning matrix for optimization via hypergradient descent.", "abstract": "Standard gradient-descent methods are susceptible to a range of issues that can impede training, such as high correlations and different scaling in parameter space.

We believe we can address the concerns you expressed. In order:\n\n1. \u201cThe novelty and contribution is not clear.\u201d\n          - We apologize for not more carefully highlighting the differences between FOP and previous algorithms in our initial submission, and believe we have done so in the revised draft:\n          - Previous hypergradient methods which learn a preconditioner (Almeida et al. 1998) restricted it to be diagonal only, which amounts to what is effectively a per-parameter learning rate. FOP learns a matrix with off-diagonal values as well, inducing both scaling and rotation on the gradient.\n          - No previous method has used hypergradients to learn a preconditioning matrix in deep neural networks.\n          - Learning a spatial-only preconditioner for CNNs is, to the best of our knowledge, also novel.\n          - Previous preconditioning methods for deep networks try to approximate specific preconditioners--either the inverse Hessian or inverse Fisher matrix. FOP isn\u2019t learning an approximation to a specific matrix, it simply uses the hypergradient of the loss to directly learn an arbitrary linear transformation of the gradient to accelerate training.\n          - FOP is much more efficient than previous preconditioning methods in deep networks--we believe this is not only such method to be successfully applied to large models trained on ImageNet, but also the first hypergradient method to do so as well. \n          - Our results indicate that the contribution of these changes is an efficient, scalable preconditioner for deep networks that accelerates training and often produces higher generalization performance (Figure 3) in addition to improving the robustness of existing optimizers to hyperparameter selection (Figure 4). \n\n2. \u201cThe ideas of approximating the preconditioning matrix or factorized approximate inverse have been well studied in the literature, which are not sufficiently cited in the paper, such as Adagrad (Duchi et al. 2011), review in Bottou et al. 2016, etc.\u201d\n           - We appreciate these additional citations and have added them to our related work section! However, we also would like once again to stress that FOP isn\u2019t trying to \u2018approximate\u2019 anything--this is one of the method\u2019s main sources of novelty. Rather, it is learning an arbitrary transformation online directly from the loss. In particular, we place no constraint enforcing invertibility of the learned preconditioner (see Sections 2.1 and Section 5), which further lightens the computational load relative to other methods. \n\n3. \u201cDerivation of Eq.(4) seems to be missing.\u201d\n           - Eq. (4) follows directly via the application of the chain rule (Eq. (3)) to Eq. (2), however, we see that this could be confusing, and will include the derivation in the appendix! \n\n4. \u201cTypo errors such as \u201cis can\u201d in page 5.\u201d\n           - Thank you for pointing this out!

We believe we can address your concerns:\n\n1. \u201cResults on imagnet are not particularly good. The improvement is not significant.\u201d\n      - We acknowledge that the final difference in test performance is not large (though, as you note, FOP does produce an improvement). However, with any optimizer, accelerated convergence is another axis of potential improvement, and FOP improves upon previous methods (Figure 3) in this regard. We note Zhang et al. (2019) [1] as an example of another optimizer for deep networks whose improvement in generalization is modest in some cases but which reliably accelerates convergence. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first application of any hypergradient method to deep DNNs on IMageNet, and we believe that showing such methods can be computationally tractable (and even fairly cheap) at ImageNet scale is an important result in its own right.\n\n2. \u201cWhy positive-definite precondition matrix rather than positive-semi-definite?\u201d\n      - Good question! We should have been more clear. We do not constrain the preconditioner to be positive definite, rather than positive semi-definite. In practice, however, the eigenvalues may be small in magnitude, but are never exactly zero, so the preconditioner is always technically positive definite. Also, a positive definite matrix is generally preferable, as that way no information in the gradient is lost via preconditioning. \n\n3. \u201cSection 5: why is a degenerate precondition matrix bad? Fisher and Hessian for deep networks can be highly ill-conditioned.\u201d\n      - Apologies for the confusion! We don\u2019t say that we think a degenerate preconditioner is bad, we simply note that it is interesting that the eigenvalues are low enough to render the matrix effectively non-invertible given that  invertibility of the Hessian/Fisher matrices is required for quasi-Newton/natural gradient methods. We believe we have clarified this point.\n\n4. \u201cTheo 1 seems to have errors. The term M_t in the update rule should show up in the bound on P as an exponential term in the first upper bound.\u201d\n      - Again, apologies for the confusion! Here, we are considering the preconditioning matrix P = MM^T as a whole, not the factorization into M, so M does appear in the bound on the norm of P implicitly. Can you clarify why you believe the first bound should be exponential?\n\n5. \u201cFigure 2: On mnist after 20 epochs the model has not reached 1% test error. Not clear if we can make any conclusions from this figure.\u201d \n      - Our goal with this figure was to demonstrate the relative performance of FOP for differently-ranked preconditioners in a simple fully-connected network. We do not expect such a fully-connected network to quickly reach 1% test error. While more powerful networks can reach 1% very quickly, doing so even with suboptimal optimizers.\n\nThank you once again for your helpful comments, and let us know if we can do anything else to further address your concerns! \n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08610 "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper906/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper906/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "ruiwang@uber.com", "janlan@uber.com", "sanyam@uber.com", "tmiconi@uber.com", "yosinski@uber.com", "aditya.rawal@uber.com"], "title": "First-Order Preconditioning via Hypergradient Descent", "authors": ["Ted Moskovitz", "Rui Wang", "Janice Lan", "Sanyam Kapoor", "Thomas Miconi", "Jason Yosinski", "Aditya Rawal"], "pdf": "/pdf/696ce02ead07c34c2a1c7824201a8c814bfe58fe.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a computationally-efficient method for learning a preconditioning matrix for optimization via hypergradient descent.", "abstract": "Standard gradient-descent methods are susceptible to a range of issues that can impede training, such as high correlations and different scaling in parameter space.

We\u2019d also like to clarify that part of FOP\u2019s novelty is that it doesn\u2019t in any way attempt to approximate the Hessian--it learns an arbitrary linear transformation of the gradient directly from the task loss. We believe we can address your concerns:\n\n1. \u201cSection 2.1 says \u201cwe follow the example of Almeida et al. (1998) and assume that J does not dramatically\u201d. However, the goal of FOP is to encourage J reduce faster. Is there any conflict?\u201d \n      - This is a good question! Almeida et al. are simply assuming that the objective function is relatively smooth. We make the same assumption, with the simple goal of moving along this smooth surface in fewer steps compared to other algorithms--these features are complementary to one another. We will certainly clarify our language on this point!\n\n2. \u201cIn low-rank FOP, the initial preconditioner P contains the term I_m which does not exist in standard FOP (section 2.1). How does this term affect the update procedure? Can you provide some details?\u201d\n      - Good question! I_m is introduced to encourage a more diagonal preconditioner in early training, so that FOP approximates SGD while the preconditioner is first adapting from its initialization. It effectively decomposes the update into an isotropic scaling of the gradient (multiplication by I_m x the learning rate) and a rotation (multiplication by MM^T). We will add these details to the paper!\n\n3. \u201cTheorem 2 provide a linear convergence of FOP under convex, Lipschitz and PL condition. The proof relaxes the preconditioner P into its minimum and maximum eigenvalues. Since P changes over the course of training, it is difficult to check weather the result of Theorem 2 is stronger than gradient descent method.\u201d\n      - Thank you for noting this! The goal of Theorem 2 isn\u2019t to prove that FOP converges more quickly than standard gradient descent (that we leave to future work), but rather simply that the algorithm is still guaranteed to converge even with an arbitrary preconditioner. We also note at the end of the proof that P changing does not affect the proof itself, it simply implies that the step-size must be adaptive to maintain the guarantee of convergence. We refer to Karimi et al. (2016) [1] for further details. \n\n4. \u201cWhy the experimental results not include the other second order optimization algorithms such as K-FAC and KFC?\u201d\n      - Good question! We\u2019d like to note that FOP is not a second-order method--it utilizes only first-order information. This is one of the primary distinctions between FOP and previous preconditioning methods like K-FAC and KFC, in addition to learning an arbitrary preconditioner directly from the loss. Therefore, we found it more appropriate to compare FOP to other adaptive first-order hypergradient methods. To get a sense of the comparison to K-FAC and KFC on CIFAR-10, for example, we recommend viewing Figure 3 of the KFC paper. Importantly, FOP maintains its performance advantage over SGD at convergence, while SGD eventually overtakes KFC. FOP\u2019s efficiency also enables to scale more easily to larger problems like ImageNet.  \n\n5. \u201cThe notations M in (1) (2) and (5) are ambiguous. It is prefer to use another letter to present the preconditioner in (1).\u201d\n      - This is a very good point! We agree, and will change M to P in Eq. 1, as well as note that we set P = MM^T for Eq. 2. \n\nThank you very much once again for helping us to improve our paper, and let us know if there\u2019s anything else we can do to address your concerns! If you have any follow-up thoughts or questions, we'll be happy to reply again.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04636\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper906/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper906/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["thmoskovitz@gmail.com", "ruiwang@uber.com", "janlan@uber.com", "sanyam@uber.com", "tmiconi@uber.com", "yosinski@uber.com", "aditya.rawal@uber.com"], "title": "First-Order Preconditioning via Hypergradient Descent", "authors": ["Ted Moskovitz", "Rui Wang", "Janice Lan", "Sanyam Kapoor", "Thomas Miconi", "Jason Yosinski", "Aditya Rawal"], "pdf": "/pdf/696ce02ead07c34c2a1c7824201a8c814bfe58fe.pdf", "TL;DR": "We introduce a computationally-efficient method for learning a preconditioning matrix for optimization via hypergradient descent.", "abstract": "Standard gradient-descent methods are susceptible to a range of issues that can impede training, such as high correlations and different scaling in parameter space.

The empirical studies on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectives of the proposed algorithms.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n1. Section 2.1 says \u201cwe follow the example of Almeida et al. (1998) and assume that J does not dramatically\u201d. However, the goal of FOP is to encourage J reduce faster. Is there any conflict?\n\n2. In low-rank FOP, the initial preconditioner P contains the term I_m which does not exist in standard FOP (section 2.1). How does this term affect the update procedure? Can you provide some details?\n\n3. Theorem 2 provide a linear convergence of FOP under convex, Lipschitz and PL condition. The proof relaxes the preconditioner P into its minimum and maximum eigenvalues. Since P changes over the course of training, it is difficult to check weather the result of Theorem 2 is stronger than gradient descent method.\n\n4.
