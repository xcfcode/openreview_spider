The paper does this by computing the state-action pair distribution of high rewarding trajectories in the replay buffer, and using a surrogate reward that measures the distance between this distribution and the current state-action pair distribution. The paper derives approximate policy gradients for this surrogate reward function. The paper then describes limitations of doing this: possibility of getting stuck in the local neighborhood of currently well-performing trajectories. It also describes an extension based on Stein variational policy gradients to diversify behavior of an ensemble of policies that are learned together. The paper shows experimental results on a number of MuJoCo tasks.\n\nStrengths:\n1. Adequately leveraging high-return roll-outs for effective learning of policies is an important problem in RL. The paper proposes and empirically investigates a reasonable approach for doing this. The paper shows how using the proposed additional rewards leads to better performance on the choses benchmarks than baseline methods without the proposed rewards.\n\n2. I also like that the paper details the short-comings of the proposed approach, and how these could be fixed.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper uses sparse rewards in RL as a motivation. However, the proposed approach crucially relies on the fact that a good trajectory has at least been encountered once in the past to be of any use. I am not sure if how the proposed approach does justice to the motivation in the paper. The paper should re-write the motivation, or better explain why the proposed method addresses the motivation.\n\n2. Additionally, the paper does not provide adequate experimental validation. The experiment that I think will make the case for the paper is one that shows the sample efficiency of the proposed approach over other baseline methods, when given a successful past roll-out. The current experimental setup emphasizes the sparse reward scenario in RL, and it is just not clear to me as to why this is a good benchmark to study the effects of the proposed method. \n\n3. The paper primarily makes comparisons to on-policy methods. This may not be a fair comparison, as the proposed method uses past trajectories from a replay buffer (to compute reward). Perhaps improvements are coming because of use of this off-policy information. The paper should design experiments to de-conflate this: perhaps by also comparing to how these additional rewards will compare in context of off-policy methods (like Q-learning).\n\n4. I also do not understand how the benchmark tasks were chosen? Are the MuJoCo tasks studied here a fair representative of MuJoCo tasks studied in literature, or are these selected in any manner? While selecting and modifying benchmarks for the purpose of making a specific point is acceptable, it is important to include benchmark results on a full suite of tasks. This can help understand (desirable or un-desirable) side-effects of proposed ideas.\n\nAfter reading author response and the extra experiments, I have changed my rating to 6 (from the original rating of 5).", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper872/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Self-Imitating Diverse Policies", "abstract": "The success of popular algorithms for deep reinforcement learning, such as policy-gradients and Q-learning, relies heavily on the availability of an informative reward signal at each timestep of the sequential decision-making process.

This would fall under the limitations of self-imitation which we discuss in the paper; we could rely on population-based exploration methods (e.g. SVPG, Section 2.3) and draw on the rich literature on single-agent exploration methods like curiosity/novelty-search or parameter noise to alleviate this to an extent. Instead, we focus on scenarios where \u201csparse\u201d feedback is available within an episode. We will make this very clear in our revision. For example, our experiments in Section 3.1 consider tasks where some feedback is available in an episode - either only once at the end of the episode, or at very few timesteps during an episode. We find self-imitation to be highly beneficial (compared to standard policy gradients) on these \u201csparse\u201d constructions. Some practical situations of the kind include a.) robotics tasks where rewards in an episode could be intermittent or delayed by arbitrary timesteps due to the inverse kinematics operations b.) cases where a mild feedback on the overall quality of the episode is available, but designing a dense reward function manually is prohibitively hard; an interesting example of this is [5].\n\nAlso, although our algorithm exploits \u201cgood\u201d trajectories from agent\u2019s past experience, the demands on the \u201cgoodness\u201d of the trajectories are very relaxed. Indeed, the trajectories imitated during the initial phases of learning have quite low overall scores, and they gradually improve in quality.\n\n[5] Christiano, Paul F., et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\n\n2- Concerning \u201cPoint 3. under Weaknesses -- comparison to off-policy RL methods\u201d:\n\nOur approach makes use of a replay memory to store and exploit past good rollouts of the agent. Off-policy RL methods such as DQN, DDPG also accumulate agent experience in a replay buffer and reuse them for learning (e.g. by reducing TD-error). We run new experiments with a recent off-policy RL method based on DDPG - Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3; [2]). Appendix 5.10 evaluates its performance on MuJoCo tasks under the various reward distributions we used in our paper. We find that the performance of TD3 suffers appreciably under the episodic case and when the rewards are masked out with 90% probability (p_m=0.9). We therefore believe that popular off-policy algorithms (DDPG, TD3) do not exploit the past experience in a manner that accelerates learning when rewards are scarce during an episode. The per-timestep (dense) pseudo-rewards that we obtain with the divergence-minimization objective help in temporal credit assignment, resulting in good policies even under the episodic and noisy (p_m=0.9) settings (Table 1, Section 3.1).\n\n[2] Fujimoto, Scott, Herke van Hoof, and Dave Meger. \"Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2018.\n\n\n4- Concerning \u201cPoint 4. under Weaknesses \u201d: \n\nWe have added Appendix 5.7 with results on more MuJoCo tasks.

(Part 2/2)", "comment": "\n6- Concerning \u201cHow is the priority list threshold and size chosen?\u201d: \n\nOur implementation stores the top-C trajectories in the priority queue based on cumulative trajectory-return. We fix the capacity (C) to 10 trajectories for all our experiments. This number was chosen after a limited hyperparameter grid search on Humanoid and Hopper (Appendix 5.4). In general, we didn\u2019t find our method to be particularly sensitive to the choice of C.\n\n\n7- Concerning \u201cWould a softer version of the priority queue update do anything useful?\u201d:\n\nIn our initial experiments, we tested with using more relaxed update rules for the priory queue, but found that storing the overall top-C trajectories gave the best results. Nonetheless, the various options for storing and reusing past experiences present interesting trade-offs, and we hope to look deeper into this in the future.\n\n\n8- Concerning \u201cThe update in (3) seems quite similar to what GAIL would do. What is the difference there?\u201d: \n\nYes, as we mention in the derivation (Appendix 5.1), GAIL does a similar update, but using external expert trajectories rather than using self-imitation. An implementation-specific difference is that while GAIL uses discriminator networks to implicitly estimate the ratio required in the policy gradient theorem, we (when using SVPG exploration in Algorithm 2) learn separate state-action density estimation networks (psi), and explicitly compute the required ratios. This is done for reasons of computational efficiency (Appendix 5.8.2). \n \n\n9- Concerning \u201cwhy higher asymptotic performance but is often slower in the beginning than the other methods in Fig 3\u201d: \n\nConsider SparseHopper as an example. There is a local minima where the agent can stand still (i.e. no hopping) and collect the per-timestep survival bonus given for not falling down. Baseline algorithms such as PPO-Independent or SI-independent quickly get into this local minima since they greedily exploit the survival bonus readily available. Hence, they reach a score of ~1000 quickly. In, SI-Interact-JS, however, the JS repulsion forces the agents to be diverse and explore the state-space much more effectively. The highest scoring agent in this ensemble (which is plotted in Figure 3.) discovers the hopping behavior eventually. However, during its learning lifetime, it takes varied actions to reach states different from other agents, due to JS repulsion. The score grows gradually since many of the attempts in the beginning lead to the agent falling down (and therefore episode termination) in the process of trying something different. The agent does not quickly accumulate the survival bonus and stand still, unlike the baselines. The asymptotic score is higher since the forward hopping is rewarded higher compared to the survival bonus.

(Part 1/2)", "comment": "\n1- Concerning \u201cWhy is self-imitation more effective than standard policy gradients, and if the source of stability can be explained intuitively\u201d : \n\nWe believe that learning pseudo-rewards with self-imitation helps in the temporal credit assignment problem in the sparse- or episodic-reward setting. For instance, in the episodic setting, where a reward is only provided at episode termination, standard policy gradient algorithms reinforce the actions towards the beginning of the episode based on a reward signal which is obtained after multiple timesteps and convolves the effect of many intermediate actions. This signal is potentially sparse and diluted, and may deteriorate with task horizon. With our approach, since we learn \u201cper-timestep\u201d pseudo-rewards with self-imitation, we expect this greedy signal to help in attributing credit to actions more effectively, leading to faster training.\n\nQualitatively, the stability of the self-imitation algorithm could also be understood by viewing it as a form of curriculum learning [4]. Unlike learning from perfect demonstrations by external experts, our learner at any point in time is imitating only a slightly different version of itself. The demonstrations, therefore, increase in complexity gradually over time, resulting in an implicit, adaptive curriculum which stabilizes learning and avoids catastrophic forgetting of behaviors. \n\n[4] Bengio, Yoshua, et al. \"Curriculum learning.\" Proceedings of the 26th annual international conference on machine learning.

We have also added the missing reference to Guided Policy Search and expanded on GAIL. DIAYN (Eysenbach et al 2018) is included in Appendix 5.6.\n\n\n3- Concerning \u201cComparison to Oh et al. (2018)\u201d: \n\nWe have added a new section (Appendix 5.9) focussed on the algorithm (SIL) by Oh et al. (2018). Therein, we mention the update rule for SIL and the performance of PPO+SIL on MuJoCo tasks under the various reward distributions we used in our paper. We summarize our observations here (please see Appendix 5.9 for more details). The performance of PPO+SIL suffers under the episodic case and when the rewards are masked out with 90% probability (p_m=0.9). Our intuition is that this is because PPO+SIL makes use of the \u201ccumulative return\u201d from each transition of a past good rollout for the update. When rewards are provided only at the end of the episode, for instance, cumulative return does not help with the temporal credit assignment problem and hence is not a strong learning signal. \n\n\n4- Concerning \u201cComparing SVPG exploration (Figure 3) to novelty/curiosity based exploration schemes\u201d: \n\nWe have added a new section (Appendix 5.11) on comparing SVPG exploration to a novelty-based exploration baseline - EX2 [3]. The EX2 algorithm does implicit density estimation using discriminative modeling, and uses it for novelty-based exploration. We report results on the hard exploration MuJoCo tasks considered in Section 3.2, using author provided code and hyperparameters. Table 5 in Appendix 5.11 shows that we compare favorably against EX2 on the tasks evaluated. \n\n[3] Fu, Justin, John Co-Reyes, and Sergey Levine. \"Ex2: Exploration with exemplar models for deep reinforcement learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\n\n5- Concerning \u201cWhat is psi in appendix 5.3? \u201d: \n\nWe apologize for skimping the details on this. \u201cpsi\u201d denotes the parameters of neural networks that are used to model the state-action visitation distribution (rho) of the policy. Therefore, for an ensemble of n policies, there are n \u201cpsi\u201d networks. The motivation behind using these networks is as follows. To calculate the gradient of JS, we need the ratio denoted by r^{\\phi} in the paper. This ratio can be obtained implicitly by training a parameterized discriminator network. However, when using SVPG exploration with JS kernel, this method would require us to train O(n^2) discriminator networks, one each for calculating the gradient of JS between a policy pair (i,j). To reduce the computational and memory resource burden to O(n), we opt for explicit modeling of the state-action visitation distribution (rho) of the policy by a network with parameters \u201cpsi\u201d. The \u201cpsi\u201d networks are trained using the JS optimization (Equation 2.) and we can then obtain the ratio explicitly from these \u201cpsi\u201d networks.

The resulting training procedure is a policy gradient that gets additional reinforcement of the system's best runs.\n\nThe experiments show the validity especially for the most extreme case (episodic rewards), while, as expected, for the other extreme of dense rewards, the method's effect is not consistently positive.\n\nThe paper then critiques its own method and identifies a critical weakness: the reliance on good exploration. I like that a lot. The paper goes on to suggest an extension to address this by training an ensemble, and shows the effectiveness of this for a number of tasks. However, I feel that the description of this extension is less clear than that of the core idea, and introduces too many new ideas and concepts in a too condensed text.\n\nThe paper seems a significant in that it provides a notable improvement for sparse-rewards tasks, which are a common sub-class of real-world problems.\n\nMy background is not RL. While I am quite confident in my understanding of the paper's math, I am not 100% familiar with the typical benchmark sets. Hence, I cannot judge whether the results include good baselines, or whether the task selection is biased. I can also not judge the completeness of the related work, and how novel the work is. For these questions, I hope that the other reviewers can provide more information.\n\nPros:\n - intuitive idea for a common problem\n - solution elegantly has the form of a modified policy gradient\n - convincing experimental results\n - self-critique of core idea, and extension to address its main weakness\n - nicely written text, does not leave a lot of questions\n\nCons:\n - while the core idea is nicely motivated and described and good to follow, Section 2.3 feels very dense and too short.\n\nOverall, I find the core idea quite intuitive and elegant. The paper's background, motivation, and core method are well-written and, with some effort, quite readable for someone who is not an RL expert. I found that several questions I had during reading were preempted promptly and addressed. However, the description of the secondary method (Section 2.3) is too dense.\n\nTo me, the paper solidly meets the threshold of publication. Since I have no good comparison to other papers, I rate it a \"clear accept\" (8).\n\nMinor points:\n\nI noticed a few superfluous \"the\", please double-check.\n\nIn Table 1, please use the same exponent for directly comparable numbers, e.g. instead of \"1.8e5 4.4e4\", say \"18e4 4.4e4\". Or best just print the full numbers without exponent, I think you have the space.\n\nWhen reading Table 1, I could bnot immediately line up \"PPO\" and \"Self-imitation\" in the caption with the table columns. It took a while to infer that PPO refers to \\nu=0, and SI to \\nu=0.8. Can you add PPO and SI to the table headings?\n\nYou define p as \"the masking probability\", but it is not clear whether that is the probability for keeping a \"1\" in the mask,\nor for masking out the value. I can only guess from the results. I suggest to rephrase as \"the probability of retaining a reward\". Also, how about using plain words in Table 1's heading, such as \"Noisy rewards\\nSuppressing 10% of rewards\", so that one can understand the table without having to search for its description in the text?\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper872/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Self-Imitating Diverse Policies", "abstract": "The success of popular algorithms for deep reinforcement learning, such as policy-gradients and Q-learning, relies heavily on the availability of an informative reward signal at each timestep of the sequential decision-making process.

One thing I\u2019d have liked to see a bit more is an explanation of why self imitation is more effective than standard policy gradient? Where does the extra supervision/stability come from, and can this be explained intuitively? I\u2019ve suggested some small changes/clarifications to be made inline, and a few more comparisons to add. But overall, I very much like this line of work and I recommend accepting this paper. \n\n\nAbstract:\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of challenging tasks. -> be more specific.\n\nThe term single-timestep optimization is not very clear. Can this be clarified?\n\nthey are more widely applicable in the sparse or episodic reward settings -> it is likely important to mention that they are agnostic to horizon of the task.\n\nRelated works: \nGuided Policy Search also does divergence minimization. GAIL considers the imitation learning work as a sort of divergence minimization problem as well, which should be explicitly mentioned. Other work for good exploration include DIAYN (Eysenbach et al 2018). The difference in resulting updates between (Oh et al) and this work should be clearly discussed in the methods section. \n\n\u201cwe learn shaped, dense rewards\u201d-> too early in the paper for this to make sense. can provide some contextt\n\nSection 2.2:\nfully decides the expected return -> clarify this a bit. I think what you mean is that the dynamics are wrapped into this already, so it accounts for this, but this can be made explicit.\n\nSmall typos in appendix 5.1 (r should be replaced by the density ratio)\n\nThe update in (3) seems quite similar to what GAIL would do. What is the difference there? Or is the difference just in the fact that the experts are chosen from \u201cself\u201d experiences. \n\nHow is the priority list threshold and size chosen?\n\u2028Would a softer version of the priority queue update do anything useful? Or would it just reduce to policy gradient when weighted by rewards?\n\nAppendices are very clear and very informative while being succinct!\n\nI would have liked to see Appendix 5.3 in the main text (maybe a shorter form) to clarify the whole algorithm \n\nWhat is psi in appendix 5.3? The algorithm remains a bit unclear without this clarification\n\nExperiments. \nOnly 1 question to answer in this section is labelled? Put 2) and 3) appropriately. \n\nCan a comparison to Oh et al 2018 be added to this for the sake of completeness? Also can this be compared to using novelty/curiosity based exploration schemes?\n\nCan the authors comment on why the method reaches higher asymptotic performance but is often slower in the beginning than the other methods in Fig 3.

When rewards are only sparsely available during an episode, or a rewarding feedback is provided only after episode termination, these algorithms perform sub-optimally due to the difficultly in credit assignment. Alternatively, trajectory-based policy optimization methods, such as cross-entropy method and evolution strategies, do not require per-timestep rewards, but have been found to suffer from high sample complexity by completing forgoing the temporal nature of the problem. Improving the efficiency of RL algorithms in real-world problems with sparse or episodic rewards is therefore a pressing need. In this work, we introduce a self-imitation learning algorithm that exploits and explores well in the sparse and episodic reward settings. We view each policy as a state-action visitation distribution and formulate policy optimization as a divergence minimization problem. We show that with Jensen-Shannon divergence, this divergence minimization problem can be reduced into a policy-gradient algorithm with shaped rewards learned from experience replays. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm works comparable to existing algorithms in environments with dense rewards, and significantly better in environments with sparse and episodic rewards.
