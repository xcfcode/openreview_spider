It's not clear what kind of loss function is really being optimised here. It feels like it should be the same, but the tweaks applied to fix weights across all samples for a class doesn't make it not clear what is that really gets optimised at the end.\n- While the motivation is that classes have different complexities to learn and hence you might want each base model to focus on different classes, it is not clear why this methods should be better than normal boosting: if a class is more difficult, it's expected that their samples will have higher weights and hence the next base model will focus more on them. And crudely speaking, you can think of a class weight to be the expectation of its sample weights and you will end up in a similar setup.\n- Choice of using large CNNs as base models for boosting isn't appealing in practical terms, such models will give you the ability to have only a few iterations and hence you can't achieve any convergence that often is the target of boosting models with many base learners.\n- Experimentally, paper would benefit with better comparisons and studies: 1) state-of-the-art methods haven't been compared against (e.g. ImageNet experiment compares to 2 years old method) 2) comparisons to using normal AdaBoost on more complex methods haven't been studied (other than the MNIST) 3) comparison to simply ensembling with random initialisations.\n\nOther comments:\n- Paper would benefit from writing improvements to make it read better.\n- \"simply use the weighted error function\": I don't think this is correct, AdaBoost loss function is an exponential loss.

Individual points are addressed below. \n\n-The objective function of our algorithm is the weighted margin between the average correct classification probability and the average incorrect classification probability, as in Eq.(3) and Eq.(4). The first term of Eq.(4) is just the likelihood of positive samples. So, the loss can be seen as the opposite number of objective function Eq.(3). Maximizing the margin in Eq.(3) is equivalent to minimizing the loss. To update the weight distribution for different categories, we employ an exponential updating rule as in Eq.(7), which encourages focusing on the categories that are hard to classify.\n\n-For large-scale visual recognition, it is worth noting that every object class may contain large numbers of hard images due to huge intra-class visual diversity, thus weighting the sample errors may not be able to achieve the same effects as weighting the object classes according to their learning complexities, e.g., weighting the sample errors may not be able to improve the accuracy rates for the hard object classes. Because large numbers of object classes may have different learning complexities, the errors from the hard object classes and the easy ones may have significantly different effects on optimizing their joint objective function. Therefore, it is very attractive to invest new boosting algorithms that can train the deep networks for the hard object classes and the easy ones sequentially in an easy-to-hard way, such that the ensemble network can improve the accuracy rates for the hard object classes at certain degrees while effectively maintaining high accuracy rates for the easy ones.\n\n-Because large numbers of object classes may have different learning complexities, the sample errors from the hard object classes and the easy ones may have significantly different roles in optimizing their joint objective function on learning their joint deep network. Unfortunately, for large-scale visual recognition (i.e., recognizing large numbers of object classes), weighting the sample errors individually (like traditional deep boosting approaches) may not be able to achieve the same effects as weighting the object classes directly according to their learning complexities, e.g., treating the sample errors from the hard object classes and the easy ones to be equally important may easily distract their joint deep network on achieving higher accuracy rates on recognizing the easy object classes but paying less attentions on correcting the sample errors from the hard object classes. Therefore, it is very attractive to invest new boosting algorithms that can train the deep networks for the hard object classes and the easy ones sequentially in an easy-to-hard way, such that the ensemble network can improve the accuracy rates for the hard object classes at certain degrees while effectively maintaining high accuracy rates for the easy ones."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Boosting of Diverse Experts", "abstract": "In this paper, a deep boosting algorithm is developed to\nlearn more discriminative ensemble classifier by seamlessly combining a set of base deep CNNs (base experts)\nwith diverse capabilities, e.g., these base deep CNNs are\nsequentially trained to recognize a set of \nobject classes in an easy-to-hard way according to their\nlearning complexities.

Individual points are addressed below. \n-In Eq. (3), \\tilde{D} is not defined.\nA:As described in the paragraph below Eq. (4),  \\tilde{D}_t(l) is the normalized importance score for class l in the tth base expert. Its initial value is 1/C. Then it will be updated iteratively as in Eq. (9).\n-Under the assumption $\\epsilon_t(l) > \\frac{1}{2\\lambda}$, the definition of $\\beta_t$ in Eq.8 does not satisfy $0 < \\beta_t < 1$. \nA:In Section 3.3, we discuss the selection of $\\lambda$.   In the case $\\epsilon_t(l) > \\frac{1}{2\\lambda}$\uff0cit means that the l-th category is the hard category, and we decrease the hyper-parameter $\\lambda$ such that $0 < \\beta_t < 1$ holds.\n- How many layers is the DenseNet-BC used in this paper? Why the error rate reported here is higher than that in the original paper? \nA: A 100-layer DenseNet-BC model is used in this paper on CIFAR100 which is the same in the original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf). The reason why the error rate here is higher is mainly due to that we do not use all 50,000 samples on training split and validation split at the final run, which is the training trick reported in the original paper. As mentioned in our paper, we only use the validation split for the update of the weights in the following iteration. Another minor factor may be that we only train the model once in the first iteration and do not run many times for selection of the best model since we care more about the effects of our boosting algorithm.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Boosting of Diverse Experts", "abstract": "In this paper, a deep boosting algorithm is developed to\nlearn more discriminative ensemble classifier by seamlessly combining a set of base deep CNNs (base experts)\nwith diverse capabilities, e.g., these base deep CNNs are\nsequentially trained to recognize a set of \nobject classes in an easy-to-hard way according to their\nlearning complexities.
