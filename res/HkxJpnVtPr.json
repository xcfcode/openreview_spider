This is a borderline paper and has been carefully discussed. The main concern of the reviewers is that this paper falls short of proper experiment evaluation to support their theoretical analysis. In detail, the authors proved a globally sublinear convergence rate to a local minimum, yet the experiments demonstrate a linear or even quadratic convergence starting from the initialization. There is a big gap between the theoretical analysis and experiments, which is probably due to the experimental design. In addition, the authors did not submit a revision during the author response (while it is optional), so it is unclear whether a major revision is required to address all the reviewers\u2019 comments. In fact, one reviewer thinks that a major revision is needed. I agree with the reviewers\u2019 evaluation and encourage the authors to improve this paper before future submission.", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Stochastic Trust Region Method for Non-convex Minimization", "authors": ["Zebang Shen", "Pan Zhou", "Cong Fang", "Jiahao Xie", "Alejandro Ribeiro"], "authorids": ["shenzebang@zju.edu.cn", "pzhou@u.nus.edu", "fangcong@pku.edu.cn", "xiejh@zju.edu.cn", "aribeiro@seas.upenn.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We target the problem of finding a local minimum in non-convex finite-sum minimization.

For $k mod p \\neq 0$, we have used the induction approach in the rebuttal to show $E[g^k] = \\nabla F(x^k)$ in terms of all previous iterations. So the gradient estimator is unbiased in the sense of total expectation on the algorithm. Actually, taking the expectation on the whole previous iterations is natural and reasonable. Firstly, the convergence results of stochastic optimization works, e.g. SGD (Ghadimi & Lan, 2013 SIAM Optimization), are usually obtained on the conditions of all algorithm iterations. Moreover, this unbias is consistent with other classical stochastic optimization works, such as SVRG (Johnson et al, NeurIPS'13), SPIDER (Fang et al, NeurIPS'18), SVRC (Zhou et al. ICML'18), which all show  unbiased gradient or Hessian estimators in terms of all the previous iterations and then prove their convergence results. Finally, this kind of unbias is weaker than the unbiasedness conditioned on the current iterate $x^k$, but it is sufficient to obtain the convergence results in the manuscript."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Stochastic Trust Region Method for Non-convex Minimization", "authors": ["Zebang Shen", "Pan Zhou", "Cong Fang", "Jiahao Xie", "Alejandro Ribeiro"], "authorids": ["shenzebang@zju.edu.cn", "pzhou@u.nus.edu", "fangcong@pku.edu.cn", "xiejh@zju.edu.cn", "aribeiro@seas.upenn.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We target the problem of finding a local minimum in non-convex finite-sum minimization.

Taking the gradient estimator as an example. Clearly $g^{0}$ is unbiased. Suppose $E[g^{k-1}]=\\nabla F(x^{k-1})$ is unbiased. Then we have $E[g^{k}] = E[g^{k-1}] + E[\\nabla f(x^{k}; G) - \\nabla f(x^{k-1}; G)] = \\nabla F(x^{k-1}) + \\nabla F(x^{k}) - \\nabla F(x^{k-1}) = \\nabla F(x^{k})$, meaning the gradient estimation is unbiased.\n\n2. trust region size:\nThere are two reasons that our variance-reduced STR algorithms outperform trust region (TR) methods. First, the faster speed of our STR contributes to its gradient and Hessian estimators. These two estimators only require a small minibatch of samples to estimate very accurate gradient and Hessian. In contrast, TR needs to access the whole dataset which is time-consuming, especially for large-scale datasets. So our STR has much lower algorithm running time and Hessian sample complexity over TR at each iteration. Moreover, in the experiments, we use a loose TR size to achieve satisfactory performance. This is because a loose TR size constraint allows the algorithm to select a more proper stepsize for fast decreasing the objective according to the current landscape of the problem. Compared with adaptive stepsize in TR which computes the objective several times with substantial computational time especially for high-dimensional problems, this fixed stepsize strategy may not be as good as the adaptive stepsize strategy but it does not increase any computational cost. Since for second-order algorithms, computing their Hessian and gradient dominates the main computational cost, our STR outperforms TR method.\n\n3. space complexity\nFor non-Hessian-free algorithms in Table 1, such as TR, CR and our STR, they all need to explicitly compute the Hessian matrix. So their memory cost is $O(d^2)$. To alleviate such cost, we propose a Hessian-free variant, i.e. STR_{free} in Algorithm 8, which only requires Hessian-vector products. So the memory cost is $O(d)$. For this, we have discussed our algorithms and other baselines in the third paragraph in Sec. 7.\n\n4. high probability convergence\nWe acknowledge that a very small failure probability $\\delta$ would introduce a marginal cost ($log 1/\\delta$) to the overall complexity. However, the dependence on the failure probability $\\delta$ is ubiquitous in all stochastic algorithms with high probability convergence. Importantly, our results compared to deterministic methods enjoy a polynomial reduction to the dependence on the number $n$ of component function, at the cost of a minor logarithmic dependence on $1/\\delta$. For example, the $O(n/\\epsilon^{1.5})$ SSO complexity in deterministic Trust Region is reduced to $O(\\log(1/\\delta)*\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^{1.5})$ in our Stochastic Trust Region.\n\n5. experiment\nThanks. Our experiments follow the conventional settings in (Kohler et al, ICML'17; Zhou et al, ICML'18), including the optimization problems and parameter settings. One can observe the same phenomenon in these papers. In all experiments, the initialization for all methods are the origin and hence are not close to a minimum. After receiving the comment, we carefully checked the optimization problems on the testing datasets and found that the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix on the ijcnn testing dataset is negative but not very small (at the order of -1e-4). Other than that, the problems on other datasets, e.g. phishing and w08, are strongly non-convex.

Please note that Zhou & Gu (2019) has updated their arXiv submission during the review period.", "comment": "1. Novelty:\nOur novelty is two-folded. Firstly, for the first time, we prove the vanilla trust region method (MetaAlgorithm 1) can achieve the optimal convergence rate $O(1/k^{2/3})$, much sharper than the existing one $O(1/k^{1/2})$. Note that prior to our work, to achieve this optimal convergence rate, one needs to develop a very complicated trust region variant with tedious and complex proofs (see Curtis et al, 2017). This is already discussed below Lemma 2.1 of the manuscript and will be highlighted in revision.\n\nThe second novelty is to integrate SPIDER estimator with the trust region method which paves a new way for reducing the Hessian variance (more accurate Hessian estimation) in second-order algorithms. As a result, we improve both the first- and second-order computational complexities of trust region method and achieve state-of-the-art computational cost (see Tables 1 and 2).\n\n2. comparison with Zhou & Gu (2019)\uff1a\nWe note that Zhou & Gu (2019) has updated their arXiv submission during the review period. As a result, our submission can only compare with the first version of Zhou & Gu (2019). \n\nIn the current version, we have compared the results of Zhou & Gu (2019) in Sec. 4.2 and 6.2. For non-Hessian free algorithms in Sec. 4, when we submitted this work, our result is better than theirs under the same assumption: if $1/\\epsilon < n < 1/\\epsilon^2$, our STR1 outperforms SRVRC; otherwise they have the same complexities (see Sec. 4.2). Note for the case where $n > 1/\\epsilon^2$, by further assuming gradient variance is bounded, both methods can achieve the same result. Recently, they improved their algorithm and achieved the same results as ours. As Zhou et al. need to further assume stochastic gradient to be bounded which is absent in ours, for fairness we do not include their result in Table 1. We will mention this difference and then include their results in Table 1 in the revision. For Hessian-free algorithms in Sec. 6, we have compared ours with Zhou & Gu (2019). If $n < 1/\\epsilon^2$, then our result is better than theirs; otherwise, we have the same results (see Table 2 and Sec. E.4) with an extra bounded-gradient-variance assumption. In summary, our results for both non-Hessian-free and Hessian-free settings are as good as or stronger than theirs.\n\nFinally, since this paper focuses on stochastic trust region algorithm while Zhou et al. pay attention to stochastic cubic regularization method, we believe both papers are of their own interest and should not be judged only by their complexities.\n\n\n3. verbose:\nIn our revision, we will simplify our presentation and correct the typos."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Stochastic Trust Region Method for Non-convex Minimization", "authors": ["Zebang Shen", "Pan Zhou", "Cong Fang", "Jiahao Xie", "Alejandro Ribeiro"], "authorids": ["shenzebang@zju.edu.cn", "pzhou@u.nus.edu", "fangcong@pku.edu.cn", "xiejh@zju.edu.cn", "aribeiro@seas.upenn.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We target the problem of finding a local minimum in non-convex finite-sum minimization.

In order to control the difference between gradient and approximation gradient, the author use variance reduced estimator to exploit the correlation between consecutive iterations. In addition, the author consider for two cases with the importance of second-order oracle and use Hessian to improve the approximation of gradient when first-order and second-order oracle are equally important. Furthermore, the authors proposed a refined algorithm in practice which only uses stochastic gradient and Hessian-vector product information and showed better experiment results. \nIn general, the paper is well written and easy to follow, but I still have some questions about this paper.\nFirst, there lacks explanation about why using biased estimators can still guarantee the convergence. For estimator 3 and estimator 4, it seems like that the stochastic gradient and Hessian are not unbiased approximation of the true value. That is a bit strange, since most popular stochastic estimators including stochastic gradient and stochastic variance-reduced gradient are unbiased approximation, which could guarantee that when the number of samples is large enough, the estimators can approximate the true quantities very well.  More discussion about this issue is needed. .\nSecond, to the best of my knowledge, the trust region radius is changing during the iteration for basic trust region algorithm. However, in meta-algorithm 1, the radius is fixed to a very small quantity which is related to the accuracy \\epsilon. I am very surprised that with a fixed small radius, STR can still achieve the best result among all baseline algorithms, especially compared with trust region algorithm with adaptive radius. Can the authors explain this phenomenon? \nThird, there is no discussion on space complexity. In practice, it is important to consider the space complexity. However, this work did not provide any space complexity analysis, especially to compare with first-order algorithms. It is interesting to see the trade-off between space complexity and time complexity among both first-order algorithms and second-order algorithms. \nFourth, the results of Lemma 4.1 and 4.2 are all in high probability. When the probability $\\delta$ is small, then the number of sample is large. Thus, it is not fair that the authors simply ignored them when they compared their algorithms with deterministic algorithm. Furthermore, in practice, to choose small $\\delta$ may cause the total number of samples very big. The authors need to make more comments on this issue. \nFinally, I think the experiment results contradict the theoretical results. From figure 1, it can be seen that the STR method including many other baseline algorithms converge to the global minimum with linear convergence speed (a9a, epoch). However, the convergence analysis provided by the authors claim that the convergence speed is sublinear. I believe such a difference is due to a fact that the initialized parameter is near to the global minimum, thus the optimization landscape here is actually convex but not non-convex.

Indeed, from the proof of theorem 3.1, MetaAlgorithm 1 does not seem to rely on the finite sum setting, which is mostly used for analyzing the variance-reduced estimators. This would be helpful as it would enable MetaAlgorithm 1 to be used with appropriate variance-reduced estimators in settings beyond the finite-sum problems.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Stochastic Trust Region Method for Non-convex Minimization", "authors": ["Zebang Shen", "Pan Zhou", "Cong Fang", "Jiahao Xie", "Alejandro Ribeiro"], "authorids": ["shenzebang@zju.edu.cn", "pzhou@u.nus.edu", "fangcong@pku.edu.cn", "xiejh@zju.edu.cn", "aribeiro@seas.upenn.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We target the problem of finding a local minimum in non-convex finite-sum minimization.

This result improves the SSO of stochastic variance-reduced cubic (SVRC) by a factor of $n^{1/6}$. This paper has a moderate contribution because of the new algorithms and improved complexity results. However, the idea of variance reduction is not novel and the result is not surprising since the improvement comes purely from spider (Fang et al., 2018) and thus this work is somewhat incremental. The paper is in general fairly written without many typos or unclear statements. But some places are verbose and necessarily complicated. Moreover, the comparison between this paper and existing work is not clear and straightforward. Lastly, the presentation of the current paper is unnecessarily verbose and complicated.\n\nThe comparison of this paper with a similar paper by Zhou & Gu (2019) is not convincing. In the remark after Corollary 4.1 and in Section 6.1, the authors mentioned that the SRVRC algorithm proposed by Zhou & Gu (2019) achieves similar complexity as this paper. But the authors did not present the complexity of SRVRC in Table 1. This is not appropriate since it is very similar and related to this paper. The authors should compare with existing work in a more clear and fair way.\n \nIn Remark 3.1 and the discussion after that, the authors argued that the exact step size control is crucial to the sample efficiency of stochastic trust region algorithms. However, the cubic regularization based algorithm in Zhou & Gu (2019) can also achieve the same second order oracle complexity. Therefore, I don\u2019t think the arguments in the two paragraphs after Remark 3.1 are the key reason for the improvement. Instead, the spider estimator that greatly reduces the variance is the key point leading to the improved sample efficiency.\n\nI find the presentation of this paper is very verbose and unnecessarily long (10 pages, 8 algorithm boxes and 8 theorems/lemmas in the main paper). Many places can be simplified or combined in order to increase the readability of the main theorems. Some intermediate results may also be moved to the appendix if necessary.\n\nAlgorithm 2 and 3 are almost identical since the gradient and Hessian estimators ($g^k, H^k$) are represented in the same form. I don\u2019t see the point of repeating the algorithms twice. In the Estimator 3, the two options can be simply combined by setting $s_2\u2019=\\min\\{1/\\epsilon, n\\}$ since according to Lemma 4.1 $s_2\u2019=1/\\epsilon$ in option II. \n\nThe paper talks about $\\epsilon$-SOSP, $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon)$-SOSP, $12\\epsilon$-SOSP and so on in many places. It would be better to be consistent and use the same notation.\n\nIn the text after Corollary 4.1, there are some typos in the complexities where a $\\min$ operator is missing. Moreover, the complexity of Zhou & Gu (2019) presented here seems not correct. I quickly checked their paper and found in their table that the SFO complexity of Zhou & Gu (2019) is $\\tilde{O}(\\min\\{n/\\epsilon^{3/2},n^{1/2}/\\epsilon^2,1/\\epsilon^3\\})$, which is in fact smaller than the complexity of STR1 in this paper. Therefore, I think the comparison in this paragraph is not correct.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper212/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Stochastic Trust Region Method for Non-convex Minimization", "authors": ["Zebang Shen", "Pan Zhou", "Cong Fang", "Jiahao Xie", "Alejandro Ribeiro"], "authorids": ["shenzebang@zju.edu.cn", "pzhou@u.nus.edu", "fangcong@pku.edu.cn", "xiejh@zju.edu.cn", "aribeiro@seas.upenn.edu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We target the problem of finding a local minimum in non-convex finite-sum minimization.
