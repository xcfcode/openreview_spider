The problem of the point cloud generation of Achlioptas et al., (2018) is it can't generate arbitrarily many number of points. This issue has been discussed and addressed in those works ...\n\nA: No, we don\u2019t think so. We also noticed that the method in Achlioptas et al., (2018) cannot generate arbitrarily many number of points. However, this problem is out the range of our work. In this paper we focus on how to simultaneously capture the informative intrinsic structure in the latent space and generate 3D shape in the ambient space. They are totally two different issues in 3D point synthesis.\n\nQ1(2) && Q2:With stronger prior in the generation process is even studied &&The two generator approach is nothing new.  the first generator g_1 is the same as the \"learned prior\". There are many related works...(these two question express the same query so we will answer them together)\n\nA: No, Reviewer#3 has misunderstood the roles of the two generator-discriminator pairs (g_1, d_1) and (g_2, d_2). We don\u2019t employ (g_1, d_1) to learn any prior. It is easily seen that the proposed framework is different greatly than the existing two generator approaches. As mentioned earlier, the proposed framework indeed makes use of (g_1, d_1) to capture the informative intrinsic structure in the low-dimensional tangent space. During training, the two generator-discriminator pairs (g_1, d_1) and (g_2, d_2) are updated alternatively. What\u2019s more, all of the modules in the proposed framework are jointly trained for the end-to-end data synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architecture is new and unique.  \n\nQ(3): The paper is not well written, there are several wrong formats of citations and some typos, especially on math symbols, which hinders the reading.  (e.g. G is undefined in Algorithm 1)\n\nA: Thanks for pointing out the typos. We did double check and made the corrections.

The proposed algorithm is a adversarial autoencoder with learned prior generation of point clouds. From this point of view, the novelty of the paper is limited, also, the authors failed to discuss all the related works properly. \n\nA:\nWe must say with regret and respect that Reviewer#3 has unfortunately missed the essence of the article by a large margin. The proposed DUAL ADVERSARIAL MODEL is anything but a more general framework to synthesize data (as Reviewer#1 pointed out). Our approach is absolutely not \u201ca(n) adversarial autoencoder with learned prior generation of point clouds\u201d. \n\nWe were highly motivated by the well-known manifold hypothesis. The manifold hypothesis indicates that real-world data in a high-dimensional observation space always tends to live in the vicinity of an intrinsic low dimensional manifold (usually termed low dimensional representation). \n\nSpecifically, the set of images associated with the same class always forms a sub-manifold, i.e. a region with dimensionality lower than the original space. Furthermore, for an image dataset with multiple classes, the samples associated with different classes are likely to concentrate along distinct sub-manifolds (also low dimensional), which are separated by low density regions of the observation space. The manifold hypothesis is the underlying assumption of a collection of methodologies, e.g., manifold learning.\n\nFrom the manifold hypothesis as mentioned above, we know that the sample complexity depends heavily on the \u201cintrinsic\u201d dimensionality, but not the \u201cambient\u201d dimensionality. Roughly speaking, a normal sample could be divided into two different components - principal component and minor component. The principal component consists of the projection onto the space tangent to the class supporting sub-manifold, which captures most invariance associated with the samples of the class. The component lying in the space perpendicular to the tangent space controls the diversity of the sample and has a relatively minor amount of energy.\n\nObviously, the roles of the two generator-discriminator pairs (g_1, d_1) and (g_2, d_2) in DUAL ADVERSARIAL MODEL are to capture the informative intrinsic structure (principal component) in the tangent space and the diversity (minor component) in the ambient space, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the generator-discriminator pairs (g_1, d_1) in the intrinsic space and (g_2, d_2) in the ambient space. The experimental results also show the competitive performance of the proposed DUAL ADVERSARIAL MODEL for the synthesis of diverse 2D and 3D data with satisfied quality.\n\nAs such, we feel strongly that the article is in many aspects up to the standards of ICLR. The comment from Review#3 is a surprise to us. A re-examination of the article is sincerely requested.

How the module weights can be updated this way is unclear\n\nA:\nThanks for reading our paper carefully, and it id indeed a good question. We use the loss between $\\hat X_{real}$ and $X_{real}$ to update the parameter E. Although z did not pass g2, we can still do this through some tricks in the code. The purpose of this design is to not only help encoder generate latent code, but also help minimize the distance between representation z and \\bar{z} from encoder. \n\nQ2: G1 is updated twice in each iteration, according to algorithm 1 in paper (once during update of G1 and G). How the generator G1\u2019s output manages to converge to output z from encoder E is unclear.\n\nA\uff1a\nThanks. The reason why we let G1 be updated twice in one iteration is as follow: the first time we use Lgan(noise \\rightarrow z) to only update the G1 parameter, and the purpose of this step is to make the distribution of $\\hat z$ close to that of z; and then we use loss LG to update total model G including G1, in order to let G1 learn global information and increase the diversity of generator. \n\nQ3:\nThe authors claim that the proposed model has both better performance and efficiency. Although experimental results are provided to support claim for better performance, none have been offered for efficiency claim. (calculation of EMD distance seems to be very expensive computationally)\n\nA:\nThanks. The reason why we claim that our model has better efficiency is that our approach is one-stage, and the previous methods with similar ideas are two-stage. The previous approach need to train a model first and then use pre-trained model\u2019s result to train generator, while our model can be trained end-to-end, which will greatly shorten the training time.\n\nQ4:\nFor section 5.5, a quantitative analysis might make the claim for portability of the framework stronger. In paragraph 1 of introduction, disadvantage of 3d point cloud data can be better explained.\n\nA:\nThanks for you suggestion.

In the experiment, a small section is on 2D image data. In order not to confuse readers, I would suggest writing this paper as a general framework on both 2D and 3D data. Is there any particular reason for this work focusing on 3D point cloud data?\nA:\nA good question, In fact, we have been devoted to the problem of generating 3D point cloud. When I finished my manuscript, I happened to find that the model also works in 2D dataset, but at that time, there was less than one week before deadline, so we didn\u2019t have enough time to do more experiments on 2D dataset and rewrite our paper,thus we just show this part\u2019s results as a supplementary experiment of our model. We will seriously consider your suggestion in rhe future work.\n\nQ2\uff1a\nIn 2D data, how to measure the point-cloud distance? still using EMD and CD?\n\nA\uff1a\nThanks. We have added the quantitative analysis of the 2D results in section 5.5. In evaluating the model of generating 2D dataset, we usually use Inception Score(IS), 1-NN accuracy and so on. You can see a detailed description of them and some other metrics in [1].\n\nQ3: \nIn Figure 2, are you trying to minimize the distance between intermedia representation z and \\bar{z} from encoder and GAN respectively as well? I do not find corresponding step in Algorithm 1.\n\nA:\nThanks. The loss function LGAN(noise\\rightarrow z) is used to update parameters $\\theta_{G1}$ in order to minimize the distance between intermedia representation z and \\bar{z}. We describe this process in the third last line of Algorithm 1.\n\nQ3:\nHow is the lambda changing the results? The regularization is the main idea for this paper, and thus it would be interesting to see how the regularization trades off with the loss.\n\nA:\nThanks, a good question, The results are indeed affected by the value of the lambda, As the lambda increases, the generating results will lose their diversity. The results are shown in the appendix.\n\nQ3\uff1a\nhow is EMD's performance compared with CD?\n\nA\uff1a\nThanks. Do you mean the performance in section 5.2 and 5.3? This two sections evaluate the AE\u2019s capabilities in our model. We find CD get better performance than EMD, so we use CD as loss function in AE\u2019s training. In section 5.4, we show the performance of these two separately on evaluating the generation ability of total model.\n\n[1] Qiantong Xu, et al.

These point clouds correspond to objects shapes in 3-dimensions. According to the paper, previous approaches for generating such 3-D point clouds involved autoencoder and GANs used separately. The authors propose a framework combining both autoencoder and GAN in a single network. The authors claim that part of the network learns effective latent space embedding for 3-d point clouds corresponding to different objects and thus the entire network is more effective in generating 3-d point cloud. Experimental results are presented to support the claims for efficient embeddings, and better generation of 3-d point clouds.\n\nDecision\n\nThe paper has some lacking in explanation. I am particularly interested in the answers to the following questions:\n1.\tThe encoder module (denoted as E in the paper) uses a loss function that apparently does not involve the encoder output (z in the paper). How the module weights can be updated this way is unclear.\n2.\tG1 is updated twice in each iteration, according to algorithm 1 in paper (once during update of \ud835\udf3dG1 and \ud835\udf3dG). How the generator G1\u2019s output manages to converge to output z from encoder E is unclear.\n3.\tThe authors claim that the proposed model has both better performance and efficiency. Although experimental results are provided to support claim for better performance, none have been offered for efficiency claim. (calculation of EMD distance seems to be very expensive computationally)\n\nFeedback\n\nFor section 5.5, a quantitative analysis might make the claim for portability of the framework stronger. In paragraph 1 of introduction, disadvantage of 3d point cloud data can be better explained.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper729/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper729/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DUAL ADVERSARIAL MODEL FOR GENERATING 3D POINT CLOUD", "authors": ["Yuhang Zhang", "Zhenwei Miao", "Tiebin Mi", "Robert Caiming Qiu"], "authorids": ["hang_universe@sjtu.edu.cn", "zhenwei.mzw@alibaba-inc.com", "mitiebin@sjtu.edu.cn", "rcqiu@sjtu.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["point cloud", "generative", "latent space"], "abstract": "Three-dimensional data, such as point clouds, are often composed of three coordinates with few featrues.

The regularization is the main idea for this paper, and thus it would be interesting to see how the regularization trades off with the loss.\n\n5) how is EMD's performance compared with CD?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper729/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper729/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DUAL ADVERSARIAL MODEL FOR GENERATING 3D POINT CLOUD", "authors": ["Yuhang Zhang", "Zhenwei Miao", "Tiebin Mi", "Robert Caiming Qiu"], "authorids": ["hang_universe@sjtu.edu.cn", "zhenwei.mzw@alibaba-inc.com", "mitiebin@sjtu.edu.cn", "rcqiu@sjtu.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["point cloud", "generative", "latent space"], "abstract": "Three-dimensional data, such as point clouds, are often composed of three coordinates with few featrues.

In this paper, we focus on latent space\u2019s representation of data characteristics, introduce a novel generative framework based on AutoEncoder(AE) and Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) with extra well-designed loss. We embed this framework directly into the raw 3D-GAN, and experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework in regard of improving the performance on the public dataset compared with other point cloud generation models proposed in recent years. It even achieves state of-the-art performance. We also perform experiments on MNIST and exhibit an excellent result on 2D dataset.", "pdf": "/pdf/d2049d0a0992ddb2297a53bc0da25e8259dd7b09.pdf", "paperhash": "zhang|dual_adversarial_model_for_generating_3d_point_cloud", "original_pdf": "/attachment/579e7061ea08f976bacc31f21025b5b3cba347a1.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nzhang2020dual,\ntitle={{\\{}DUAL{\\}} {\\{}ADVERSARIAL{\\}} {\\{}MODEL{\\}} {\\{}FOR{\\}} {\\{}GENERATING{\\}} 3D {\\{}POINT{\\}} {\\{}CLOUD{\\}}},\nauthor={Yuhang Zhang and Zhenwei Miao and Tiebin Mi and Robert Caiming Qiu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lyiaVFwB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
