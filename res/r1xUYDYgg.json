We think our work matches this topic.\nThe objective of our system is to provide accelerated deep learning system to non-experts who are not able to maintain server cluster. We are proposing a unique design for non-experts, which is different from using a cloud platform. Our system can desterilize idle resources which non-experts have. WebCL is a specification that is independent of OS and browser. The key point of our system is that when WebCL is implemented on a platform, our system immediately works on it without installation.\nAdditionally, although there are some matrix libraries for JavaScript, our proposed library has unique design in which basic matrix manipulation features have similar interfaces to MATLAB. It allows new users to create application easily.\nThe reason that the calculation speed is not reaching the state-of-the-art is due to the optimization level of low-level library (OpenCL / CUDA + cuDNN), as noted in the paper. This level of optimization is not main focus of this paper. CUDA only works with NVIDIA GPU, but OpenCL is hardware-independent, so it works with most personal computers. Caffe with OpenCL and our system achieved similar performance, so we can expect that the performance will be improved by further updates of low-level libraries."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Development of JavaScript-based deep learning platform and application to distributed training", "abstract": "Deep learning is increasingly attracting attention for processing big data.\nExisting frameworks for deep learning must be set up to specialized computer systems.

Code for matrix library sushi2 and DL library sukiyaki2 are on github, including live demos that run in your browser.\n\nhttps://mil-tokyo.github.io/sukiyaki2/examples/mnist/ was fun, but seemed very slow (5 mnist images per second). The demo page would be more interesting if it showed what model was being trained, which implementation was being used (pure js or webcl?), which hardware was being used for the computation, and how that compared with other people who logged into the page. As it is, the demo is kind of unclear as to what is happening.\n\nRelevance:\n\nThe grand vision of a DLTraining@Home is exciting. While much work remains, having a solid WebCL foundation seems valuable. The big advantage of javascript is that it runs everywhere, especially on idle desktops and laptops around the world. However, these sorts of computers do not (with probability 1) have K80 or S9120 video cards. Instead, they have a wide variety of every consumer-grade card ever sold, which call for different blocking, tiling, and looping strategies in the computational kernels that underpin deep learning inference and training algorithms (hence, autotuning), which isn't discussed.\n\nSushi2 and Sukiyaki2 seem relatively young as projects. They are not widely followed on github, there is no tutorial-style documentation for Sukiyaki2, and the implementations of e.g. convolution do not seem to have seen much engineering work. Speed of evaluation seems to be one of the main focal points of the paper, but it\u2019s not a major selling point to the ICLR audience because it seems about \u00bc as fast as e.g. cuDNN on standard (e.g. AWS nodes) NVidia hardware. The performance of sukiyaki2 vs AMD's Caffe port is impressive.\n\nBenchmarking on high-end compute server hardware is an interesting point of reference, but the questions that come to mind for me when reading this paper are\n\n(1) How would this fit into a live-video processing application on a mobile device\n(2) What kind of a \u201ccluster\u201d would this present to someone trying to do distributed deep learning in the wild by drawing on idle graphics cards: how much memory do they have, how might we handle data for training on such computers, what is the compute speed vs. communication latency and bandwidth.\n\nAnswers to these questions are out of scope for this paper, but it would have been interesting to see at least some preliminary discussion.\n\nNovelty:\nI\u2019m not aware of a more mature WebCL-based HPC library.\n\nPresentation:\nTable 1 is hard to read because it is actually two tables with different formatting, and the numbers (speeds?) aren\u2019t labeled with units.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Development of JavaScript-based deep learning platform and application to distributed training", "abstract": "Deep learning is increasingly attracting attention for processing big data.\nExisting frameworks for deep learning must be set up to specialized computer systems.

The authors show that it is possible to reach competitive speeds with this technology, even higher speed than a compiled application with ViennaCL on AMD GPUs. While remaining a little more than factor three slower than compiled high performance software on NVIDIA GPUs, it offers compelling possibilities for easily deployable training and application settings for deep learning.\n\nMy main points of criticism are:\n1. In Tab. 4 different batch sizes are used. Even if this is due to technical limits for the Javascript library, it would only be fair to use the smaller batch sizes for the other frameworks as well (on the GPUs probably in favor of the presented framework).\n\n2. In Fig. 6, why not include more information in the graphs? Especially, as stated in the question, why not include the node.js values? While I do see the possible application with one server and many \"low performance\" clients, the setting of having a few dedicated high performance servers is quite likely. Even if not, these are good values to compare with.
