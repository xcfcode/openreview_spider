I still believe that this paper is a novel contribution with clear impressive results.\n\n# The main idea: \nDeveloping an unsupervised imagedenoising approach is difficult because the real world noise distribution is much more complex than the simplified AWGN assumptions. The authors address this by mapping the noisy image into a latent space in which. AWGN assumption holds, and thus any existing gaussian denoiser is applicable.  The authors claim that the network can be trained with the input image itself and does not require any pertaining in other datasets.\n\nThis is a clever idea, it essentially is MAP gaussian denoising with a variational auto encoder as the likelihood model.\n\nSince it is an image-specific network it reduces the need for wide-space sampling fo the data distribution.  How fast is it?  The authors optimize with ADMM iteratively updating network weights and image estimates (which can be time consuming).  No mention is made of compute time when compared to comparable methods.\n\nThe encoder and decoder network shapes and architectures are chosen without much reasoning given other than that they are standard choices.  Did the authors explore any hyper parameter sweeps (of the Unet architectures specifically) in this space to see if performance was further improved or impoverished by different choices?\n\nStrength:\nCan be utilized with other existing gaussian denoisers to improve their performance.\n\nVisual Results are high quality and show clear improvement for baseline methods.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe visual improvement for NN+DnCNN is debatable though the other results show significant improvement. (At least in the chosen examples)\n\nThe following is stated as fact but is not backed up with data.\n\nIt is noted that there is an expectation term in (4) that can be estimated by the Monte Carlo method and there is no need for a large amount of samples in practice. In our experiments, the sampling number is equal to 1.\n\n\nPlease fix:\nOn page 1 you write 'Due to the violence of the AWGN assumption\u201d I assume this is supposed to read \u201cDue to the violation\u201d.\n\nAlso, on page 5 you write :\n\"Remark 1 In our model, the basic assumption is that the latent image z is a white Gaussian per- turbations of clean image x, i.e. z|x \u223c N (x, \u03c32I). Since z = G\u03b82 (y), the second term in (4) can be seen as the transformed data fidelity while the first term is a regularization such that the encoder avoids from the trivial mappings, e.g. identity map or zero map.\" \n\nThe first term, which is  1E\u03b5||F\u03b81(G\u03b82(y)+\u03b5)\u2212y||2  does prevent a zero mapping, but does not on it's own prevent the identity map (it is in fact encouraging it).  However, the combination of the first, second ( 1 ||G\u03b82(y)\u2212x||2) and third (\u03bbR(x)) is what pushes against the degenerate identity mapping solution.

The central idea is to use a neural network to map the noisy image to a latent image space where the noisy distribution follows Gaussian (like Variance Stabliziation Transform) and then use a off-the-shelf Gaussian denoiser on this image. The paper shows good numerical results. \n\n1. The details of the algorithm is not clear to me. Suppose your noisy image, y has pure Poisson noise. When you use Algorithm 1 and try to apply Gaussian denoiser to $x^{k+1}+q^{k}/\\rho$ does it still work? In my experience, these algorithms, particularly DnCNN is very sensitive to the type of the noise and I wonder how much of this algorithm holds when the noise distribution is significantly different from Gaussian. The test cases (including the synthetic noise) here seems to be very close to Gaussian. Authors should produce evidence that the algorithm can actually work on noise distribution significantly different from Gaussian distribution. \n\n2.

Also, the authors state \n\n\"the proposed NN approximates the likelihood in the classic Bayesian framework, which gives clear interpretations of each loss term\"\n\nbut show no evidence that the terms are actually meaningful. Due to the lack of analysis, the method seems very ad hoc. For example, it is unclear what role the decoder has. How do the results change with different choices of encoder/decoder? It would be very helpful to add some ablation studies. \n\nAlso, the authors show that the method is stable with respect to the hyperparameters, but it seems to be that there should be a meaningful dependence with $\\sigma$. How should it be estimated if you want to train on a single image, where the noise is not Gaussian? In the experimental section, they state: \"The noise level is estimated from Donoho & Johnstone (1994); Chen et al. (2015a)\". Is this related to $\\sigma$? I don't understand what the authors mean.\n\n*Clarity*: \n\nThe paper is not written clearly. It took me a while to understand what the authors were actually doing.\n\n*Significance*:\n\nIt seems to me that the authors have designed a promising method, but unfortunately they do not provide enough insight and analysis to show why it may work, or what the limitations may be. This will limit the possible impact and usefulness of the paper significantly.\n\n*Pros*:\n\nThe method is interesting and novel to the best of my knowledge. It produces promising results.\n\n*Cons*: \n\nNot much analysis. Confusing motivation. Lack of clarity.\n\nUpdated review: I appreciate the authors' response and have updated my rating. However, I still believe that the clarity of the exposition could be improved.

The proposed methods are reported to have improved performance compared to original Gaussian denoisers combined in their methods. One specific proposed combination, i.e., NN+BM3D shows better results than other unsurprised denoising approaches and is competitive with a supervised network. The idea of this paper is interesting and the presentation of the major idea is relatively clear.\n\nHowever, the reviewer suggests that the authors address the following questions and issues to make the paper clearer:\n1. Near equation (1), please define $y$, i.e., an input noisy image.\n2. In (2), I think a $\\lambda$ is missing and the equal sign does not hold. There should be a constant. Further, seem that the dimension of an image, i.e., $N$, is also used as an iteration number in Algorithm 1. Please avoid this confusion, unless there is a reason to do so.\n3. Before Remark 1, the authors mention that the sampling number is equal to 1. I think it would be better to mention when this sample is taken in Algorithm 1. Currently, in my guess, I think $\\epsilon$ is re-sampled every time before backpropagation is made so that it looks like a \"stochastic\" step, however, there are also other possibilities. Please clarify this.\n4. For Algorithm 1, there is a significant concern for initializing network parameters $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$. Are they randomly initialized for your optimization algorithm, or they are inherited from some pre-trained models? I have this concern because in my mind, when updating $x$, it should not go too far away from $y$, and it gradually converges to the final results. If $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are randomly initialized, $x$ might be very different from $y$ in the first several steps and the convergence is not very straightforward. However, if it can still converge, then the robustness of this algorithm can be demonstrated. Please clarify how these parameters are initialized.\n5. I recommend that the authors show the latent image and denoised image in $k_{\\rm th}$ iteration step for different $k$ in Algorithm 1. The results for NN+BM3D and one noisy image could be enough. For example, the authors can show the latent image at the first several iteration steps and the latent image when the algorithm tends to converge.\n6. Are the results of DnCNN+, FFDNet+, CBDNet, etc., directly copied from other papers, for example, Hou et al. (2019)? If so, please highlight this, for example, with footnotes. Further, please clarify why the results for the proposed method in Hou et al. (2019) are not compared.\n7. It is better to mention the running time in section 4 or 5, rather than in the Appendix.\n\n-----\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nI think the authors well-addressed my comments. Thanks for their efforts.
