In the end, the bound is shown to be minimized by the true labeling function for the source, and at this minimum, the value of the bound is shown to also control the \"joint error\", i.e., the best achievable risk on both target and source by a single classifier. \n\nThe point of the analysis is to go beyond the target risk bound presented by Ben-David et al. 2010 that is in terms of the discrepancy between the source and target and the performance of the source labeling function on the target or vice versa, whichever is smaller. Apparently, concrete domain adaptation methods \"based on\" the Ben-David et al. bound do not end up controlling the joint error. After various heuristic arguments, the authors develop an algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation based on their bound in terms of a two-player game.\n\nOnly one reviewer ended up engaging with the authors in a nontrivial way. This review also argued for (weak) acceptance. Another reviewer mostly raised minor issues about grammar/style and got confused by the derivation of the \"general\" bound, which I've checked is ok. The third reviewer raised some issues around the realizability assumption and also asked for better understanding as to what aspects of the new proposal are responsible for the improved performance, e.g., via an ablation study.\n\nI'm sympathetic to reviewer 1, even though I wish they had engaged with the rebuttal. I don't believe the revision included any ablation study. I think this would improve the paper. I don't think the issues raised by reviewer 3 rise to the level of rejection, especially since their main technical concern is due to their own confusion. Reviewer 2 argues for weak acceptance.

We assume you mean $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ since we never use $\\mu$ in the paper. From Fig. 4a, Fig. 5c and Fig.5d, we can see a good performance heavily relies on the choice of hyper-parameters. However, currently we have not built an automatic approach to find the optimum, since they are closely related to the domain shift between source and target, which is usually hard to assess without using target labels (the domain shift here does not simply mean the dissimilarity of the two distributions, but the generalization performance of the feature extractor trained on source). During serval experiments, we find that setting $\\eta=0.9$ works for most of the cases. We intend to tackle this challenging problem in the future work by maybe introducing some prior distributions over these hyper-parameters and optimizing the entire objective in a bayesian framework. \n\n5.

Thanks for pointing it out and actually we have already checked Mansour et al., COLT'09. The reason we did not include it is that we find it almost identical to one of the theorem proposed in Ben-David et al. We will briefly show the difference here.\nThe bound proposed in Mansour et al. can be reached by:\n$$\\epsilon_T(h,f_T) \\leq \\epsilon_T(h,h_T) + \\epsilon_T(h_T,f_T)$$\n$$= \\epsilon_T(h, h_T) - \\epsilon_S(h, h_T) + \\epsilon_S(h, h_T)  + \\epsilon_T(h_T,f_T)$$\n$$\\leq disc (S,T) + \\epsilon_S(h, h_S) + \\epsilon_T(h_T,f_T) + \\epsilon_S(h_S, h_T)$$\n\nAnalogously:\n$$\\epsilon_T(h,f_T) \\leq \\epsilon_T(h,h_S) + \\epsilon_T(h_S,f_T)$$\n$$= \\epsilon_T(h, h_S) - \\epsilon_S(h, h_S) + \\epsilon_S(h, h_S)  + \\epsilon_T(h_S,f_T)$$\n$$\\leq disc (S,T) + \\epsilon_S(h, h_S)  + \\epsilon_T(h_T,f_T)+\\epsilon_T(h_S,h_T)$$\n\nThis can be summarized as:\n$$\\epsilon_T(h,f_T) \\leq disc (S,T) + \\epsilon_S(h, h_S)  + \\epsilon_T(h_T,f_T)+\\min (\\epsilon_S(h_S, h_T), \\epsilon_T(h_S,h_T))$$\nwhere $h_S=\\mathop{\\rm arg~min}_{h \\in H}\\epsilon_S(h,f_S)$ and $h_T=\\mathop{\\rm arg~min}_{h \\in H}\\epsilon_T(h,f_T)$\n\nWhile the Theorem 2 in Ben-David et al. can be expressed as:\n$$\\epsilon_T(h,f_T) \\leq disc (S,T) + \\epsilon_S(h, f_S)  +\\min (\\epsilon_S(f_S, f_T), \\epsilon_T(f_S,f_T))$$\n\nIf we further assume H contains $f_S$ and $f_T$, these two become equivalent.\n\nMansour et al. compared the two bounds by assuming $h_S=h_T$ , which is actually as non-realistic as  assuming $f_S=f_T$. However, we do appreciate their contributions on extending the H-divergence to general loss functions which leads to the discrepancy distance. Since our bounds does not contain the terms used in theirs, a direct comparison is a little difficult. However, [1] mentioned that MCD exploited a tighter bound of the one proposed in Ben-David et al. where the supremum term (H-divergence) is, up to a constant, equivalent to the maximal accuracy of a binary domain discriminator. And judging from the relationship between ours and MCD showed in section 3.4.2,  by choosing appropriate constraint for the hypothesis space, our bound shows superiority (at least not worse than MCD by setting $\\gamma=1$). Besides, several experiments (Digit, VisDA, Office-31, Office-Home) show that our bound performs much better than those methods purely based on Ben-David et al., like ADDA and DANN.\n\n2. We do agree that when domain shift is relatively small and the performance on source could maintained in a high standard, a large gamma always gives the best performance (our experiment results also reveal this). And in such case, the difference between ours and MCD lies only in the consideration on classic joint error (MCD does not consider the joint error). One may think we can ignore the joint error here, but according to [2], the joint error can change during distribution matching. Even if the joint error is small at the initial stage, it can grow during the training procedure. Especially when samples from different domains are mismatched, those methods which do not consider the joint error could become unbounded, while ours can constantly penalize such undesirable case. \n\n3. We assume you suggest that we should use the correlation ratios instead of a fixed hyper-parameter $\\eta$. (Please correct us if we get you wrong)\nThis is indeed an interesting idea. However, if the induced feature space is well separated according to the class labels for both domains, the correlation ratios should be close to 1 (we are not so sure about it since we never check the correlation ratios). This implies the situation that source and target (solid boundary orange circle and dotted boundary orange circle in Fig. 2b) lie in the same side of $f_2$, which can not provide reliable gradient for feature extractor to bring them together. While in our proposal, by choosing an appropriate $f_2$ that could partially classify source and target (Fig. 2b), we can minimize the shadow area w.r.t the feature extractor to bring the source and target closer.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper559/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper559/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A General Upper Bound for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation", "authors": ["Dexuan Zhang", "Tatsuya Harada"], "authorids": ["dexuan.zhang@mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "harada@mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["unsupervised domain adaptation", "upper bound", "joint error", "hypothesis space constraint", "cross margin discrepancy"], "TL;DR": "joint error matters for unsupervised domain adaptation especially when the domain shift is huge", "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel upper bound of target error to address the problem for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Eq.3 is from triangle inequality.\n\n3. We explain this in Eq.3 and Eq.4 that our bound is minimized when $h=f_S$, and in such case our proposal is equivalent to an upper bound of optimal joint error. This means, ideally, our proposal can minimize the upper bound of optimal joint error (the overlapping area 2 and 5 in Fig. 1b), which is ignored by common methods. This kind of overlap can be caused by unsupervised distribution matching, since there is no guarantee that samples from different domains can be correctly matched according to their class labels (we don't have target label). Traditional methods can not prevent such mismatch since they ignore the joint error during  training  procedure, while ours can constantly penalize such undesired case.  \n\n4. We do agree that dotted boundary might be hard to discern and thanks for your nice suggestion. However, we've already put numbers and shadows inside the circles in Fig.1, Fig.2 and Fig.3 which are more essential to explaining our idea. Therefore, there is no more space to put A,B inside circles without overlap and dotted boundary seems to be our best choice currently. If you have any other suggestions, we are all ears.

We do agree that it is not easy to find the true labeling function inside a specific hypothesis space. However, we believe it is not a strong assumption that labeling functions lie in a hypothesis space with enough complexity. For instance, [1] makes a similar assumption that H includes $f_T$. Besides, since the algorithm is always run within finite samples, there is quite likely to be a function inside a specific hypothesis space that could perfectly mimic the behavior of the true labeling function on those samples. Therefore, even if the hypothesis space we use does not contain the true labeling function, it will not harm the actual training process. Moreover, the performance on 4 benchmarks (Digits, VisDA, Office-31, Office-Home) is a good evidence that our proposal is reliable when dealing with the real world problems.\n\n2. As for the experimental results of $f_1$ and $f_2$, we've already included them inside the code we submit. The reason we did not include it in the main body of the paper is that we found it unnecessary, especially considering the page limit. The behavior of $f_1$ and $f_2$ during training process is just like h, the target accuracy growing at first then becoming stable, nothing special except that $f_2$ usually shows better performance as it leverage the information from pseudo-labeled target samples. \n\n3. We assume you mean $f_1$ in MCD and h in MDD since h' does not appear in our paper. Actually, we do not understand why you have such concern on the difference among the obtained classifiers of ours and others, since a huge difference compared to MCD or MDD does not imply the superiority or inferiority. Currently, we can not provide the comparisons of each parameters in the learned network, however, judging from the result in Table 2 (visda dataset), our proposals tend to perform well in identifying truck, where MCD shows substantially lower accuracy. Therefore, we believe the obtained classifiers of ours and MCD are quite different.\n\n4. We assume your last question is about the effectiveness of our upper bound and cross margin discrepancy respectively (Please correct us if we are wrong since we are not sure what do you mean by new adversarial adaptation method). The answers can be found in Table 1 and Table 2. The first row of our methods shows the effectiveness of the proposed upper bound, where we use $L_1$ as the discrepancy measurement and improves the performance from directly comparable MCD. The second row shows the result when replacing $L_1$ with cross margin discrepancy. The last row shows the result when leveraging the information from pseudo-labeled target samples to construct a more reliable hypothesis space for $f_2$. From the results, we can see they all help to improve the performance. \n\nPlease do not hesitate to tell us if you have more concerns.\n\n\n[1] Mansour et al.

The new theory can be expanded into a novel algorithm. Experiments on domain adaptation datasets demonstrate improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.\nThe authors propose to incorporate lambda into adversarial feature learning. Specifically, the authors assume that f_s and f_t are from some hypothesis space H. Then relaxing f_s and f_t to f_1 and f_2, we can turn the problem into a minimax game between f_1, f_2 and feature extractor g. To further implement their method, the authors propose to constrain f_1 and f_2 with source accuracy and target pseudo label accuracy. Based on the margin theory, the authors also introduce the cross margin discrepancy, which increase the reliability of adversarial adaptation.\nThe paper is well-written and the contributions are stated clearly. The attempt to incorporate lambda into feature learning is really interesting.\n\nHowever, I have several concerns:\n*The proposed theory of equation (4), (5), and (6) is problematic. h is the hypothesis which belongs to a hypothesis class H. f_s and f_t are true labeling functions, and do not necessarily belong to the hypothesis space H. In this sense, the inequality of equation (4) does not hold. Problems of equation (5) and (6) are similar. The authors do realize that the supremum term can be arbitrarily large and put constraints to f_1 and f_2. But no matter what hypothesis class we are using, it generally does not contain the true labeling functions, and what we can do is only approximating them. Thus, in spite of the good performance of the proposed method, the proposed upper bound is not reliable.\n*Lack of experimental results on the role of f_1 and f_2. The proposed method demonstrates good performance, but the manuscript does not provide some experimental results on the source of performance gain. In particular, how is f_1 and f_2 changed during training? Are they substantially different from the h\u2019in MCD and MDD? Besides, how does each part contribute to the performance gain? Is it from the novel loss function or just the new adversarial adaptation method itself? A proper ablation study would be helpful. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper559/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper559/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A General Upper Bound for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation", "authors": ["Dexuan Zhang", "Tatsuya Harada"], "authorids": ["dexuan.zhang@mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "harada@mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["unsupervised domain adaptation", "upper bound", "joint error", "hypothesis space constraint", "cross margin discrepancy"], "TL;DR": "joint error matters for unsupervised domain adaptation especially when the domain shift is huge", "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel upper bound of target error to address the problem for unsupervised domain adaptation.

They propose to replace it by considering discrepancy between information on constrained class hypothesis and a possible discrepancy term that related the learned model with the class A cross-margin discrepancy is proposed in the multiclass context. They extend their approach by proposing to reweight differently some errors with an expected performance of target models on source and an additional one where they distinguish the performance with respect to accuracy on pseudo-labeled target data. Their approach leads to an adversarial-based loss function to optimize which is evaluated on two visual domain adaptation tasks. \n\nEvaluation\n--------\nThe idea is novel and I find the discussion on the considered restriction on the hypothesis class interesting. The experimental evaluation is interesting with good results reported on the two problems considered. I think that some parts could be improved in terms of presentation, in particular The paper contains many typos that make sometimes the reading difficult.\n\nOther comments\n------------\n\n-The comparison with other existing bounds is interesting. I think the authors should expand this by also taking into consideration the bound of Mansour et al., COLT'09 which has some links with the proposed approach (check their comparison to Ben-David's bound). \nThe links with this bound and the one of Ben-David could also be summarized in an appendix, I would like to see a better characterization of the cases where the proposed bound is better and worse. \n\n-About original proposal. I am wondering if the authors could discuss the relationship between the value of \\gamma and the expressiveness of the considered model. If the model is powerful enough, \\gamma should certainly be large. In a context of a training with \"Learning without forgetting\" strategy, the performance on source could maintained in a high standard. \nNote that in this context, the classic joint error of Ben-David et al. can be considered as rather small.\n\n-About the alternative proposal: I am a bit skeptical on the ration \\eta and (1-\\eta) for accuracy on source and pseudo-labeled data respectively. Indeed, since the pseudo-labels are obtained from a classifier that make use a lot of source information, one may think that their performance is rather related. So using to correlated ratios would probably be more relevant here, but maybe the authors can bring some arguments against.\n\n-In the experimental evaluation, the tuning of the different parameters, in particular \\gamma and \\mu, is not particularly discussed and there is probably an issue. I tend to think that these values are rather difficult to assess. A discussion on this point would be welcomed.\n\n-I am not sure to understand the optimization problem (8), (9) and (18), in particular the term after the \"s.t.\": I would expect an inequality somewhere, otherwise everything can be added to the general objective function. If there is an alternate optimization scheme, this should be mentioned explicitly.\n\n-Table 1 and Table 2: use a third identifier different from the second for the last version of your method.\n\n-Please check the typos.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper559/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper559/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A General Upper Bound for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation", "authors": ["Dexuan Zhang", "Tatsuya Harada"], "authorids": ["dexuan.zhang@mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp", "harada@mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["unsupervised domain adaptation", "upper bound", "joint error", "hypothesis space constraint", "cross margin discrepancy"], "TL;DR": "joint error matters for unsupervised domain adaptation especially when the domain shift is huge", "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel upper bound of target error to address the problem for unsupervised domain adaptation.
