The authors compare different diversity metrics, which they named collectively as Q-metric, visualize the accuracies of different ensembles on CIFAR-10 dataset where the ensembles are stratified by their sizes. Based on their observation,  the authors further propose HQ-metric, HQ(\\alpha) and HQ(\\alpha +K) to improve the diversity score from Q-metrics. The authors evaluate their strategies on CIFAR-10 and  on all of the Q-metircs  and show that those Q-metric, when incorporating their proposed strategies, in general, is capable of selecting ensembles of higher accuracy. \n\nStrengths:\n\n1 The manuscript provides somewhat detailed analysis of correlation between diversity score obtained from KW, GD and ensemble accuracy with the ensembles stratified by their respective sizes. \n2 The manuscript attempts in different ways to improve the diversity score from those metrics and empirically evaluated their strategies on ensemble models train on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.\n\nWeaknesses \n\n1.\tBiases in the analysis\n\nOn page 3, it is mentioned that \u201c Given a Q-diversity metric, we calculate the diversity score for each ensemble team in the ensemble set (EnsSet) using a set of negative samples (NegSampSet)\u201d .\nWhy is it that only negative samples are used in the analysis? In this case, is it fair to say that the results from the analysis is biased (since the distribution of the testing set is different from training set)? \n\n2\tUnsubstantiated claims/arguments\n\na)\tOn page 4  \u201cThe Qdiversity metrics may not accurately capture the degree of negative correlation among the member models of an ensemble even when its ensemble Q-diversity score is below the mean threshold. \u201d\n              Can authors verify this? Can authors actually show how inaccurate the Q-metrics are in measuring the negative correlation between ensemble members?\nb)\tOn page 5 \u201cThese two optimizations enable HQ scores to more accurately capture the ensemble diversity and its relationship with the ensemble accuracy\u201d\nWhy is it so? Can authors provide a more rigorous proof to this, instead of just showing some empirical examples?\n\n3.\tConfusing to read\n\na)\tOn page 4, it is mentioned that \u201cComparing ensembles of different team size S using their Q scores may not be a fair measure of their true ensemble diversity in terms of the degree of negative correlation among member models of an ensemble\u201d\nCan authors explain what is exactly \u201ctrue ensemble diversity in terms of the degree of negative correlation among member models\u201d? Aren\u2019t  ensemble diversity and negative correlation two different concepts? Why negative correlation matters here? Why not non-correlatedness? The authors have mentioned negative correlation multiple times as the \u201climitations\u201d of previous approaches, giving readers an impression that it is a crucial property for a good ensemble of DNN models to have and yet offering no evidence or proof that ensembles with high negative correlation are more likely to yield better accuracy. Finally, the authors did not show that the ensembles selected by their approach do, on average, have higher negative correlation among the ensemble members \n\nb)\tOn page 5 \u201cwe argue that comparing ensembles of the same team size in terms of their diversity scores can better capture the intrinsic relationship between ensemble diversity and ensemble accuracy\u201d\nCan authors give a more formal definition to \u201cthe intrinsic relationship between ensemble diversity and ensemble accuracy\u201d and at same time give some explanation as to why comparing the diversity scores of the ensembles of the same size can better capture such relationship?\n\n4.\t Way too empirical\n\nOverall, the strategies proposed in the manuscript rely heavily on the empirical observations from the performance of a few models trained on one dataset. Thus, it is hard to say how applicable such strategies are when the scenario slight changes (say, the number of base models for selection is at the magnitude of hundreds or thousands or even more, or the dataset for training models is a much smaller dataset from a specialized domain). \nFor instance, on p.5 \u201cWe observe that if an ensemble team of size S has large HQ score (say [F5, F6]), indicating insufficient ensemble diversity, then all the ensemble teams that have larger size than S and contain all the member models of this ensemble team (e.g., [F5, F6, F7], [F0, F5, F6], [F0, F5, F6, F7], [F5, F6, F7, F8]) tend to have insufficient ensemble diversity\u201d. Yet Fig.1(a) does show that the ensemble of a larger size (colored red) have lower scores. So the question becomes is it possible that the effects from the errors made in the early stages could be undone by the correct choices in later steps, particularly when there is a large pool of base models?   Since the ensemble selection problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem, there might exist a more principled approach to this.  See the following reference as an example. \nB\u00fchlmann, Peter, and Nicolai Meinshausen. \"Magging: maximin aggregation for inhomogeneous large-scale data.\" Proceedings of the IEEE 104.1 (2015): 126-135.\n\n5.\tSome mistake\n\nOn page 5  should \u201c(M,  2)  = M(M \u2212 1) candidate ensemble\u201d actually be \u201cM(M \u2212 1)/2\u201d . So should  \u201c For M = 10 we will have 90 teams of size 2\u201d be \u201c45 teams of size 2\u201d\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2023/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2023/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Ensembles with Hierarchical Diversity Pruning", "authorids": ["~Yanzhao_Wu1", "~Ling_Liu3"], "authors": ["Yanzhao Wu", "Ling Liu"], "keywords": ["Ensemble", "Diversity Metrics", "Hierarchical Pruning", "Ensemble Accuracy", "Deep Neural Networks"], "abstract": "Diverse deep ensembles hold the potential for improving accuracy and robustness of deep learning models.

Furthermore, it's unclear why this paper focuses on deep learning models. Do the proposed diversity measures work only for deep learning models? Why? Would they work also on other models, and regardless of the models used for the ensemble components?

I would shorten it to leave space to core explanations.\n\n- Results of Table 1: the authors state that the mean threshold is computed on 1013 candidate deep ensembles. Which deep models were used? The authors need also to clarify that M=10 (this becomes clear only later) in this experiment, and how the individual subsets were generated (randomly?). State upfront what's the purpose of this experiment.\n\n- Figure 1: I don't think (c) is showing much of \"a sharper trend in terms of the relationship between ensemble diversity and ensemble accuracy\" as claimed by the authors. For a given diversity value below the threshold, there is still a range of accuracies being obtained by the ensembles with that diversity level. So I am not sure what's the added value of plot (c). I understand the authors are trying to motivate their choice of comparing ensembles of the same size, but this plot does not serve the purpose well.\n\n- When introducing the concept of focal model in 2.2: \"..., we introduce the concept of focal model to obtain the set of negative samples for computing the diversity scores of ensembles by taking each member model in turn as the focal model.\" This statement is totally obscure to me. What are the negative samples? How is a focal model selected. The explanations in this paragraph are not useful. \n\n- The HQ (alpha) method does not work that well. It's comparable to standard diversity measures on CIFAR-10, and worse than standard diversity measures on Cora. This raises the question whether it's basically the extra step of clustering that gives an advantage to HQ (alpha + K).\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2023/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2023/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Ensembles with Hierarchical Diversity Pruning", "authorids": ["~Yanzhao_Wu1", "~Ling_Liu3"], "authors": ["Yanzhao Wu", "Ling Liu"], "keywords": ["Ensemble", "Diversity Metrics", "Hierarchical Pruning", "Ensemble Accuracy", "Deep Neural Networks"], "abstract": "Diverse deep ensembles hold the potential for improving accuracy and robustness of deep learning models.

However, I think this study lacks theoretical supports to back the statements that have been obtained experimentally.  \nAlso, the contributions made by the paper do not seem significant.  \nHQ-diversity metrics proposed in this study, as the authors also mention it, are an extension of the Q-diversity metrics (first paragraph of section 2.1).\nIn the proposed extension, HQ-diversity metrics are a normalized (scaled) version of the Q-diversity metrics in which the model accuracy rank is also considered. One question that arises here is whether the obtained improvement in accuracy is because of the normalization step or considering the accuracy rank to weight the models or both steps are essential. Also, I am wondering how costly would be validating the accuracy of the models. In my opinion, it will be more reasonable to include a time complexity comparison too. \nRegarding the presented strategy for pruning, I am not sure how efficient is the proposed filtering strategy in a real application when one needs to generate many ensembles of different sizes and then go through a costly stage-wise pruning.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2023/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2023/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Ensembles with Hierarchical Diversity Pruning", "authorids": ["~Yanzhao_Wu1", "~Ling_Liu3"], "authors": ["Yanzhao Wu", "Ling Liu"], "keywords": ["Ensemble", "Diversity Metrics", "Hierarchical Pruning", "Ensemble Accuracy", "Deep Neural Networks"], "abstract": "Diverse deep ensembles hold the potential for improving accuracy and robustness of deep learning models.
