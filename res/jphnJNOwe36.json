As the reviewer notes, this is a timely problem, and so we believe that progress in this regard is of interest. We hope that our study can help guide further explorations in this new field.\n\n*# The findings presented in Figure 4 is interesting (mainly the fact that the overparametrization seem to be improving the worst-group performance with threshold tuning). It would be interesting to see more investigation/discussion of what could be the underlying reason.*\n\nThis is one of our central points: the classification layer is biased against rare subgroups. However, increasing model complexity also allows for better modelling (i.e., learned representations) of such samples. This is why, with suitable tuning, one can achieve better performance than in underparameterised settings.\n\nNote also that Sagawa et al. \u201820b already demonstrated that another technique -- subsampling -- can similarly show improvements on worst subgroup performance as model complexity increases. Compared to this, we show that the learned representations from standard training may themselves be sufficient to improve worst subgroup performance.\n\nWe have fixed all typos, and updated Figure 2 to have clearer separation from the legend, and use colourblind-friendly colours."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1977/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1977/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overparameterisation and worst-case generalisation: friend or foe?", "authorids": ["~Aditya_Krishna_Menon1", "~Ankit_Singh_Rawat1", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Aditya Krishna Menon", "Ankit Singh Rawat", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["overparameterisation", "worst-case generalisation"], "abstract": "Overparameterised neural networks have demonstrated the remarkable ability to perfectly fit training samples, while still generalising to unseen test samples.

Given that all three datasets are simplified/synthetic (only one attribute, max. 4 subgroups), it would have been great to see how this paper's analysis applied to more complex settings.*\n\nTo show the applicability of our findings in more complex settings, we have added results on:\n1) CelebA with a larger (64) number of subgroups in Appendix A.1 (see details below).\n2) a modified version of the MNIST dataset in Appendix A.3, comprising 10 labels and 20 total subgroups. This data is based on the setup of [Goel et al., 2020], and comprises a mixture of standard MNIST and a \u201ccorrupted\u201d version with zig-zag images.\n\nIn both settings, we find that one can improve on the worst-subgroup error of ERM using the learned representations.\n\n*# It is not immediately clear why we would not expect classifier retraining/threshold correction (which as the author notes, are standard techniques) to work for the overparameterized setting? ... Could the authors better explain why overparameterization reduces our expectations on the effectiveness of these post-hoc procedures?*\n\nAs noted in the \u201cScope and contributions\u201d section (pg 2), the overparameterised setting can defeat techniques that might otherwise work in classical settings, e.g., standard distributionally robust optimisation (c.f. Sagawa et al. \u201820a). Thus, while our proposed idea of decoupling the learned representation and classifier is intuitive in hindsight, its success is not a-priori guaranteed. \n\nIn particular, the efficacy of such a technique is unclear given prior work, which established that the predictions of standard training in overparameterised settings leads to systematically biased predictions. These studies do not establish whether or not this bias is solely a function of the classification layer, or in fact pervades the learned representation too.\n\n*# The requirement of knowing the groups a priori seems rather significant. While one of their main cited works (Sagawa a) seems to have touched on group attribute mis-specification, this was not explored here -- how does having imprecise knowledge of the groups effect performance when using threshold correction or classifier retraining?*\n\nWe have included in Appendix A.1 results with the setting of imperfectly specified groups, per Sagawa et al. \u201820a, Appendix B. Specifically, we consider A = Wearing Lipstick x Eyeglasses x Smiling x Double Chin x Oval Face, which yields 64 subgroups of Y x A. In this setting, that threshold adjustment based on the subgroup frequencies can similarly improve the worst-subgroup error: this setting yields 16.67% worst-subgroup error, which is a modest increase compared to the 12.10% when using the exact subgroups.\n\n*# I have trouble fully understanding Figure 2 without a sense of what \"insufficient\" or poor representations would look like in a tSNE visualization.*\n\nIn a \u201cpoor\u201d representation, samples from the same class may not be clustered together: in particular, rare subgroups from one class may be closer to dominant samples from another class. Of course, this visualisation by itself does not establish the sufficiency of learning with the representations -- it is meant to provide some intuition for why the post-hoc correction techniques of the subsequent section can work.\n\n*# Does the nature of the attribute (land vs water, or hair color) have any effect on the observed poor worst-group performance, or are the results are mainly due to the fact that some groups are rarer than others? For example, would the authors expect similar results if y=male,female and A=blond,dark for celebA?*\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this very interesting suggestion. We have included in Appendix A.2 results when swapping the role of Y and A on CelebA. We find that there is an improvement in the baseline performance: the worst-subgroup error goes from 56.94% to 13.67%. Nonetheless, threshold adjustment can further reduce the worst-subgroup error.\n\nIn general, we expect that the choice of target Y and spurious attribute A plays an important role in final performance. Indeed, if the target variable is spuriously correlated with many other features in the training set, this could hamper performance. Thus, the problem is not purely one of certain subgroups being rare in the training set.\n\n*# Did the authors visualize the embeddings of models trained with DRO, to see whether there is any improvement in the learned representations ability to distinguish subgroups?*\n\nWe have included in Appendix B a plot of the embeddings learned under DRO. We find the separation is visually similar to what is seen under standard ERM. Note however that the slightly improved classification performance under DRO indicates that in the full representation space, there is greater inherent separability of the subgroups."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1977/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1977/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Overparameterisation and worst-case generalisation: friend or foe?", "authorids": ["~Aditya_Krishna_Menon1", "~Ankit_Singh_Rawat1", "~Sanjiv_Kumar1"], "authors": ["Aditya Krishna Menon", "Ankit Singh Rawat", "Sanjiv Kumar"], "keywords": ["overparameterisation", "worst-case generalisation"], "abstract": "Overparameterised neural networks have demonstrated the remarkable ability to perfectly fit training samples, while still generalising to unseen test samples.

Specifically, the paper demonstrates that this result is not necessarily due to overparameterized learning poor representations for rare subgroups, but rather mis-calibration in the classification layer that can be addressed with two simple correct techniques: thresholding and re-training the classification layer. They show improvements over ERM in worst-case subgroup error.  \n\nStrengths:  \n1. The paper is very well-written and easy to follow.\n2. The paper provides a better understanding of worst-case generalization in overparamaterized models by isolating the issue to the classification layer, which can help machine learning practitioners better understanding how they can address the issue of poor worst-group performance. \n\n\nWeaknesses:  \n1. The scope of the work seems largely limited to the set-up from Sagawa a, b. Given that all three datasets are simplified/synthetic (only one attribute, max. 4 subgroups), it would have been great to see how this paper's analysis applied to more complex settings.   \n2. It is not immediately clear why we would not expect classifier retraining/threshold correction (which as the author notes, are standard techniques) to work for the overparameterized setting? The richness of learned representations is well known, so in some sense the findings are not too surprising, especially given the simple (e.g. binary label) settings that make post-hoc corrections less complex. Could the authors better explain why overparameterization reduces our expectations on the effectiveness of these post-hoc procedures? \n3. The requirement of knowing the groups a priori seems rather significant. While one of their main cited works (Sagawa a) seems to have touched on group attribute mis-specification, this was not explored here -- how does having imprecise knowledge of the groups effect performance when using threshold correction or classifier retraining? \n4. I have trouble fully understanding Figure 2 without a sense of what \"insufficient\" or poor representations would look like in a tSNE visualization.  \n\n\nRecommendation:  \nI recommend acceptance. While I remain concerned about the limited scope of the experiments, I believe the paper adds valuable insights to the overall important topic of robustness / worst-case generalization.  \n\nQuestions:\n1. Does the nature of the attribute (land vs water, or hair color) have any effect on the observed poor worst-group performance, or are the results are mainly due to the fact that some groups are rarer than others?
