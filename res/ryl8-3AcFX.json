Despite this, the reviewer's agreed that the paper exceeds the bar for publication at ICLR. Hence, I recommend accept.\n\nBeyond the related work mentioned by the reviewers, the approach is similar to work in meta-learning. Meta-RL and multi-task learning has typically been considered in settings where the reward is changing (e.g. see [1],[2],[3],[4], where [4] also uses an embedding-based approach). However, there is some more recent work on meta-RL across varying dynamics, e.g. see [5],[6].

We will focus our response on the novelty of our paper and clarify some key contributions. \n\nNovelty in reward formulation compared to intrinsic motivation:\nFor an intrinsic motivation/curiosity reward, the reward would be the error in prediction. This would encourage the policy to explore unexplored regions of state space. However, in our work, the reward is the difference in prediction error of two models. The first model predicts directly while the second model is conditioned on EPI-trajectory. This is an important distinction which causes our EPI-policy to extract information to improve prediction and not explore. Using errors in prediction modelling as a surrogate for environment information gathering is to the best of our knowledge novel to our work. We attempted to highlight this difference in the last paragraph of our \u2018Related Work\u2019 section. However, we will further highlight this difference in the approach section.\n\nNovelty compared to UP-OSI (Yu et al. 2017):\nUP-OSI is an approach for explicit system identification. It takes in trajectories optimized for a specific task and tries to predict the environment parameters directly. But those trajectory to solve a task may not be optimal to disentangle to effects of different environment parameters (Lowrey et al. 2018). Hence this could make explicit prediction impractical for a large number of entangled environment parameters. \nInstead, our EPI policy is optimized to extract underlying parameters represented via embedding. This also reduces the burden of exactly disentangling the environment parameters, while providing sufficient information to learn a task. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that having a separate policy to extract embedding is a better strategy to get higher rewards. \n\nAblation studies:\nAs per your suggestion, we have run the ablation experiment without using any training tricks (i.e. \u201cNo Vine Data\u201d + \u201cNo Regularization\u201d). Hopper achieves 1237 pts which is 66 pts worse than using all the tricks. It however still beats all baselines. For the Striker, we get 0.324m final distance which is 0.162m worse than using all the tricks. Although we still beat 5/7 baselines, this is a significant loss in performance and highlights the importance of using both the Vine data and regularization. The ablation results of individual training tricks can be seen in Section 5.4.\n\nDescription of baselines:\nFor baselines, we will add more information in the Appendix. The MLP policies, baselines and our policy, has two hidden layers with 32 hidden units each with relu activations. This ensures that the capacity of the networks are the same. The Recurrent baseline is using an LSTM with 32 hidden units from rllab. All of these network sizes are defaults from the rllab toolbox. For the UP-OSI baseline, we followed the original paper and ran 5 iterations for training OSI.\n\nRelated work:\nWe thank the reviewer for this reference and we will include it in the Related Work section. \n\nThank you again for reviewing our paper. We would be happy to provide any further clarifications. We will upload an updated version of the paper with the appendix and more details in a few days.\n\nReferences:\nLowrey, Kendall, et al. \"Reinforcement learning for non-prehensile manipulation: Transfer from simulation to physical system.\" Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots (SIMPAR), 2018 IEEE International Conference on.

Interesting though limited novelty.", "review": "The submission presents a reinforcement learning method for exploring/probing the environment to determine an environment\u2019s properties and exploit these during later tasks. The method relies on jointly learning an embedding that simplifies prediction of future states and a policy that maximises a curiosity/intrinsic motivation like reward to learn to explore areas where the prediction model underperforms. In particular, the reward is based on the difference between prediction based on the learned embedding and prediction based on a prior collected dataset, such that the reward optimises to collect data with a large difference between the prediction accuracy of both models. The subsequently frozen policy and embedding are then used in other domains in a system identification like manner with the embedding utilised as input for a final task policy. The method is evaluated on a striker and hopper environment with varying dynamics parameters and shown to outperform a broad set of baselines. \n\nIn particular the broad set of baselines and small performed ablation study on the proposed method are quite interesting and beneficial for understanding the approach. However, the ablation study could be in more detail with respect to the additional training variations (Section 4.1.3; e.g. without all training tricks). Additionally, information about the baselines should be extended in the appendix as e.g. different capacities alone could have an impact where the performances of diff. algorithms are comparably similar. In particular, additional information about the training procedure for the UP-OSI (Yu et al 2017) baseline is required as the original approach relies on iterative training and it is unclear if the baseline implementation follows the original implementation (similar to Section 4.1.3.). \n\nOverall the submission provides an interesting new direction on learning system identification approaches, that while quite similar to existing work (Yu et al 2017), provides increased performance on two benchmark tasks. The contribution of the paper focuses on detailed evaluation and, overall, beneficial details of the proposed method. The novelty of the submission is however limited and highly similar to current methods.\n\nMinor issues:\n- Related work on learning system identification:\nLearning to Perform Physics Experiments via Deep Reinforcement Learning\nMisha Denil, Pulkit Agrawal, Tejas D Kulkarni, Tom Erez, Peter Battaglia, Nando de Freitas\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1174/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Environment Probing Interaction Policies", "abstract": "A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is environment generalization: a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the same task in a slightly different test environment.

Once this environment-specific information is obtained, it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these EPI-policies, we present a reward function based on transition predictability. Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the EPI-policy can be used to better predict transitions. We experimentally show that EPI-conditioned task-specific policies significantly outperform commonly used policy generalization methods on novel testing environments.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning"], "authorids": ["wenxuanz@andrew.cmu.edu", "lerrelp@andrew.cmu.edu", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu"], "authors": ["Wenxuan Zhou", "Lerrel Pinto", "Abhinav Gupta"], "pdf": "/pdf/9d31f3cd280f06954e882c622c7281af0188a4f2.pdf", "paperhash": "zhou|environment_probing_interaction_policies", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nzhou2018environment,\ntitle={Environment Probing Interaction Policies},\nauthor={Wenxuan Zhou and Lerrel Pinto and Abhinav Gupta},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryl8-3AcFX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper1174/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234288667, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "ryl8-3AcFX", "replyto": "ryl8-3AcFX", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1174/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335888944, "tmdate": 1552335888944, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1174/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
