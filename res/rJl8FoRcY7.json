However, I (and some of the reviewers) disagree with the motivation.  First of all, there's no reason one can't train a separate encoder for every combination of modalities available, at least when there are only 2 or 3.  Failing that, one could simple optimize per-example approximate posteriors without using an encoder.\n\nSecond, once you stop optimizing the ELBO, you've lost the motivating principle for training VAEs, and must justify your new objective empirically.  Almost all of the results are (in my opinion) ambiguous plots of latent encodings.\n\nFinally, a point made throughout the paper and discussions was that different modalities should give the same encodings, which is plainly false.  One of the reviewers made this point: \"The fact that z_a != z_b != z_{a,b} should be expected if a and b provide different information. I don't see the problem with this.\", which you dismiss.  Additionally, the encoder's job is to approximate the true posterior.  The true posteriors will in general be different for different modalities.\n\nI would recommend focusing on ways to train the original ELBO in the presence of different modalities, instead of modifying it based on these intuitions.\n", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "Poorly motivated, implications unclear"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Generative Models for learning Coherent Latent Representations from Multi-Modal Data", "abstract": "The application of multi-modal generative models by means of a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) is an upcoming research topic for sensor fusion and bi-directional modality exchange.\nThis contribution gives insights into the learned joint latent representation and shows that expressiveness and coherence are decisive properties for multi-modal datasets.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-modal VAE derived from the full joint marginal log-likelihood that is able to learn the most meaningful representation for ambiguous observations.\nSince the properties of multi-modal sensor setups are essential for our approach but hardly available, we also propose a technique to generate correlated datasets from uni-modal ones.\n", "keywords": ["Multi-Modal Deep Generative Models", "Sensor Fusion", "Data Generation", "VAE"], "authorids": ["korthals.timo@gmail.com", "mhesse@cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de", "juxi.leitner@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Timo Korthals", "Marc Hesse", "J\u00fcrgen Leitner"], "TL;DR": "Deriving a general formulation of a multi-modal VAE from the joint marginal log-likelihood.", "pdf": "/pdf/f7ef62afdafb97520c7b3ff7d6c5a3d3c0661367.pdf", "paperhash": "korthals|deep_generative_models_for_learning_coherent_latent_representations_from_multimodal_data", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkorthals2019deep,\ntitle={Deep Generative Models for learning Coherent Latent Representations from Multi-Modal Data},\nauthor={Timo Korthals and Marc Hesse and J\u00fcrgen Leitner},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl8FoRcY7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper445/Meta_Review", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": 1541548800000, "tmdate": 1545353214410, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"forum": "rJl8FoRcY7", "replyto": "rJl8FoRcY7", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.

Figure 2 \"proposed e-MNIST\") from which we can draw a joint sample \"a,b\"\nz_a: Is the projection of sample \"a\" using q_{\\phi_a} into the latent space\nz_b: vice versa\nz_{a,b}: Is the projection of the joint sample \"a,b\" using q_{\\phi_{a,b}} into the latent space\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------- Comment by the reviewer -----------------\n\"The fact that z_a != z_b != z_{a,b} should be expected if a and b provide different information. I don't see the problem with this.\"\n\n----------------- Answer by the authors -----------------\nThis statement is absolutely correct and holds if two datasets A and B don't show any correlation. This would also mean that both datasets have a different generative model. On the other hand, if the datasets share some information (for instants in the m-MNIST in Figure 2 where \"0\"s occur together with \"t-shirt\"s, \"7\"s together with \"heel\"s, etc.) they might also share the same generative model and therefore come frome the same latent representation. \n\nReferring to Figure 7, we trained q_{\\phi_{a}}, q_{\\phi_{b}}, and q_{\\phi_{a,b}} for the JMVAE-Zero, tVAE, and the proposed M\u00b2VAE on the AB dataset. Since we ensure a strong correlation not only per label but also per sample in the e-MNIST dataset, all q_{\\phi_*} should project any sample \"a\", \"b\", or \"a,b\" drawn from AB onto the same latent representation, resulting in z_a = z_b = z_{a,b}. If this is not the case, the VAE was not able to find the common generative model.\n\nA disjoint latent space example can be seen in the latent space of the JMVAE-Zero (top of Figure 7), where the projections of q_{\\phi_{a}} and q_{\\phi_{b}} are entirely disjoint. Furthermore, the projections from q_{\\phi_{a,b}} share a vague similarity with q_{\\phi_{a}}. However, sampling from that confused latent space via p_{\\theta_{a}} and p_{\\theta_{b}} results in bad reconstruction.\n\nOn the other hand, the tVAE finds a more congruent latent space projection via q_{\\phi_{a}}, q_{\\phi_{b}}, and q_{\\phi_{a,b}}. But it also shows no clear seperation between labels (green, violet, and pink are strongly confused).\n\nFinally, our model finds the most coherent and congruent latent space projection of AB by its' encoders q_{\\phi_{a}}, q_{\\phi_{b}}, and q_{\\phi_{a,b}}. Furthermore, they show the clearest separability and best reconstructability.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------- Comment by the reviewer -----------------\n\"The model learned by tVAE is derived from the JMLL. q(z|a) and q(z|b) are learned separately from the model.\"\n\n----------------- Answer by the authors -----------------\nThat is correct. But the separate learning of q(z|a) and q(z|b) is what we consider as a \"not fully analytical derivation\". The training of q(z|a) and q(z|b) has no impact on shaping the latent space and also not on the joint encoder q(z|a,b).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------- Comment by the reviewer -----------------\n\"Didn't you say that tVAE and JMVAE-Zero were not derived from the JMLL, yet you compared to them? So you could also compare to JMVAE-kl given how similar it is to your model. Right?\"\n\n----------------- Answer by the authors -----------------\nWe apologize for confusing the reviewer with too implicit information. We consider the M\u00b2VAE as \"fully derived\" from the JMLL while tVAE and JMVAE-Zero are just \"derived\" utilizing the JMLL as a starting point. \n\nHowever, you are right with the fact that the JMVAE-kl is indeed similar to ours it is, therefore, worth comparing it against the other approaches. We will include the evaluations in our future publications but also want to forecast that the missing uni-modal reconstruction terms in the loss function result in noticeable confusion if uni-modal observations are incomplete (as in our MoG example)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Generative Models for learning Coherent Latent Representations from Multi-Modal Data", "abstract": "The application of multi-modal generative models by means of a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) is an upcoming research topic for sensor fusion and bi-directional modality exchange.\nThis contribution gives insights into the learned joint latent representation and shows that expressiveness and coherence are decisive properties for multi-modal datasets.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-modal VAE derived from the full joint marginal log-likelihood that is able to learn the most meaningful representation for ambiguous observations.\nSince the properties of multi-modal sensor setups are essential for our approach but hardly available, we also propose a technique to generate correlated datasets from uni-modal ones.\n", "keywords": ["Multi-Modal Deep Generative Models", "Sensor Fusion", "Data Generation", "VAE"], "authorids": ["korthals.timo@gmail.com", "mhesse@cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de", "juxi.leitner@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Timo Korthals", "Marc Hesse", "J\u00fcrgen Leitner"], "TL;DR": "Deriving a general formulation of a multi-modal VAE from the joint marginal log-likelihood.", "pdf": "/pdf/f7ef62afdafb97520c7b3ff7d6c5a3d3c0661367.pdf", "paperhash": "korthals|deep_generative_models_for_learning_coherent_latent_representations_from_multimodal_data", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkorthals2019deep,\ntitle={Deep Generative Models for learning Coherent Latent Representations from Multi-Modal Data},\nauthor={Timo Korthals and Marc Hesse and J\u00fcrgen Leitner},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl8FoRcY7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper445/Official_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1543621621586, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"forum": "rJl8FoRcY7", "replyto": null, "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"]}, "signatures": {"description": "", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Authors|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Area_Chair[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "required": true}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper445/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "noninvitees": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1543621621586}}}, {"id": "Hyx27qIj6X", "original": null, "number": 6, "cdate": 1542314532038, "ddate": null, "tcdate": 1542314532038, "tmdate": 1542314532038, "tddate": null, "forum": "rJl8FoRcY7", "replyto": "S1gTGBq-67", "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper445/Official_Comment", "content": {"title": "Response", "comment": "\"in a bi-modal case, i.e. q_\\phi_a(z_a|a), q_\\phi_b(z_b|b), and q_\\phi_{a,b}(z_{a,b}|a,b), may project the observations into different latent spaces (z_a != z_b != z_{a,b})\"\n\nThe fact that z_a != z_b != z_{a,b} should be expected if a and b provide different information.

We hope our responses below may help clarify the scope of our work and its significance.\n\n1. The original JMVAE proposed by Suzuki et al. [1] does, in fact, optimize the bound of the VI log(p(a|b))+log(p(b|a)) as derived in the appendix A of their work [1]. Further, they derive the ELBO for the VI by substituting the reconstruction terms by the ELBO of the joint multi-modal VAE.\n\n2. Given 1., we can substitute log p(a|b) + log p(b|a) with L_m. But in fact, there is a typo in eq. (4) & (5) which definitely causes confusion. The left-hand-side (LHS) term should be L_m\u00b2, denoting the proposed VAE, and not L_m (which denotes the VAE by Suzuki et al.).\n\n3. As explained in 2. and by correcting the typo in the LHS term, the bounds are correct. We apologize for this confusion and upload a corrected version of the paper. (Origin of the issue: we used the superscript symbol 2 which was dropped by the LaTeX compiler)\n\n4. In fact, beta tuning is pretty robust as shown by Higgins et al. [2]. One only has to care about the proper ratios between the size of the observable and latent dimensions as briefly explained by us: \u201c... our main concern is the balance between the input (D) and the latent space (Dz) using a constant normalized factor \u03b2norm=\u03b2D/Dz.\u201d\n\n5. As we do not know if this statement relates to our proposed M\u00b2VAE (section 3) or the multi-modal data generation via the CVAE (section 4.1), we try to answer this concern two-fold: 5.a relates to the approach of our proposed M\u00b2VAE model while 5.b relates to the correlated data generation via the CVAE.\n\n5.a. From our point of view, current VAE approaches do not explicitly care or investigate the coherence of the latent space in multi-modal cases. Thus, the encoder networks for example in a bi-modal case, i.e. q_\\phi_a(z_a|a), q_\\phi_b(z_b|b), and q_\\phi_{a,b}(z_{a,b}|a,b), may project the observations into different latent spaces (z_a != z_b != z_{a,b}). This happens for the tVAE and JMVAE-Zero, as qualitatively shown in our results, due to the fact that these approaches do not maintain a fully analytical way for deriving the VAE\u2019s objective from the joint marginal log-likelihood (JMLL). In our work, the VAE\u2019s objective has been consequently derived from the JMLL which also disproves statements in related papers, which state that this approach is not applicable. As a result, our model shows coherence in the latent spaces (z_a = z_b = z_{a,b}) regarding the sampled latent space as well as the ELBO for each sample which is, from our point of view, a significant and unique finding in the field of multi-modal generative models. Furthermore, the trained latent space should serve as a much better representation, i.e. feature extractor for subsequent models, which is out of scope for this contribution.\n\n5.b. We found that current available multi-modal datasets do not satisfy our needs to show the significance of our M\u00b2VAE approach. As stated in our contribution, multi-modal data for e.g. sensor fusion should show a correlation. Available datasets [3] may hold this requirement, but may be too complex in nature to qualitatively prove the distinction between SOTA VAEs and our proposed M\u00b2VAE. Therefore, we proposed a technique to correlate different datasets (MNITS and fashion-MNIST in our case) by superimposing the latent space of distinctively trained CVAEs. The simultaneous sampling from the various CVAE decoders then produces a correlated dataset, that allows us to show the benefits of our approach.\nIf one would just feed for instance MNIST and f-MNIST into a multi-modal VAE, even by keeping the labels the same, the VAE would train an orthogonal distribution per label. This shows that if one feeds uncorrelated data into any VAE, the VAE will obtain the uncorrelatedness as shown in Figure 2 Bottom-Left. One can see that per label, almost all distributions remain orthogonal to each other, which proves our assumption. However, sampling from that latent space will again result in uncorrelated data.\nOn the other hand, a multi-modal VAE is able to obtain the correlation of the proposed sampled dataset e-MNIST, which suites our needs for further evaluations in this contribution. \nHowever, we would be very thankful if the reviewer could point out the literature to the named models (VAE-CCA or JMVAE) which investigate similar nature in VAEs.\n\n6. As stated in 5.a and 5.b our main objective is to show that our model learns a correct coherent latent space between modalities. However, we would be again very thankful if the reviewer could point out datasets which satisfy the needs for sensor-fusion as well as the necessary complexity to improve the visibility of our work.\n\n[1] Suzuki, M., et al.

The re-visit of JMVAE seems not precise. The JMVAE should bound the joint p(a, b) not log p(a|b)p(b|a).\n2. Due to the potential misunderstanding of JMVAE, the paper uses the JMVAE bound for log p(a|b) + log p(b|a) in equation (5), which seems wrong. \nEquation (4) &(5) itself seems confusing alone. It says L_m = log p(a,b) in (4) then L_m = log p(a|b) + log p(b|a) in (5).\n3. If I am not mistaken the error above, the proposed bound is in fact wrong. \n4. Assume that the method is correct, with a massive amount of beta:s, I doubt the method would be very sensitive to beta tuning. The experiments just presented some examples of different betas. Quantitive evaluation of beta and performance is needed. \n5. To generate multi-modal data, other methods such as VAE-CCA or JMVAE are able to that as well. It is not unique to the proposed method. \n6. The experiments are very toyish. The multi-modal data were generated. The method should be evaluated with a real-world benchmarking multi-modal dataset.

Clarity could be improved.", "review": "\nThis paper proposes an objective, M^2VAE, for multi-modal VAEs, which is supposed to learn a more meaningful latent space representation. To summarize my understanding of the proposed objective, in the bi-modal case, it combines both objectives of TELBO [1] and JMVAE-kl [2] with some hyperparameters to learn the uni-modal encoders. The terms of Eqns 7,8, and 9 are equivalent to TELBO and Eqns 9 and 10 are JMVAE-kl. It would be very beneficial for the readers if you could more clearly contrast your objective with the related work given how similar they are. \n\nGiven these similarities between objectives, its unclear why JMVAE-Zero was chosen over JMVAE-kl as a baseline. Furthermore, the reasoning for the improvement of the ELBO of M^2VAE over the baselines in Section 5.3 is unclear, given the similarities between the objectives. \n\nThe qualitative figures throughout the paper are hard to interpret. By looking at Fig 4., I cannot tell which latent space is best. \n\u201cone can see from Fig. 4 that the most coherent latent space distribution was learned by the proposed M^2VAE\u201d \nWhat is meant by \u2018coherent latent space\u2019? \n\nThis paper was hard to follow and there are a number of typos throughout the paper. For instance, the labels within Fig 4 and the caption contradict themselves. If the clarity and quality of the writing could be improved then perhaps the contributions may become more evident.  \n\n[1] R. Vedantam, I. Fischer, J. Huang, and K. Murphy.
