To ensure tractability in the harder case with a non-conjugate likelihood, we were forced to use sparse variational inference with 1,000 inducing points chosen randomly from the training set.  (Though we expect that carefully optimized code exploiting the GPU for matrix inverses could solve the full problem in the non-conjugate setting).  The resulting calibration curves were close to the diagonal, indicating accurate uncertainty estimation.  We compared to a GP with an RBF kernel in the same setting, which gave a similarly good calibration curve, but worse test error (3.4% vs 2.4%).\n\nAs regards hyper-parameter optimization, it is important to note that our best architecture, the ResNet GP, was not optimized *at all*, we simply used the 32-layer ResNet architecture directly, replacing the final average-pooling layer with a dense layer.  For the lower-performing architectures (ConvNet GP and Residual CNN GP), we followed Lee et al. (2017) in randomly sampling hyperparameters including e.g. the number of layers, and selected the network with the best validation error.\n\nRegarding scalability (as we discuss above in our response to reviewer 1), inverting the kernel matrix takes around a minute (though this can be reduced further by using MAGMA with multiple GPUs), whereas computing the kernel matrix takes longer.  Critically, however, computing the kernel matrix is embarassingly parallel, so can be speeded up arbitrarily given sufficiently many GPU's.  In contrast, neural network training is an inherently sequential computation, and as such improving training speed with additional GPU's remains an active research topic.  Considering the question of practical applicability more broadly, it is important to make two points.  First, we agree that there is a need for approximations schemes that are effective in the large-scale neural network domain, and we look forward to future research on this topic.  Second, the Gaussian process solves a *really* hard problem: exact inference over all the parameters in an infinitely wide, multilayer ResNet.  It is pretty shocking (to us at least) that this problem is tractable at all.  In contrast, doing full-gradient HMC for a finite version of this network would be practically impossible.\n\nWe have added a new section in the Appendix, which describes how to extend the results in Matthews et al 2018b to our case.\n\nMinor comments:\n* Thanks, fixed.\n* If we didn't decrease the weights as we increased the number of channels, then the neural network outputs would blow up as we increased the number of channels, because the outputs would be the sum of an increasingly large number of terms.

However, it is important to note that this only occurs in restricted circumstances.  In particular, weight-sharing introduces correlations across different locations in a single feature map.  It turns out that in many cases, you can design neural network priors with kernels that don't depend on these correlations, and that's what we do.  However, for many neural networks, the correlations (and hence the weight sharing) will be relevant.  For instance, if we use any type of pooling (such as average pooling at the output), then we would require the correlations within the feature maps, and hence we would need to take into account covariances and hence weight sharing throughout the whole network.\n- We agree that a comparison of the performance of finite and infinite CNNs as regards the loss-function, and the number of layers is important.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to satisfy ourselves that we had a thorough, completely fair comparison in the available time, given the many choices available for SGD, so we'll restrict ourselves to three observations here.  First, using proper likelihoods rather than the squared loss function in the GP appears to give little or no improvement in test error, though this may be because we need additional approximations. Second, depth is critical to achieving higher performance, with shallower architectures such as our ConvNet GP and Residual CNN GP (with a maximum of 16 layers) achieving a test error of around 1.0%, as opposed to 0.84% with a deeper 32 layer ResNet.  Third, while our architecture is very similar to a ResNet (the only real difference being the replacement of average pooling at the last layer with a dense layer), the performance does not equal that of state-of-the-art residual networks. A thorough investigation of this phenomenon will form an important avenue for future research.\n\nSuggestions:\nWe have given a more thorough discussion of the results, including by introducing Table 1 in the Experiments section.  We've also added a section to the appendix which extends the proofs in Matthews et al. (2018b) to the convolutional case.\n\nSmall questions/comments:\n- Thanks: fixed.\n- Thanks: fixed.\n- Even for multivariate regression, this is true: the output channels, not locations correspond to different classes.  We have clarified this in the text.  It would also be interesting to think about image-scale outputs, which would correspond to e.g. classifying each pixel/region in an image.\n- We need the covariances across data at all corresponding locations in the in the feature map.

Some theoretical justifications about the correspondence between GPs and convolutional networks with infinitely many channels are provided.\n2. The formulas for GP kernel computation for the considered network is provided and some experiments are conducted (on MNIST).\n\nI personally enjoy the ideas of the close relation between certain types of neural networks and GPs and I really like the idea of authors that kernels based on convolutional networks might be more practical compared to the ones based on fully connected networks. It might be easier to encode certain invariance for complex objects via multilayered structures then via more simple explicit kernels.\n\nHowever, I see couple of important issues:\n1. The theoretical justification provided is basically heuristic argument and, speaking rigorously, is not a theorem. The proper proof should be based not on layer-by-layer convergence, but on the convergence with all the parameters tending simultaneously to infinity (see Matthews et al, 2018). Also, I doubt that the limit with infinite number of channels is as meaningful as the limit with infinite width of layer, as wide networks are used much more often in practice than networks with many channels.\n2. The practical applicability is very limited as the kernel obtained has very high computational complexity. The authors theirselves comment that computing kernel matrix takes more time than inverting it. Thus, the applicability beyond MNIST is a big question for the proposed approach.\n\nTo sum up, I think that the present paper targets an important direction of work, but the contribution itself is somehow limited (and relative obvious based on the recent papers on relation between fully connected networks and GPs).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper601/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Convolutional Networks as shallow Gaussian Processes", "abstract": "We show that the output of a (residual) CNN with an appropriate prior over the weights and biases is a GP in the limit of infinitely many convolutional filters, extending similar results for dense networks.

It shows that this covariance function can be computed efficiently (when compared to previous attempts at resembling convolutional networks with GPs), with a cost that only depends linearly on the number of layers and the input dimensionality, i.e.~O(N^2 L D). \n\nTo show the equivalence between deep CNNs and shallow GPs, the paper uses similar ideas to those proposed by Matthews et al (2018a) and Lee et al (2017), i.e. using the multivariate central limit theorem in very large networks, where in the case of this paper the limit is taken as the number of channels at each layer goes to infinity. Therefore, from a theoretical perspective, these ideas have been proposed before. However, the paper presents a novel efficient way to compute the convolutional kernel, which I believe has merits on its own. \n\nHowever, the model setting for classification (where deep CNNs have been successful) and consequent evaluation on the MNIST dataset is less than convincing. One of the main motivations for Bayesian CNNs and GPs (and the paper argue for this in the intro) is to be able to provide good uncertainty estimates. However, the classification problem is framed in a regression setting, where neither probabilistic estimates are evaluated or even provided. Indeed, only the error rate is given on Table 1. To me, this is certainly not enough for a Bayesian/GP method and it is a critical deficiency of the paper in its current form. While I understand having a non-Gaussian likelihood will complicate things and conflate the kernel contribution with the approximations, I believe it is necessary to provide and evaluate such probabilistic estimates and compare them to other GP approaches (even using other less than satisfying methods such as calibration/scaling). Along a similar vein, it is unclear what objective function was used for hyper-parameter learning but, given that the authors actually \u201csample hyper-parameters\u201d, I am guessing a proper probabilistic objective such as the marginal likelihood is out of the question.\n\nOther (perhaps minor) deficiencies is that the method is not scalable to large datasets (I am even surprised the authors managed to run this on full MNIST) and that no theoretical analysis is done (e.g. as in Mattews et al, 2018a). \n\nMinor comments:\n\n* In the intro, \u201cOther methods such as Gaussian Processes\u201d: GPs are not a method and I believe the authors really mean here Gaussian process regression. \n* The prior variance over filters in Eq (3) divides over the number of channels.
