In MNIST, the proposed method is worse than data augmentation. In CIFAR-10, the proposed method does perform better, however, \\tilde{N} for data augmentation is chosen as 2, which is too small in my opinion. The data augmentation's robustness is similar to the baseline. I don't know if there are any issues in the training but data augmentation with \\tilde{N}=2 is expected to be ineffective to improve robustness. For CIFAR-100, the improvement is marginal and can only be achieved when \\sigma is large.\n\nIs the GNR score in Table 1 calculated on all examples or only on correctly classified examples? If it is calculated on all examples, I think it would be better to also report the result of the correctly classified examples. Because at the end we care how the models can correctly and robustly make the classification.\n\nI think it would be better if the authors can have some discussion about the potential connections between the proposed method and the method in [1]. [1] proved that if a model can classify well under Gaussian noise, it is possible to turn it into a classifier that is certifiably robust (I don't think the proposed method is certifiable) to adversarial perturbations in l_2 ball. The training method in [1] is Gaussian data augmentation. An experimental comparison between the proposed method and the method in [1] is necessary. I am not sure how faster the proposed method can be. \n\n[1] Cohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

However, I am not convinced that the proposed method is highly effective (Table 1 and Figure 3) and I still think the contribution is kind of marginal (especially given [1]).

In MNIST, it would be the point on the purple line ($\\tilde{N} = 21$) at $\\sigma = 0.325$ in Figure 3(a). It is clearly an outlier since we conjecture that this amount of augmentation is enough for MNIST, a relatively low-dimensional data, with this noise level. In CIFAR10, augmentation hurts the accuracy dramatically, and the model that maintained the closest accuracy to the baseline was with $\\tilde{N} = 21$. In CIFAR100, the improvement of our regularizer is significant relative to the improvement of the best data augmentation.\n- robustness score\n    We calculate the GNR score on all examples but with the prediction of the model for the clean input image instead of the ground-truth prediction.\n- connection to [1]\n    Thank you for your reference. Indeed, [1] is very relevant to our setup. To perform $\\ell_2$ certification, it is necessary to train a base classifier that can classify Gaussianaly corrupted samples correctly. The authors were restricted to performing data augmentation, and as pointed out by authors, this is a suboptimal choice due to reasons that sampling from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})$ results into samples with an average energy that scales with the dimension of the input. This results into severe difficulties in training. Therefore, our approach with the analytical moment regularizer provides a powerful alternative towards building such a classifier surpassing any need for data augmentation. This is an exciting line of work that we will investigate in a future direction.

There has been a large amount of literature on training robust network, but they are also for the robustness to adversarial examples. The Gaussian noise is too simple and easy to defend. We can even apply a simple denoiser to preprocess the data, which does not even involve training a sophisticated neural network.\n\n(2) The proposed moment regularizer is very delicate. I do not think it can generalize to other noises or contaminations. This is because for other noises, the moment approximation can be fairly loose.\n\n(3) The Alexnet was proposed in 2011.

Specifically, the authors analyze the analytic expression of the loss on the noisy inputs, and using Jensen\u2019s inequality, propose to minimize a surrogate loss over the expectation of noisy inputs. To minimize the loss over the expectation, the authors impose a regularization over the first moment of the network weights. The authors validate the model with the proposed regularization technique for its robustness against Gaussian attack and other types of attacks, whose results show that the model is robust. \n\nPros\n- The general idea of the regularization that replaces the generation of noisy samples and optimization over it is conceptually appealing and seems practically useful.\n- The derivation of the moment-based regularization makes sense. \n- The proposed regularizer seems to be effective to a certain degree, on the sets of experiments done by the authors.\n\nCons\n- Experimental validation seems highly inadequate due to lack of baselines. Thus it is difficult to assess the degree of robustness the proposed model achieves. The authors should perform extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art techniques against multiple types of attacks, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- While the authors emphasize the computational efficiency of the method, the authors do not report computational cost or actual runtime.  \n- The types of non-Gaussian attacks should be better described. Which ones use L-infinity attacks and which use L2 attacks?\n- Figure 3 doesn\u2019t seem like a very favorable result to the proposed model, since we are generally more concerned with adversarial examples generated with small perturbations, as large perturbations may change the input semantics.\n\nIn sum, while I like the overall idea and find the work novel and potentially practical, it is difficult to properly evaluate the work due to lack of comparison against state-of-the-art data augmentation methods for achieving robustness. Therefore I temporarily give this paper a weak reject, but may change the rating with more experimental results provided in the rebuttal.

We conduct extensive experiments on LeNet and AlexNet on various datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed regularizer. In particular, we show that networks that are trained with the proposed regularizer benefit from a boost in robustness against Gaussian noise to an equivalent amount of performing 3-21 folds of noisy data augmentation. Moreover, we empirically show on several architectures and datasets that improving robustness against Gaussian noise, by using the new regularizer, can improve the overall robustness against 6 other types of attacks by two orders of magnitude.", "pdf": "/pdf/49aa146261ded92b6fa112444b84b290b0ab0a3b.pdf", "code": "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Pb3zfGnp6y-YgE7-gyh3qz7zykorClU5", "paperhash": "alfadly|analytical_moment_regularizer_for_training_robust_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/49aa146261ded92b6fa112444b84b290b0ab0a3b.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nalfadly2020analytical,\ntitle={Analytical Moment Regularizer for Training Robust Networks},\nauthor={Modar Alfadly and Adel Bibi and Muhammed Kocabas and Bernard Ghanem},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1xDq2EFDH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
