For an input pair of images, the task is to match the unannotated (but given as part of the input) keypoints. The main contribution is identifying the bottleneck of the current SOTA algorithm: a fixed connectivity construction given by Delauney triangulation. By replacing this with an end-to-end learnable algorithm, they outperform SOTA with a decent margin.\n\nContribution & significance: The topic of discrete keypoint matching has had a lot of progress in the last five years and is gaining attention even from more product-oriented branches of computer vision. The benchmarks used for evaluation (PASCAL-VOC, SPair71k) are, in fact, quite difficult, and even 2-3 points of progress require non-trivial effort. The core insight of improving this particular part of the pipeline is creative and novel. In these regards, the paper certainly meets the bar set for ICLR.\n\nExperiments are conducted thoroughly and on multiple standard datasets. I appreciate the ablation study. Minor suggestions are below.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1) **Code**  For a mostly experimental paper, it is imperative to release code (as is also common in the line of work for keypoint matching). If the code was already uploaded, I would have given the paper a higher rating.\n\n2) **Co-generative model** The authors for some reason insist on this interpretation of their architecture (it appears in boldface in the abstract). In practical terms, it means that a) one term of the loss function doesn't depend on ground truth b) a reparametrization trick is used. I do not think, this justifies making the co-generative a central point of the paper. In my eyes, it would simply help the paper if these remarks were removed.\n\n3) **Relevance for wider ICLR community** Given the very specialized domain, the work would perhaps be a better fit for a conference fully focused on computer vision. Note that e.g. (Fey, ICLR 2020) included also NLP experiments and made a more general point about matching procedures. I am afraid that in the current form, this paper won't attract too wide ICLR audiences. Is there a way to demonstrate/make-a-plausible-case-for wider applicability?\n\n4) **At times unclear writeup** It wasn't always easy to understand what exactly the authors mean. Both in natural language and in technical parts. In the technical parts, the authors use very heavy notation and produce multiple large formulas that on the other have very standard content (e.g.. eq 11 and 14). On a technical level, the tools applied to introducing differentiability are very standard.  But that is absolutely fine since the core contribution is **where** they are applied.  There is no need to \"produce enough formulas\" such as by rewriting standard ELBO arguments over much larger notation (as it is in Appendix A3).\n\n5) **Qualitative analysis** This is a missed opportunity. High-quality images that clearly demonstrate where the advantage is coming from, could easily be a highlight of this paper and should certianly be present in the main text. The current analysis in the supplementary is quite short and the displayed images are tiny, very hard to understand and **in almost all cases do NOT show the difference between the baseline and the proposed method.** I can't stress enough how instructive it would be to insert a section where eg. only examples of tables are analyzed (since that's the class with maximum gain) and one can clearly see what the architecture does differently (without zooming to 400%). Some parts of the technical presentation could be shortened.\n\nMinor remarks follow:\n- line 4 - footnote: It only is without loss of generality when negative costs are allowed, otherwise the argmax is always a maximal matching and outliers are not ignored.\n- line 4 (LaTeX): This symbol for real numbers is very non-standard\n- Figure 1 is hard to navigate. I suggest just focusing on the topology and dropping the matchings.\n- page 3 - summation itself is undifferentiable - this is more misleading than anything. The point of this section is that one can introduce soft edges instead of the hard edges.\n- page 4 - consistency loss - This needs an example or a figure for an explanation.\n- page 4 - with full linearization (Swoboda, 2007) - This work doesn't linearize anything as far as I know. It is a SOTA combinatorial QAP solver based on message passing and dual ascent.\n- Eq 11, I don't see any reason to include this. it is just a trivial factorization with heavy notation.\n- Page 7, Figure 3 has poor visual quality and a very tiny font.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper172/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper172/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Latent Topology for Graph Matching", "authorids": ["~Tianshu_Yu2", "~Runzhong_Wang1", "~Junchi_Yan2", "~Baoxin_Li1"], "authors": ["Tianshu Yu", "Runzhong Wang", "Junchi Yan", "Baoxin Li"], "keywords": ["Graph matching", "generative graph model", "latent structure learning"], "abstract": "Graph matching (GM) has been traditionally modeled as a deterministic optimization problem characterized by an affinity matrix under pre-defined graph topology.

Upon the remaining concerns, our responses are as follows:\n\n1. **Code.** We are now working on some new idea based on this submission, and trying to organize the code and release it within the decision period. However, at the current stage, we also wish reviewers can consider other factors (e.g. novelty, insight, motivation, theoretical soundness, improvement, etc.) when evaluating our paper.\n\n2. **What really works.** In general, changing the topology not only affects the topology itself ($N_G$ in Fig. 2(a)), it also influences any other modules ($N_R$ and $N_B$ in Fig. 2(a)) since the framework is an end-to-end fashion (not step-by-step). In this sense, the learned node and edge features in both $N_R$ and $N_B$ can become more deterministic for matching task. The significant improvement on simple object \"table\" (where the topology generated from our module $N_G$ can be very similar to Delaunay) can be derived from such deterministic features by allowing new topology on complex object \"human\". So we infer that the latent topology can somewhat release some capacity of the whole network for complex object (e.g. human), and allow the released capacity to focus on objects with more ambiguity (e.g. table). The reason of this phenomenon is still unclear, and is related to a more essential question: **How the (latent) topology influences the feature learning in GNN backbones.** We will cover this topic in our future work. In summary, the latent topology is not produced occasionally, but **learned** by the network under some prior. Please also see ablation study in Appendix A.4, where we turn on different loss functions. We can suppose the performance from an occasionally created topology will not be affected by different loss functions, but we did observe each loss function can consistently improve the performance. This shows that the topology is not occasionally generated.\n\nThank you again for the discussion and look forward to your reply."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper172/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper172/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Latent Topology for Graph Matching", "authorids": ["~Tianshu_Yu2", "~Runzhong_Wang1", "~Junchi_Yan2", "~Baoxin_Li1"], "authors": ["Tianshu Yu", "Runzhong Wang", "Junchi Yan", "Baoxin Li"], "keywords": ["Graph matching", "generative graph model", "latent structure learning"], "abstract": "Graph matching (GM) has been traditionally modeled as a deterministic optimization problem characterized by an affinity matrix under pre-defined graph topology.

We also appreciate that the reviewer recognized the novelty of our work. Our answers to the main concerns of the reviewer are as follows:\n\n1. **Problem definition.** Actually the definition of learning-based graph matching under a learnable fashion (in our setting) can be found in Eq. (2), which is to estimate the matching with maximal probability given pairs of input graphs. Compared to a deterministic modeling of graph matching in Eq. (1), Eq. (2) adopts a learnable parameter $\\theta$ which is more appropriate under a learning-based setting. In general, following the convention in graph neural networks [1], we denote $A\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n\\times n}$ a topology of an $n$-node graph, where $A_{ij}=1$ indicates that there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise. We will clarify these in our updated version to avoid any ambiguity to the readers. A normalized connectivity is a connectivity matrix with each row normalized by the degree of the corresponding node (see Eq. (23) in Appendix A.2 with normalized value $1/|\\mathcal{N}(i)|$).\n2. **Graph without edges.** Graph without any edges will lead to bipartite matching, which is a subset of graph matching [2]. Compared to more general graph matching with edges, bipartite matching will sometimes result in the ambiguity of nodes, yielding low robustness [2]. However, it is shown in several papers that incorporating edges (topology) is helpful to the learning-based framework to fully exploit local geometrical constraints and eliminate this ambiguity to some extent [3,4]. Therefore, we mainly focus on graph matching problem with explicit topological structure.\n3. **ELBO gaurantee.** Actually, Eq. (13) is derived from standard EM setting, except for incorporating several priors which do not have any influence on the convergence of the whole algorithm. As stated by reviewer5, the EM algorithm we utilized is standard and the contribution is where it is applied. Therefore, we omitted to rewrite the non-informative proof which can be easily found in the literature [5].\n4. **Quality of generated topology.** Reviewer is referred to Fig. 3 which demonstrates the quality of the generated topology. We show two criteria of topology along with the epoch: 1) level of isomorphism of generated topology pairs (in terms of Eq.

We response the reviewer from the following perspectives (where most of the answers can be found from the paper):\n\n1. **Motivation.** Our idea of the paper starts from questioning if a fixed topology is suitable for a specific task (i.e. graph matching) as stated at the end of the first page. By establishing the hypothesis that there exists more suitable latent topology, we propose a method to learn it, and then verify the correctness of our hypothesis via extensive experiments. This is a process of \u201cestablishing hypothesis then verifying it\u201d. Therefore, we didn\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d there must be a more suitable latent topology, instead we \u201cconclude\u201d clues from experiments which agree with our hypothesis.\n2. **Fundamentals about graph matching.** $Hz=1$ does ensure a one-to-one matching when $H$ is a selection matrix and this fact has been well studied in [1,2]. In fact, as long as the model is differentiable with gradients (whenever exact gradient or gradient estimator), our method can work. In our implementation, as the black-block combinatorial solver with gradient estimator [3] is employed, the output $Z$ is indeed discrete. However,  a continuous $z_i\\in [0,1]$ with exact gradient also works (e.g. [4]) and can fit into our framework. In general, our method is indifferent with the format of $Z$. A normalized connectivity is a connectivity matrix with each row normalized by the degree of the corresponding node (see Eq. (23) in Appendix A.2 with normalized value $1/|\\mathcal{N}(i)|$).\n3. **About the improvement.** In fact, we employed a completely identical state-of-the-art graph matching network structure as in [1], except for the latent topology inferring module (see $N_G$ in Fig. 1(a) and Sec 2.1). Even by only introducing this minor change, we can still achieve significant improvement (around 3%-4%) over the current state-of-the-art method [4] on challenging datasets (Pascal VOC and SPair-71K). As stated by reviewer5, these two datasets are very challenging and even an improvement around 2% is non-trival. We believe this fact is sufficiently convincing to show that the performance gain is from novel latent topology module, rather than other factors (e.g. model complexity and feature richness). \n4. **Other gradient estimators and generative models.** Straight-through operator and the current graph generative model are adopted taking into account efficiency and simplicity. While our paper is focusing on investigating the validity of the latent topology (and its distribution), existing experimental results already can strongly support our claim and examining different combinations of basic settings is out of our scope. However, we would like to add some trials with various combinations if space and time permit.\n5. **Independence prior.** Actually this prior is to ensure that we can use an identical neural network to model or extract features from two different input graphs. This is a common practice in almost all lines of deep graph matching methods [4,5,6], similar to Siamese networks. This procedure can greatly simplify the model complexity. In Eq. (15), we give an interpretation of such convention under a probabilistic setting. It is unnecessary and impractical to conduct tests without this prior.\n6. **Discrete topology $\\underline{\\mathbf{A}}$.** Indeed, our latent topology module generates discrete topology in either deterministic or generative settings. However, our method can also easily integrate soft-assignment since it is fully differentiable. The reason we focus on the discrete case is that, since our hypothesis is about the discrete topology (and its distribution) itself, the algorithm we design should consistently align our hypothesis. Using continuous soft-assignment may possibly improve the performance, but it will also bring confusion to readers: if our claim or hypothesis is really supported by any evidence. We will consider soft-assignment in our future work.\n\nWe thank the reviewer again and look forward to further discussion.\n\n[1] F. Zhou and F. Torre. Factorized graph matching.

Our answers to the main concerns of the reviewer are as follows:\n1. **Relevance to ICLR.** The reason that our experiments were conducted on computer vision tasks is because of the high quality and significant challenge of datasets in CV (e.g. Pascal VOC and SPair-71K). While the design of our method is not particularly for CV, we believe the main idea (of learning latent topology of structural data) is also helpful to several relevant tasks. In fact, several recent important papers on graph matching were also mainly focused on computer vision datasets [1,2] while have their counterparts in other non-CV problems (e.g. graph similarity [3] and Wassertein learning [4]). \n2. **Qualitative analysis.** As suggested by the reviewer, we will add clearer and bigger figures in the updated version.\n3. **Code.** We will release the source code once the paper can be accepted.\n4. **Previous works.** Actually, we didn\u2019t find any previous work for graph matching by estimating the latent topology as in our paper. We used \u201clittle\u201d just to accomodate any possibility of such works. Since this can be misleading, we will correct it as \u201c... there is no work on ...\u201d instead. We will be happy to cite and discuss similar papers if reviewers can tell us any.\n5. **Other concerns,** we will reorganize our paper and correct the typos to make it more friendly to readers. We will also avoid highlighting \u201cco-generative\u201d which might be misleading to the readers.

Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of their approach.\n\nI was not completely convinced by the arguments made by the authors and their motivation. Overall the paper felt a little heuristic in nature and the presentation made it difficult to follow. Here are the major aspects which were unclear to me (refer below).\n\n1) What is the primary motivation for the authors ? Why do the authors think using a latent graph topology is in general better than using a fixed topology ? Is it always true that using a fixed topology is undesirable or only in some cases only ? Some arguments/examples from the authors which can validate this using real-world settings would have helped. Irrespective of Graph Matching problem, Social Networks can be a good application for verifying this. Fake (due to noise) and real edges in connections/friendship network would be a good indicator for the authors' intuition i.e. the latent topology should be able to filter out the fake edges.\n\n2) With regards to eqn. 1, is the condition Hz = 1 enough to ensure that each row and column sums to 1 ?\n\n3) Why did the authors only consider absolute/boolean assignments (0/1) in the paper rather than partial assignments which can be more flexible i.e. soft assignments (0 <= z_i <= 1) such that each row and column sums to 1 ? Is there some specific reason for this ?\n\n4) In section 2.4.1, the authors propose to use the straight-through operator for their rounding task. Did the authors try any other approaches ? How did the bias of the straight-through operator hamper their final optimization solution and by how much ?\n\n5) With regards to eqn. 15 wherein the authors use an independence assumption, how much did the accuracy of their estimation suffer as a result to this quantitatively ?\n\n6) The authors also mention that their deterministic learning approach is often more efficient while the generative learning method can be more accurate at the cost of additional overhead. Do the authors have results with regards to this overhead ? How significant is it and how does it compare to time complexity of the other state-of-the-art methods ? This is even more relevant given for many of the results, the improvement is only marginal compared to other competitors.\n\n7) Based of the results, can the authors claim that improvement in the results over other competitors is due to the efficacy of their approach and the factuality of their arguments ? Could it be due to richness/complexity of their model/learning strategy ? \n\n8) What do the authors mean by \"normalized connectivity\" in section 2.1 ? Does it mean the augmented Adjacency matrix which contains self loops i.e. A_tilde = A + I ? \n\n9) Given the authors in their approach model the adjacency matrix, thus how does the authors' approach compare against traditional graph based modeling techniques i.e. Stochastic Block Model and Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model for instance ? \n\nI would appreciate it if the authors made their code available for review/reproducing results. Additionally I felt the paper needed more analysis/discussion. Overall the presentation of the paper needs to improve significantly.

They mention algorithm names (Delaunay triangulation and k-nearest neighbors, section 1), and that the construction is heuristic (page 3), but do not provide any clue on the (formal) definition of the topology. (I recall that the paper deals with estimation of the graph topology.)\n\n\nIn section 2, it is proposed to estimate both the topologies of the two graphs and their matching. In my opinion, the problem is not defined in a sufficient formal way so that the reader can exactly understand the rationale behind the methods.\nI also think that, at this stage, the connection with how the topology is initially estimated in the literature would both help the reader to understand the optimization problem at stake, and highlight the originality of this piece of work.\n\nI have the following (naive) question: isn't the optimal topology the one that does not allow any edges in the graph, since it should allow the greatest flexibility in the matching of the nodes? Of course, this solution is not of interest for the applications, but I do not see why it is excluded from the investigated approach.\n\n\nThe authors claim that optimizing eq. (13) is intractable and thus choose to maximize a lower bound through an EM-like algorithm. However, they do not prove the relation with the initial optimization problem. As is usually the case, does it allow for local optimization of (13)?\n\n\nIn the real data analysis, the methods are compared through their accuracy scores and not on the estimation of the latent topology. Of course, it is irrelevant at this place since the other algorithms do not estimate it. Nevertheless, it should be interesting to have a quantitative analysis of this output of the algorithm.\n\n\nFor all of these reasons, I think that this paper deserves to be significantly improved before being published.\n\n\nMore comments and questions:\n\n+ The reader can not read and understand Figure 1 given on page 2 without reading the paper until page 7.\n\n+ What is the normalized connectivity (page 3)?\n\n+ The authors mention twice in the paper that there is only little work on \"exploring graph topology learning / generation for deep graph matching\" (introduction and conclusion) without any references explicitly related to this sentence. Are there papers that deal with the same strategy? I believe that the article should be clearer on that point. On this topic, I also think that the structure of the paper should be revised, with the section dedicated to related works (section 4) presented earlier.\n\n+ The qualitative analysis presented in Appendix A.5 is very interesting and should be presented in the main document.\n\n\nTypos:\nPage 5: which in intractable\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper172/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper172/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Latent Topology for Graph Matching", "authorids": ["~Tianshu_Yu2", "~Runzhong_Wang1", "~Junchi_Yan2", "~Baoxin_Li1"], "authors": ["Tianshu Yu", "Runzhong Wang", "Junchi Yan", "Baoxin Li"], "keywords": ["Graph matching", "generative graph model", "latent structure learning"], "abstract": "Graph matching (GM) has been traditionally modeled as a deterministic optimization problem characterized by an affinity matrix under pre-defined graph topology.

More specifically, the paper proposes methods to leverage the power of deep networks to come up with an end-to-end framework that jointly learns a latent graph topology and perform GM, which they term as deep latent graph matching (DLGM).\n\nStrengths: The proposed method seems justified. The authors both explore a novel direction for GM by actively learning latent topology.  They further propose both a deterministic optimization-based approach a generative way to learn effective graph topology for matching. Regarding the empirical results of the paper, the authors report that their methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, in comparison against a few peer methods (in measures of both accuracy and F1-score). \n Other than that, their claims appear to be correct, and so is the empirical methodology. Relation to prior work and differences are discussed.\n\nWeaknesses/Comments: The paper was very difficult to follow (maybe it is due to the fact that I am not highly familiar with part of the field.
