This was commented in the introduction: \"[in semantic segmentation benchmarks],  insideness  is  not  necessary  since a solution can rely only on object recognition.\" Also, we agree with R#5 that segmentation is not the same as insideness, eg. in the introduction we mention: \u201c[In this paper,] we take the reductionist approach by isolating insideness from other components in image segmentation.\u201d\n \nYet, note that the motivation of analysing insideness is to understand the generalization capabilities of existing segmentation architectures beyond current benchmarks in natural images. This motivation arises from the recent trend of tackling more sophisticated segmentation tasks, eg. segmentation in images that lack texture or color (as in cartoons and sketches) or with unfamiliar objects (such as objects with different textures from those seen during training), in new tasks that require more sophisticated visual spatial reasoning (such as containment or instance-aware segmentation), etc. Note that insideness is a key component for image segmentation in such general settings. Analysing insideness in isolation is a step towards solving these more challenging segmentation problems. Thus, the motivation of this work goes beyond improving DNNs in the current benchmarks (although improvements in these benchmarks with insideness can not be discarded, as pointed out in \u201cfuture work\u201d). We have reworded the Introduction in order to further clarify these points. \n\nWe think that R#5\u2019s concern can be also resolved with R#2's comments, who has \u201cread the paper thoroughly\u201d (quoting R#2): \"This work is not like other segmentation publications that just propose a network and start training, but perform some deep analysis about the generalization capability of the existing network architectures.\", \"It helps other researchers to rethink the boundary problem by using the insideness concept. I think this work will have an impact in semantic segmentation field.\" and \u201cThis paper is well written and well motivated.\u201d\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kimvc@mit.edu", "vilim@neuro.mpg.de", "amineh@mit.edu", "jamell@mit.edu", "francl@mit.edu", "fazevedo@mit.edu", "tomotake.sasaki@fujitsu.com", "xboix@mit.edu"], "title": "Do Deep Neural Networks for Segmentation Understand Insideness?", "authors": ["Kimberly M Villalobos", "Vilim Stih", "Amineh Ahmadinejad", "Jamell Dozier", "Andrew Francl", "Frederico Azevedo", "Tomotake Sasaki", "Xavier Boix"], "pdf": "/pdf/e8524b8387d9eb5bb53596dbc72a77b872b30814.pdf", "TL;DR": "DNNs for image segmentation can implement solutions for the insideness problem but only some recurrent nets could learn them with a specific type of supervision.", "abstract": "Image segmentation aims at grouping pixels that belong to the same object or region.

We show that the neurons of the feed-forward networks are tuned to the features of the curves in the dataset and there are no signs that they capture the long-range dependencies necessary for solving insideness in general. Also, we found that the recurrent networks expand the inside/outside regions starting from the curve, resulting in only local features being used to determine the direction of expansion. Thus, the DNNs that we evaluated do not generalize because they learned solutions that do not take into account the long-range dependencies in an effective way. These learned solutions are sufficient to achieve high accuracy in the family of curves seen during training, but they do not  generalize to other curves. Then, in section 4.3 we show that the learning strategy can be constrained with stepwise learning in order to encourage that the learned solution captures the long-range dependencies and can generalize. We have reworded these sections to make clear the insights we provide. \n\nRegarding that R#5 does not find surprising that the stepwise learning improves the generalization capabilities, we would like to emphasize the massive gains of accuracy yielded by this strategy. Observe that the stepwise training leads to a cross-dataset accuracy of almost 100% while with the standard learning the cross-dataset accuracy is only ~20% in the best case. In the revised version of the paper, we have emphasized this massive improvement by splitting Fig.5b into two: one for the cross-dataset evaluation and the other for the within dataset evaluation (moved to the appendix). It can now be seen after a quick assessment that the improvement of the generalization capabilities with the step-wise learning is very large. We believe this is a non trivial observation, given that stepwise learning has not been used in any of the state-of-the-art learning strategies.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kimvc@mit.edu", "vilim@neuro.mpg.de", "amineh@mit.edu", "jamell@mit.edu", "francl@mit.edu", "fazevedo@mit.edu", "tomotake.sasaki@fujitsu.com", "xboix@mit.edu"], "title": "Do Deep Neural Networks for Segmentation Understand Insideness?", "authors": ["Kimberly M Villalobos", "Vilim Stih", "Amineh Ahmadinejad", "Jamell Dozier", "Andrew Francl", "Frederico Azevedo", "Tomotake Sasaki", "Xavier Boix"], "pdf": "/pdf/e8524b8387d9eb5bb53596dbc72a77b872b30814.pdf", "TL;DR": "DNNs for image segmentation can implement solutions for the insideness problem but only some recurrent nets could learn them with a specific type of supervision.", "abstract": "Image segmentation aims at grouping pixels that belong to the same object or region.

Our definition of insideness does not take into account the Gestalt\u2019s law of closure because in our definition, if there is a discontinuity in the curve all the image would be considered as \u201coutside\u201d region, ie. the \u201cinside\u201d region requires a complete closure of the curve. This simplification is because of the reductionist approach we have used in the paper, which isolates insideness from other factors and facilitates its analysis. Now that we have gained some understanding of the generalization capabilities of existing DNNs for insideness, we are ready to explore a more sophisticated version of insideness in future works. The Gestalt\u2019s law of closure is a very interesting research direction. We have added this in the paper in section 2 and future work, jointly with the other factors we already commented (eg. the representation of the hierarchy of segments)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kimvc@mit.edu", "vilim@neuro.mpg.de", "amineh@mit.edu", "jamell@mit.edu", "francl@mit.edu", "fazevedo@mit.edu", "tomotake.sasaki@fujitsu.com", "xboix@mit.edu"], "title": "Do Deep Neural Networks for Segmentation Understand Insideness?", "authors": ["Kimberly M Villalobos", "Vilim Stih", "Amineh Ahmadinejad", "Jamell Dozier", "Andrew Francl", "Frederico Azevedo", "Tomotake Sasaki", "Xavier Boix"], "pdf": "/pdf/e8524b8387d9eb5bb53596dbc72a77b872b30814.pdf", "TL;DR": "DNNs for image segmentation can implement solutions for the insideness problem but only some recurrent nets could learn them with a specific type of supervision.", "abstract": "Image segmentation aims at grouping pixels that belong to the same object or region.

The authors raise many interesting questions, such as (1) Does deep neural networks (DNN) understand insideness? (2) What representations do DNNs use to address the long-range relationships of insideness? (3) How do architectural choices affect the learning of these representations? This work adopts two popular networks, dilated DNN and ConvLSTM, to implement solutions for insideness problem in isolation. The results can help future research in semantic segmentation for the models to generalize better. \n\nI give an initial rating of weak accept because I think (1) This paper is well written and well motivated. (2) The idea is novel, and the proposed \"insideness\" seems like a valid metric. This work is not like other segmentation publications that just propose a network and start training, but perform some deep analysis about the generalization capability of the existing network architectures. (3) The experiments are solid and thorough. Datasets are built appropriately for demonstration purposes. All the implementation details and results can be found in appendix. (4) The results are interesting and useful. It help other researchers to rethink the boundary problem by using the insideness concept. I think this work will have an impact in semantic segmentation field. \n\nI have one concern though. The authors mention that people will raise the question of whether these findings can be translated to improvements of segmentation methods for natural images. However, their experiments do not answer this question. Fine-tuning DEXTR and Deeplabv3+ on the synthetic datasets can only show the models' weakness, but can't show your findings will help generalize the model to natural images. Adding an experiment on widely adopted benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes, VOC or ADE20K, will make the submission much stronger. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kimvc@mit.edu", "vilim@neuro.mpg.de", "amineh@mit.edu", "jamell@mit.edu", "francl@mit.edu", "fazevedo@mit.edu", "tomotake.sasaki@fujitsu.com", "xboix@mit.edu"], "title": "Do Deep Neural Networks for Segmentation Understand Insideness?", "authors": ["Kimberly M Villalobos", "Vilim Stih", "Amineh Ahmadinejad", "Jamell Dozier", "Andrew Francl", "Frederico Azevedo", "Tomotake Sasaki", "Xavier Boix"], "pdf": "/pdf/e8524b8387d9eb5bb53596dbc72a77b872b30814.pdf", "TL;DR": "DNNs for image segmentation can implement solutions for the insideness problem but only some recurrent nets could learn them with a specific type of supervision.", "abstract": "Image segmentation aims at grouping pixels that belong to the same object or region.

To this end, the authors carefully designed both feedforward and recurrent neural networks, which are, in principle, able to learn the insideness in its global optima. For evaluation, these methods are trained to predict the insideness in synthetically generated Jordan curves and tested under various settings such as generalization to the different configuration of curves or even different types of curves. The experiment results showed that the tested models are able to learn insideness, but it is not generalizable due to the severe overfitting. Authors also demonstrated that injecting step-wise supervision in coloring routine in recurrent networks can help the model to learn generalizable insideness. \n\nThis paper presents an interesting problem of learning to predict insideness using neural networks, and experiments are well-executed. However, I believe that the paper requires more justifications and analyses to convince some claims and observations presented in the paper. More detailed comments are described below.\n\n1. Regarding the usefulness of learning insideness to improve segmentation\nThe authors motivated the importance of learning insideness in terms of improving segmentation (e.g., instance-wise segmentation). However, I believe that this claim is highly arguable and needs clear evidence to be convincing. Although I appreciate the experiments in the supplementary file showing that some off-the-shelf segmentation models fail to predict insideness, I believe that these two are very different tasks (one is filling the region inside the closed curve and the other is predicting the labels given the object texture and prior knowledge on shapes; please also note that segmentation masks also can be in very complex shapes, where the prior on insideness may not be helpful). It is still weak to support the claim that learning to predict insideness is useful to improve segmentation. \n\n2. More analyses for experiment results      \nIn the experiment, the authors concluded that both feedforward and recurrent neural networks are not generalized to predict insideness in fairly different types of curves. However, it is hard to find further insights in the experiments, such as what makes it hard to generalize this fairly simple task. Improving generalization using step-wise supervision in a recurrent neural network is interesting but not surprising since we simply force it to learn the procedure of predicting insideness using additional supervision. \n\nTo summarize, although the problem and some experiment results presented in the paper are interesting, I feel that the paper lacks justifications on the importance of the problem and insights/discussions of the results. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1845/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kimvc@mit.edu", "vilim@neuro.mpg.de", "amineh@mit.edu", "jamell@mit.edu", "francl@mit.edu", "fazevedo@mit.edu", "tomotake.sasaki@fujitsu.com", "xboix@mit.edu"], "title": "Do Deep Neural Networks for Segmentation Understand Insideness?", "authors": ["Kimberly M Villalobos", "Vilim Stih", "Amineh Ahmadinejad", "Jamell Dozier", "Andrew Francl", "Frederico Azevedo", "Tomotake Sasaki", "Xavier Boix"], "pdf": "/pdf/e8524b8387d9eb5bb53596dbc72a77b872b30814.pdf", "TL;DR": "DNNs for image segmentation can implement solutions for the insideness problem but only some recurrent nets could learn them with a specific type of supervision.", "abstract": "Image segmentation aims at grouping pixels that belong to the same object or region. At the heart of image segmentation lies the problem of determining whether a pixel is inside or outside a region, which we denote as the \"insideness\" problem. Many Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) variants excel in segmentation benchmarks, but regarding insideness, they have not been well visualized or understood: What representations do DNNs use to address the long-range relationships of insideness? How do architectural choices affect the learning of these representations? In this paper, we take the reductionist approach by analyzing DNNs solving the insideness problem in isolation, i.e. determining the inside of closed (Jordan) curves. We demonstrate analytically that state-of-the-art feed-forward and recurrent architectures can implement solutions of the insideness problem for any given curve. Yet, only recurrent networks could  learn these general solutions when the training enforced a specific \"routine\" capable of breaking down the long-range relationships. Our results highlights the need for new training strategies that decompose the learning into appropriate stages, and that lead to the general class of solutions necessary for DNNs to understand insideness.", "keywords": ["Image Segmentation", "Deep Networks for Spatial Relationships", "Visual Routines", "Recurrent Neural Networks"], "paperhash": "villalobos|do_deep_neural_networks_for_segmentation_understand_insideness", "original_pdf": "/attachment/5353f0c7fde13dae13b8075236bb6e77cc8b0424.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nvillalobos2020do,\ntitle={Do Deep Neural Networks for Segmentation Understand Insideness?},\nauthor={Kimberly M Villalobos and Vilim Stih and Amineh Ahmadinejad and Jamell Dozier and Andrew Francl and Frederico Azevedo and Tomotake Sasaki and Xavier Boix},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryevtyHtPr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
