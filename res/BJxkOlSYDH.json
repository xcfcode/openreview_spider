We would like to first clarify that the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis [1] does not claim that the predictive accuracy of the pruned network is necessarily better than the unpruned network (pg. 2, para. 2 of [1]). In fact, from the figures of [1] (e.g., Fig. 3), we can see that the performance of the pruned network may improve at moderate sparsities (i.e., pruning ratios). On the other hand, in the regime of extreme sparsities the significantly compactified network may not perform as well as the original network [1]. This makes intuitive sense, since if it were the case that the pruned network\u2019s performance simply improves as we prune-and-retrain iteratively, we would end up with pruned networks with only a handful of parameters that outperform the original network. \n\nThis phenomenon occurs for, e.g., ResNet56, ResNet110, VGG16, and DenseNet22 in Fig. 3 of our revision. The unifying trend in all of these plots is that the pruned model tends to outperform the original model in the regime of moderate sparsities, however, as we compress the model further down and consider higher sparsities, we see that the pruned model\u2019s performance can no longer match (or outperform) the original model\u2019s performance.\n\nThe reported test error of the pruned model in Tables 1 and 2 of our submission are slightly above that of the original model because these tables focused on reporting the sparsest model possible that was within 0.5% of the original model\u2019s accuracy (i.e., commensurate accuracy). To further contextualize the performance of our method, we have added an additional table (Table 8 in the appendix) that reports statistics pertaining to the pruned model that (i) is within 0.5% of the original model\u2019s accuracy (akin to Tables 1 and 2), (ii) matches the original accuracy, and (iii) achieves the highest accuracy possible -- which in some cases, is higher than that of the original model. As our results show, the trade-off between predictive accuracy of the model and its size is an application-dependent choice that is up to the practitioner to decide.\n\n[1] The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lucasl@mit.edu", "baykal@mit.edu", "hlang08@gmail.com", "dannyf.post@gmail.com", "rus@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Provable Filter Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks", "authors": ["Lucas Liebenwein", "Cenk Baykal", "Harry Lang", "Dan Feldman", "Daniela Rus"], "pdf": "/pdf/7ac4cb1b260593c92731885f950f67112b1f21b8.pdf", "TL;DR": "A sampling-based filter pruning approach for convolutional neural networks exhibiting provable guarantees on the size and performance of the pruned network.", "abstract": "We present a provable, sampling-based approach for generating compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by identifying and removing redundant filters from an over-parameterized network.

Please find our specific comments below.\n\n1) \nOur initial experimental results were computed on a desktop computer to highlight that the method we propose is practical and easy to use for a wide range of data sets and network models. Since the initial submission, we have conducted more extensive experiments on the Cloud with a refined iterative prune-retrain strategy including larger models for CIFAR10 (see Fig. 3 and Tables 2 and 8 of our revision). We are currently running experiments on the ImageNet data set evaluated on various ResNet architectures. \n\nOur preliminary results (single prune-retrain cycle) of the experiments conducted on ResNet101 show that we can prune 55.40% (PR) of the network and achieve a FLOP Reduction (FR) of 50.80% with only a 0.69% increase in the Top-5 classification error on ImageNet. We are currently running refined ImageNet experiments with iterative prune-retrain cycles (as outlined in Sec. 4.1) and we will update our submission within the next couple of days with our results. We would also like to note that VGG and ResNets are commonly used for baseline evaluations and comparisons in contemporary network pruning literature [1-3]. Please see our general response for a list of updates to the results section.\n\nThe network used for the real-time regression task (see Sec. 4.5) of [4] is a lightweight model for use in autonomous driving scenarios. Our paper contains evaluations of our compression algorithm on this lightweight network (see Fig. 4). We would be happy to include results for other (lightweight) models as time permits. Please let us know if you have any particular models in mind for evaluation.\n\n2)\nWe have clarified the exposition to highlight that our original (and revised) submission already contains comparisons for selecting the top-k filters with the highest norms. The Filter Thresholding (FT) and SoftNet algorithms that are plotted in the figures and reported in the tables in Sec. 4 correspond precisely to this approach (also see Sec. E.1 - Comparison Methods of the appendix). In particular, the FT algorithm picks the k filters with the largest \\ell_2-norm (i.e., top-k \\ell_2 norm), whereas SoftNet picks the k filters with the largest \\ell_1 norm.\n\n3)\nOur main compression theorem (Theorem 8 in the appendix of the original submission) establishes bounds on the overall accumulative error, not just layer-wise error. The proof of the error propagation through all of the layers follows from the application of our layer-wise error bound (Theorem 2 of Sec. 2) and the error-propagation analysis of [4] (see Lemmas 2,3 and Theorem 4 in [4]). We agree with the reviewer that the reconstruction error of the previous layer has an affect on the variance of our estimator in the subsequent layers, however, this is taken care of in the error propagation analysis by iteratively conditioning on the fact that the previous layer is well-approximated, implying that our bounds are not affected by more than a constant.\n\nNevertheless, we understand that the placement of Theorem 8 in the appendix may have caused some unintended confusion regarding the scope of our theoretical guarantees \u2014 which, to be clear, are not just layer-wise guarantees, and in fact do ensure that the output of the network is well-preserved. To minimize confusion, we have moved our main compression theorem (Theorem 8) to the main body of the paper (see Theorem 3 of our revision) and have made the application of the error propagation bounds explicit. Thank you again for pointing out this source of confusion.\n\n\n[1] The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf)\n[2] SNIP: Single-shot Network Pruning Based on Connection Sensitivity ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02340.pdf )\n[3] Importance Estimation for Neural Network Pruning (http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Molchanov_Importance_Estimation_for_Neural_Network_Pruning_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)\n[4] Data-Dependent Coresets for Compressing Neural Networks with Applications to Generalization Bounds (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05345)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lucasl@mit.edu", "baykal@mit.edu", "hlang08@gmail.com", "dannyf.post@gmail.com", "rus@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Provable Filter Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks", "authors": ["Lucas Liebenwein", "Cenk Baykal", "Harry Lang", "Dan Feldman", "Daniela Rus"], "pdf": "/pdf/7ac4cb1b260593c92731885f950f67112b1f21b8.pdf", "TL;DR": "A sampling-based filter pruning approach for convolutional neural networks exhibiting provable guarantees on the size and performance of the pruned network.", "abstract": "We present a provable, sampling-based approach for generating compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by identifying and removing redundant filters from an over-parameterized network.

We believe that the new results highlight the versatility of our approach in that it is readily applicable to large-scale problems out-of-the-box. In other words, our new results on ImageNet were obtained by running our algorithm without any tuning of the hyper-parameters; this stands in contrast to existing approaches that generally require tedious, task-specific intervention or manual parameter tuning [1-2].\n\nMore specifically, we evaluated and compared our algorithm in two scenarios on ResNet18/50/101 models trained on ImageNet: (i) prune-only experiments where the retraining step is omitted after pruning (see Fig. 6 in Sec. E.4) and (ii) iterative prune-retrain with a limited number (i.e., 2-3) of iterations (see Table 6 in Sec. E.4). For the former prune-only scenario, our algorithm significantly outperformed competing pruning approaches in all of the considered models. This suggests that our algorithm\u2019s baseline pruning effectiveness is better than that of the competing methods. \n\nFor the latter prune-retrain scenario (with limited iterations), we observe from Table 6 that our approach is competitive with the results obtained by the various state-of-the-art pruning algorithms. We would like to highlight that our algorithm\u2019s performance was competitive despite significant time (2-3 days) and resource constraints (8 NVIDIA Tesla V100). We conjecture that given more time and resources to conduct additional train-prune iterations for ImageNet, the relative performance of our algorithm would be even more favorable and would resemble the comparisons on CIFAR10 (see Table 8).\n\n\n[1] Pruning Filters for Efficient Convnets\n(https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08710)\n[2] Soft Filter Pruning for Accelerating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06866)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lucasl@mit.edu", "baykal@mit.edu", "hlang08@gmail.com", "dannyf.post@gmail.com", "rus@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Provable Filter Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks", "authors": ["Lucas Liebenwein", "Cenk Baykal", "Harry Lang", "Dan Feldman", "Daniela Rus"], "pdf": "/pdf/7ac4cb1b260593c92731885f950f67112b1f21b8.pdf", "TL;DR": "A sampling-based filter pruning approach for convolutional neural networks exhibiting provable guarantees on the size and performance of the pruned network.", "abstract": "We present a provable, sampling-based approach for generating compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by identifying and removing redundant filters from an over-parameterized network.

Among most heuristics prune method,  pruning with mathematics guarantee is indeed more convincing. We expect this work can help people devoting some effort into more solid theoretical study in understanding the over-parameterized training.\n\nIntuitively speaking, the sensitive neuron has greater contribution for the final output, reusing the corresponding filter and carefully rescale its value require many empirically attempts. To achieve a more reasonable algorithm, author prune the redundant channel by controlling the deviation of the summation statistically small,  and reusing the filter by important sampling the given channel. Experiment show that this method can reach a competitive prune radio against other pruning algorithm, and show robustly in retained parameters vs error experiment.\n\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. experiment is too weak\n\nImageNet model has great impact on most CV problem, and the current release models are flooding in the open source world. Author should at least provide a imagenet model and make this work more convincing. Besides, Author should also consider an experiment in modern lightweight network, vgg and resnet like model are out of fashion and so big that any one can make a sound result on it. \n\n2. lack of a comparing experiment for random select the top-k norm. \n\nImportant sampling require an input of probability [p1, p2, p3, ... pn],  if those probabilities are nearly uniform, important sampling will behave like a random sampling method. In most case, if we want to prune the large channel network,  picking the top-1 significant filter or random sampling top-k filter will almost do the same thing.  \n\n3. lack of further theory consideration\n\nauthor only consider the single layer reconstruction, without discussing the overall accumulative error. Unlike the other deterministic method, sampling skill suffer variance propagation problem, the pre-layer variance will affect the sampling probability of next layer, how this pruning work if we change status of the pre-layer,  I didn't find any theoretical guarantee and only find a proof of single layer reconstruction bound.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2382/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["lucasl@mit.edu", "baykal@mit.edu", "hlang08@gmail.com", "dannyf.post@gmail.com", "rus@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Provable Filter Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks", "authors": ["Lucas Liebenwein", "Cenk Baykal", "Harry Lang", "Dan Feldman", "Daniela Rus"], "pdf": "/pdf/7ac4cb1b260593c92731885f950f67112b1f21b8.pdf", "TL;DR": "A sampling-based filter pruning approach for convolutional neural networks exhibiting provable guarantees on the size and performance of the pruned network.", "abstract": "We present a provable, sampling-based approach for generating compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by identifying and removing redundant filters from an over-parameterized network.
