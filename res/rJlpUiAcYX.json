For a 2D point set, the idea is to define a complex polynomial with the points (interpreted as complex numbers) as roots. To compare two point sets, the loss eventually boils down to evaluating the complex polynomial at all target points. The loss can be extended to high-dimensional point sets without the same theoretical framework. It is a sum over each target point the product of the distance of between the target point and all points of the source set. The claimed advantage of the proposed distance is it is more efficient compare to other metric such as Hausdorff distance or the sum of squared distance between matched point pairs (SMD). Experiments show that the proposed loss can be used in training.\n\nThe idea is interesting and new. However, the paper has a lot of room to improve. Here are a few specific issues that can be addressed in future version:\n\n1) It is unclear what the advantage of the new idea is. I agree it leads to strong gradients compared to Hausdorff distance. However, this way of pulling all points to all points may also be very inefficient, as each point can get pulled toward all target points. These forces can easily cancel each other. \n\n2) As already hinted in the paper, the gradient can be extremely unstable numerically. There is not any solution to address this issue.\n\n3) Experimental results do not show the proposed method has any advantage over others. Also important loss such as the Wasserstein distance should be considered and compared with.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper214/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Holographic and other Point Set Distances for Machine Learning", "abstract": "We introduce an analytic distance function for moderately sized point sets of known cardinality that is shown to have very desirable properties, both as a loss function as well as a regularizer for machine learning applications.

These distance functions have time-complexity O(N^2) unlike the previously proposed \"Hungarian distance\" based on the Hungarian algorithm which is O(N^3) in general. Moreover, they authors show that in two dimensions all local minima of the holographic loss are global minima.\n\nPros: The paper is well written, the ideas are clearly and succinctly presented. Exploiting the connection between 2D point sets and zeros of polynomials is an interesting idea.\n\nCons: The experimental section could be better. For example, the authors could do simple experiments to show how an optimization algorithm would explore the holographic loss surface (in terms of hitting global/local minima) in dimensions greater than two. Also, in the object detection example, no comparison is given with the Hungarian loss based algorithm of Stewart et al.
