With respect to other formulations of this view (e.g. Levine, 2018; I am referring to the references of the paper here), the paper identifies a shortcoming in the disregard of the agent\u2019s epistemic uncertainty (which seems to refer to the uncertainty with respect to the underlying MDP). It is argued, that algorithms based on the prevailing probabilistic formulation (e.g. soft Q-learning) suffer from suboptimal exploration.\nThe paper thus compares maximum entropy RL to K-learning (O\u2019Donoghue, 2018), which is taken to address the issue of suboptimal exploration due to its temperature scheduling and its inclusion of state-action pair counts in the reward signal. \n\nAs its technical contribution, the paper re-interprets K-learning via the latent variable denoting optimality employed in Levine (2018) and introduces a theorem bounding the distance between the policies of Thompson sampling and K-learning. Empirical validation of the claims is provided via experiments on an engineered bandit problem and the tabular MDP (i.e. DeepSea from Osband et al., 2017), as well as via soft Q-learning results on the recently suggested bsuite (Osband et al., 2019).\n\nI consider this paper a weak reject. This is in light of me finding it very hard to follow the papers main claims and arguments, even though it positions itself as communicating connections (\u201cmaking sense\u201d) in prior work, rather than presenting a novel algorithm. While this is in part due to the complicated issue and math being discussed (and the paper probably catering to a very narrow audience), the paper in its current state does seem to hinder understanding as well.\n\nOn the positive side, I do appreciate the intention of the paper, namely to connect RL as probabilistic inference, Thompson sampling and K-learning. In my opinion, this can be taken as a valuable addition to the current understanding of these approaches. Also, I like the experiments as they are specifically constructed to support the claims of the paper.\nOn the negative side, vague language, missing assumptions and lax notation seem to hinder the understanding of the paper to a considerable extend: e.g. it is stated, that \u201cwe connect the resulting algorithm with [\u2026] K-learning\u201d. However, I do not recognize a new algorithm being provided. Instead the paper argues in favor of K-learning. The assumptions that come with K-learning are not mentioned. The restriction of K-learning to tabular RL is taken to be understood implicitly (whereas RL as probabilistic inference seems applicable with function approximation also, which is not mentioned in the comparison). The paper always talks of shortcomings (plural) of RL as probabilistic inference, but only provides one argument (suboptimal exploration) with respect to this. RL as probabilistic inference is introduced in a different form as in prior literature (i.e. Equation 6), while the derivation in the Appendix spanning the differences in notation being hard to follow due to (maybe minor?) notational issues (e.g. x and y seem to have replaced s\u2019 and a; further down there is a reference to Equation 7, however probably it is meant to be 8 and even that with some leap in notation).\nThe paper would benefit from better proof-reading, where mistakes in a very dense argumentation make it hard to follow (e.g. I do not understand the sentence \u201cThe K-learning expectation (7) is with respect to the posterior over Q[\u2026] to give a parametric approximation to the probability of optimality.\u201d)\n\nLiterature wise, the paper draws heavily from two unpublished papers (Levine, 2018; O\u2019Donoghue, 2018). While this makes it harder to arrive at a high confidence level with respect to the paper\u2019s claims, I would not argue this to be critical.\nI would consider raising my score, if the authors would improve the accessibility of the paper by polishing the argumentation and notation. \n\nConfidence: low. It is very likely, that I have misunderstood key arguments and derivations. Also, I did not attempt to follow all of the technical derivations.\n\n\n======\npost rebuttal comment:\n\n\nI changed the score of my review in light of the rebuttal.\nThe changes made to the paper overall address my concerns.\nI do consider the additional explanations and re-phrasings as well as the improved notation a nice improvement of the paper.\nWhile I did not read all of the appendix, Section 5.1 is much more readable and understandable in the new version.\n\nIn light of this paper probably being published, I share some typos/inconsistencies I still noticed:\n\np. 4: the solving for -> solving for the\np. 7: s_{h+1} -> s' (in Table 3) ?\np. 7: table -> Table; tables -> Tables\np. 7: (Fix position of K:) \\pi_h(s)^K -> \\pi_h^K(s) ((also in Appendix))\np. 9: (2x) soft-Q learning -> soft Q-learning; Q Networks -> Q-Networks; Soft Q -> soft Q-learning\n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2446/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2446/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bodonoghue85@gmail.com", "iosband@google.com", "cdi@google.com"], "title": "Making Sense of Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Inference", "authors": ["Brendan O'Donoghue", "Ian Osband", "Catalin Ionescu"], "pdf": "/pdf/2f653b1fba689d249ca2d622778d13d1840816eb.pdf", "TL;DR": "Popular algorithms that cast \"RL as Inference\" ignore the role of uncertainty and exploration.

We have tried to address your major concern, which was the lack of accessibility of the paper, by\n\nMaking the assumptions clearer\nFixing the notation\nImproving the clarity of the language overall.\n\nWe have also tried to make it clear that we are not proposing a new algorithm, merely highlighting a shortcoming about RL as inference, and contrasting with alternative approaches. Moreover, it is not our intention to claim that K-learning is by any means the solution to the exploration problem, just that it, along with Thompson sampling (and other algorithms that we don\u2019t focus on) do actually explore in a directed manner. We also make the connection of K-learning to the current \u2018RL as inference\u2019 framework as it is currently understood in the literature. The reason we do this is primarily because the RL as inference framework has inspired many new and interesting algorithms in many subfields of RL, including hierarchical RL, options / skills, multi-agent, empowerment etc. We hope that highlighting a major issue that the framework suffers from, and demonstrating that a fix is possible, that the performance of these algorithms can be improved further with (hopefully) relatively little change.\n\nAs for the tabular vs function approximation issue, we do have a section entitled \u2018Why is RL as inference so popular?\u2019, in which we say \u2018Further [the RL as inference derived algorithms] are often easy to implement and amenable to function approximation\u2019. We want to stress that we understand that the RL as inference framework actually has a lot of value, but that the issue of sub-optimal exploration needs to be addressed. It is an open question as to how best to implement Thompson sampling and K-learning with function approximation - we have made this point more clear, though in response to your concern we have added some experiments with function approximation for both K-learning and Thompson sampling. These experiments suggest that it is at least possible.\n\nYou are correct that we have slightly modified the presentation of RL as inference. This is to make it easier to compare with the other techniques we compare against. However, the formulation is not new. The paper by Deisenroth et al. 2013 \u201cA survey on policy search for robotics\u201d uses the same presentation. In section 2.4.2.2 the authors of that paper propose P(O = 1| tau) \\propto exp(R(tau)), where R(tau) is the reward along the entire trajectory tau (they use an overloaded R instead of O to denote \u2018optimality\u2019, but other than that it is identical). The point here is that although the presentations differ ultimately the framework is the same.

The paper first clarifies some points of confusion regarding RL as inference, namely the fact that RL was originally an inference problem all along. A simple example is used to demonstrate that the RL as inference framework (Levine, 2018) fails to choose the optimal actions that resolve epistemic uncertainty, whereas the K-learning algorithm does select the optimal action. Further, a connection is made which reveals that K-learning is an approximate version of Thompson sampling - the strategy of using as single posterior sample of parameters given data for greedy actions which originated in bandit settings. Some empirical results are provided highlighting the cases where Soft Q-learning (Levine, 2018) fails but Thompson sampling and K-learning do not.\n\nI vote for accepting this paper as it brings to light an important limitation of the popular RL as Inference framework with a didactic example which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been shown before.\n\nThe paper does a great job at succinctly introducing a simple bandit problem where the bayes-optimal policy is to take a first action that is supposed to immediately resolve all epistemic uncertainty and then exploit the optimal action repeatedly for future plays. However, this simple problem is designed in such a way that there are several other sub-optimal actions which make the RL as inference algorithm have an exponentially low probability of selecting the optimal action. This implies that RL as inference, unlike Thompson sampling, does not in fact take into account epistemic uncertainty.\n\nFeedback to authors:\n- The introduction of family of MDPs caused a lot of confusion about the problem setting. I was not sure if a new MDP is sampled from \\phi at every episode in L or a single MDP is sampled and kept the same throughout. This was clarified later on in the middle of section 2.1, but it could have been introduced more carefully earlier on,\n- The tables 1-3 summarizing algorithms are useful but it would be great if there could be a side by side comparison of all three in a single table.\n- The notation is very dense and I see that efforts were made to avoid this, but it still feels inaccessible.\n- I am not sure of the role of experiments in section 4.3, if there is no comparison to K-learning. I understand that the authors leave it to future work but then the experiments feel out of place.\n- \u201c... RL as inference has inspired many interesting and novel techniques, as well as delivered algorithms with good performance on problems where exploration is not the bottleneck (Gregor et al., 2016)\u201d. I think this sentence is false, Gregor et. al. do not employ RL as inference anywhere in their paper. Also, I don\u2019t think the point of their paper was to show good performance on any problem. Maybe this was mixed up with Eysenbach, 2018, a successor paper which uses RL as inference?\n\n \n\nReferences:\nO'Donoghue, Brendan. \"Variational Bayesian Reinforcement Learning with Regret Bounds.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.09647 (2018).\n\nLevine, Sergey. \"Reinforcement learning and control as probabilistic inference: Tutorial and review.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.00909 (2018).\n\nGregor, Karol, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, and Daan Wierstra. \"Variational intrinsic control.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.07507 (2016).\n\nEysenbach, Benjamin, et al. \"Diversity is all you need: Learning skills without a reward function.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.06070 (2018)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2446/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2446/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bodonoghue85@gmail.com", "iosband@google.com", "cdi@google.com"], "title": "Making Sense of Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Inference", "authors": ["Brendan O'Donoghue", "Ian Osband", "Catalin Ionescu"], "pdf": "/pdf/2f653b1fba689d249ca2d622778d13d1840816eb.pdf", "TL;DR": "Popular algorithms that cast \"RL as Inference\" ignore the role of uncertainty and exploration.
