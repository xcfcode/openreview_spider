In our paper, we have used the following baselines for directed graphs: HOPE [Ou et al. in ACM SIGKDD 2016], APP [ZHOU et al. in AAAI 2017] and Graph2Gauss [BOJCHEVSKI et al. in ICLR 2018]. All of them (HOPE, APP, Graph2Gauss) have explicitly written that they consider directions. We will make sure to stress this in our paper. However, DeppWalk model [Perozzi et. al. in ACM SIGKDD 2014] was only used as a representative baseline for the un-directed class of algorithms. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestions for the new baselines. However, Okada-Imaizumi model [Behaviormetrika 14.21 (1987)] was under a pay-wall that was not accessible with our institution's subscription. Without any success, we have tried our best to find any publicly available material on the manuscript or the code. \nFurthermore, as you have suggested, the work MUZELLEC et al. in NIPS 2018 [35] is available and we have included additional experiments with elliptical embedding. We observe that elliptical embedding is not outperforming our method on Political Blogs network:\nmethod      (Pearson, Spearman, avg. MI, std. MI) \nKL                      (0.88,  0.89, 0.85, 0.006)\nElliptical           (-0.17, -0.14, 0.036, 0.004)\nAPP                   (0.16,  0.29, 0.15, 0.006)\nHOPE                (0.45,  0.45, 0.65, 0.007)\nGraph2Gauss  (-0.17, -0.33, 0.09, 0.005)\nDeepWalk         (0.25,  0.24, 0.12, 0.005)\n\nThe work of Muzellec et al. studies the problem of embedding objects as elliptical probability distributions, which are the generalization of Gaussian multivariate densities. Their work is rooted in the optimal transport theory by using the Wasserstein distance. The physical interpretation of this distance in the case of optimal transport is given by the cost of moving mass from one distribution to another one. In particular, for univariate Gaussian distributions, the Wasserstein distance between embedded points becomes the two-dimensional Euclidean distance of ($\\mu_1,\\sigma_1$) and ($\\mu_2,\\sigma_2$), i.e. flat geometry.\nIn our case, the geometry of univariate Gaussians has constant negative curvature, and distance is measured with the Fisher distance. Our work is rooted in statistical manifold theory, where the Fisher distances arise from measuring the distinguishability between different distributions.\n\n2. Since the down-stream application was also raised by reviewer #2 point 2, we reply in a joint manner: \nWe agree that the majority of node embeddings are used for down-stream learning tasks. In this paper, we have focused on the unsupervised setting and finding representations that can preserve geodesic relationships between nodes in a directed graph first. We have focused on the graph representation itself, its geometrical properties, connections to existing mathematical frameworks and learning. We believe that for supervised tasks a modification to the loss function is needed. \nAt the same time, we agree with the reviewer and thus include a down-stream learning task that is suitable for the unsupervised scenarios. In particular, for every node u with outdegree k, we retrieve the k best candidate neighbors from each embedding and compare them to the direct successors of node u. To assess the performance, precision is computed, which tells us the ratio of actual neighboring links the embedding can extract. The same is done for incoming links, using the in-degree of each node. This kind of task was previously used in several papers that study graph embeddings e.g. [Tsitsulin et al., WWW 2018] and [Khosla et al., ECMLPKDD 2019]. \nHere, we report the precision for outdegree and indegree link reconstruction for Political Blogs network. \nMethod \t\t        (outdegree precision, indegree precision)\nAPP \t\t        (0.1077, 0.2624)\nHOPE \t\t        (0.1010, 0.1125)\nDeepWalk \t        (0.2620, 0.1669)\nGraph2Gauss \t(0.0258, 0.0003)\nElliptical \t\t(0.0383, 0.0250)\nKL \t\t                (0.2861, 0.2329)\n\n\nAlthough, on average, our method (KL) is performing well, it was not designed to encode only the local neighborhood but rather the whole spectrum of finite and infinite distances. In our paper, we claim that our representation is designed for preserving the global geodesic information of directed graphs in an unsupervised setting. To excel at other supervised tasks, one would have to modify the loss function to include additional terms more suitable for that down-streaming task, which is part of our future work. \n\n\nAn updated version of the paper is uploaded.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1982/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1982/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["fun@biba.uni-bremen.de", "tian.guo0980@gmail.com", "alen.lancic@math.hr", "nino.antulov@gess.ethz.ch"], "title": "Low-dimensional statistical manifold embedding of directed graphs", "authors": ["Thorben Funke", "Tian Guo", "Alen Lancic", "Nino Antulov-Fantulin"], "pdf": "/pdf/5505a3164f03ecb8799366aee7409994bdcf64b1.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds and analyze connections to divergence, geometry and efficient learning procedure.", "abstract": "We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds, which is based on a global minimization of pairwise relative entropy and graph geodesics in a non-linear way.

It focuses on directed graphs, and it embedded the graph nodes into exponential power distributions, which include the Gaussian distribution as a special case. The method is implemented by optimizing with respect to the free distributions on a statistical manifold so as to achieve the minimum distortion between the input/output distances.  The method is tested on several directed graph datasets and showed superior performance based on several metrics.\n\nOverall, the submission forms a complete and novel contribution in the area of graph embeddings. A key novelty is that the authors used the asymmetry of KL divergences to model the asymmetry of the distances in directed graphs, and they use the fact that KL is unbounded to model the infinite distances in undirected graphs. The proposed method has three main hyperparameters, \\lambda in eq.(1), \\beta in eq.(2), and the dimensionality of the target embedding. The author showed that \\lambda and \\beta are not sensitive and can be set to the default values, and 2-dimensional distributions already give much better results as compared to alternative embeddings. Moreover, the author proposed a scalable implementation based on sampling. Furthermore, the authored justified their choice of the target embedding space through some minor theoretical analysis given in section 3.\n\nThe writing quality and clarity are good (well above average).\n\nTo further improve this paper (e.g., in the final version), the authors are suggested to incorporate the following comments:\n\nIn the experimental evaluation, it should include some cases when the dimensionality of the target embedding has a large value (e.g., 50). This will make the evaluation more complete.\n\nThere are some typos and unusual expressions.  For example, page 3, what is \"a good proposal function\"?\n\nAfter eq.(1), mention \\lambda is a hyperparameter (that is not to be learned).\n\nTheorem 1 (2), mention the Fisher information matrix is wrt the coordinate system (\\sigma^1, \\cdots,\\sigma^k, \\mu^1, \\cdots, \\mu^k)\n\nIdeally, the experiments can include an undirected graph and show for example that the advantages of the proposed method become smaller in this case."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1982/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1982/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["fun@biba.uni-bremen.de", "tian.guo0980@gmail.com", "alen.lancic@math.hr", "nino.antulov@gess.ethz.ch"], "title": "Low-dimensional statistical manifold embedding of directed graphs", "authors": ["Thorben Funke", "Tian Guo", "Alen Lancic", "Nino Antulov-Fantulin"], "pdf": "/pdf/5505a3164f03ecb8799366aee7409994bdcf64b1.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds and analyze connections to divergence, geometry and efficient learning procedure.", "abstract": "We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds, which is based on a global minimization of pairwise relative entropy and graph geodesics in a non-linear way.

Each node in the graph is mapped to a distribution in the space of k-variate power distributions, endowed with the KL divergence as asymetric similarity. The authors propose an optimization method based on a regularized KL divergence objective. They also propose an approximation of this objective based on finite neighborhoods, with a separate treatment of infinite distances based on a topological sorting. They also introduce a natural gradient correction to the gradient descent algorithm in this setting. They validate the fitness of their approach by showing that asymmetric distances in the graph translate into correlated asymetric distances between the node embeddings for various datasets.\n\nThe paper appears to bring a valuable method for directed graph embedding. However, a more thorough experimental study would help validating the improvements and hyperparameter setting of the method.

While the focus on preserving asymetric similarities is understandable, it would be interesting to know how the method performs for conventional evaluation tasks of network embedding, and to show that the gain in correlation can translate into gains for the end task in practice.\n\n* Spelling / grammar / layout *\n- Title: \u201cOn the geometry and learning low-dimensional embeddings\u2026\u201d does not make sense.\n- abstract: \u201cis better preserving the global geodesic\u201d\n- Fig 1: The sigma ellipse*s*\n- 2.1 Intuition.: \u201ccolor codded\u201d\n- Figure 2: \u201cwhich was reflected the highest mutual information\u201d\n- Figure 2 should visually identify the rows and the columns, rather than relying on the caption.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1982/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1982/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["fun@biba.uni-bremen.de", "tian.guo0980@gmail.com", "alen.lancic@math.hr", "nino.antulov@gess.ethz.ch"], "title": "Low-dimensional statistical manifold embedding of directed graphs", "authors": ["Thorben Funke", "Tian Guo", "Alen Lancic", "Nino Antulov-Fantulin"], "pdf": "/pdf/5505a3164f03ecb8799366aee7409994bdcf64b1.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds and analyze connections to divergence, geometry and efficient learning procedure.", "abstract": "We propose a novel node embedding of directed graphs to statistical manifolds, which is based on a global minimization of pairwise relative entropy and graph geodesics in a non-linear way.
