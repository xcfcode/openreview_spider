However, I feel the experiments are not good enough.\n\nFirst of all, the authors should give more explanation about the models Concrete-s and Concrete-z.\nI'm a bit confused here. What is the difference between these two models? Is Concrete-s the model that has two layer of discrete latent variables?\nWhat is Concrete-z? And what could we learn from it by comparing the models with VCAE?\nI think these are all very important points to be explained in this paper.\n\nSecondly, in the comparison of VAE and VCAE, are the number of parameters the same in both models? For fairness, should we compare the VAE with hierarchies to the proposed VCAE?\nAlso, a deterministic counterpart (adding an extra deterministic layer to the VAE) seems to be necessary in this case for comparison as well.\n\nTo sum up, the numbers look very promising, but it is not quite clear where the benefits come from (the surrogate variable or the increase of parameters).\nIf the authors are able to improve the experiment section including model ablation, and the numbers are still positive, I believe it could be a good paper in the future.

The model consists of two encoders, onde from x to s and the other from x to z. The objective is the standard variational lower bound with two KL terms, one for each encoder.\n\nI do not think the results presented in Tables 1 and 2 are necessarily comparable because the authors are essentially comparing 1-layer encoders (VAE, Concrete-s, NVIL and REBAR) with a 2-layer model (VCAE). A more direct comparison will be to use 2 layers in all models. In the NVIL paper for instance, one can see that going from 1 to 2 layers all SBNs, results in a gain of about 10 nats, which will make the results of NVIL and VCAE about the same.\n\nThe paper can be organized a little bit later, for example in the evaluation section the authors first present the model used for the second experiment (Table 2 and Figure 3), but naturally proceed to present results for the first experiment.
