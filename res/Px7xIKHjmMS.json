Why cannot usual GNNs produce an O(log n) approximation (and specifically Bourgain's embedding)?\n\n-- \"While there do exist semidefinite programming based algorithms (Linial et al., 1995) for computing the embeddings required for Bourgain\u2019s theorem, they are not suitable for implementation via efficient neural architectures. Instead [...] we adapt the sketch based approximate shortest path algorithms of Das Sarma et al. (2010)\"\n\nIn fact, the algorithm you implement is the one from Bourgain and Linial et al., not Dar Sarma et al. All those works use roughly the same sketching algorithm, which measures the distance of each point to randomly chosen clusters. However, the distance estimation procedure you implement (specifically ~d_G(s,t) = max_i|v_s^(i) - v_t^(i)|) is Bourgain's (this is just an ell-infinity embedding). Dar Sarma et al.'s estimation procedure is different and (building on the well-known work of Thorup-Zwick) relies on computing the common nearest neighbors of the given pair s,t in the random clusters. Note that this bears on the correctness of the proof of Theorem 8 (I think the statement still holds due to Matousek's analysis of Bourgain's embedding, but not for the reason you cite). Also note that in Theorem 8 (as well as all aforementioned results) c needs to be an integer (in particular, it is known that any approximation less than 3 is impossible with less than ~Omega(n^2) parameters).\n\n-- For min-cut, you write that traditional GNNs require Omega(sqrt(n)) depth/rounds, citing Loukas (2020). But doesn't that lower bound entail both the depth and the width (d*sqrt(w) = ~Omega(sqrt(n)))?\n\n-- I am unable to follow the proof of Theorem 9. Could you please explain the correctness of your construction.\n\n(On this note, the sentence \"Karger & Stein (1996) implies that with probability at least 1/n^2 there exists a prefix L' of L such that...\" seems like an unfortunate inaccuracy; the \"prefix\" exists deterministically, and their guarantee is that the iterative random contraction algorithm finds it with probability at least ~1/n^2.)\n\nConclusion:\n=========\nI am currently unable to recommend accepting this paper, due to what seems like multiple inaccuracies, misinterpretations of prior work, unclear statements, and possibly technical correctness issues. I will await clarifications from the authors on the points detailed above.\n\nPost discussion update\n=========\nAfter discussion with the authors, I have calibrated my score upward to 4, since the authors seemed willing to engage in discussion and correct/improve the paper, which I appreciate, but I still recommend not accepting the paper.\n\nThe authors generally acknowledged (though have not yet fixed) the issue of wrong attribution of the APSP algorithm. This isn't just a matter of citing B instead of A; the paper (still) contains a lengthy discussion of why A is not suitable, so instead they must resort to B, even though in reality they just use A (and B remains unused). This is glaring since these papers are famous classics, widely taught in graduate courses, their content is well known, and it is puzzling how a diametrically incorrect representation of them made its way into the paper.\n\nThe reason I dwell on this is that it signifies a larger issue with the paper. The original version was peppered with formal statements which were at best inaccurate, and even though the authors fixed (or said they would fix) the ones I pointed out, I remain unable to trust the overall technical soundness of the paper. The review time frame doesn't allow a reviewer to carefully verify every statement (nor would I want to), there must be some commitment of due diligence on part of the authors, that up to a small inevitable fraction of inaccuracies, the formal content is rigorously correct. I'm afraid the current version of the paper is quite off this mark.\n\nPutting formal soundness aside, my present understanding of the idea of the paper is the following: The authors observe that many basic computations on graphs can be parallelized into a few computations of small width and depth. Usual GNNs can implicitly implement this if their width is large enough, but this poses a computational burden, and there are obvious advantages to explicitly building this parallelism into the architecture. This seems like a sensible and potentially empirically useful observation, but the experimental section still seems too thin to make the case properly. That said, perhaps I have not fully understood the paper, since its frequent inaccuracies and fuzzy statements made it a bit hard for me to follow. \n\nIn conclusion. I think the paper should undergo a substantial revision:\n1. Clean up the theory part and ensure its formal soundness,\n2. Crystalize the point of the paper (in particular, rather than just presenting GNN+, I hope a revised version would include a more thorough comparison with usual GNNs - not just dismiss them with some citations of prior works which allegedly prove limitations - this leaves doubts about the exact model and assumptions, particularly since as discussed above, the prior work is not always cited accurately),\n3. Possibly expand the experimental section.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2207/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2207/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond GNNs: A Sample Efficient Architecture for Graph Problems", "authorids": ["~Pranjal_Awasthi3", "abhidas@google.com", "~Sreenivas_Gollapudi2"], "authors": ["Pranjal Awasthi", "Abhimanyu Das", "Sreenivas Gollapudi"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "Deep Learning Theory", "Graph Connectivity", "Minimum Spanning Trees"], "abstract": "Despite their popularity in learning problems over graph structured data, existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have inherent limitations for fundamental graph problems such as shortest paths, $k$-connectivity, minimum spanning tree and minimum cuts.

This building block trades of depth for width and involves multiple parallel regular GNN processing units. Using the GNN$^+$ architecture, the authors establish bounds for the required network depth (and total parameters) for several combinatorial problems over graphs.\n\nPros:\n+ A parallel processing architecture, as opposed to sequential processing, is also likely to be computationally more efficient in large memory setups.\n\n+ I haven't carefully checked all the proofs, but the key theorems seem relevant and interesting.\n\n+ The paper is clearly written for most parts and the key intuitions behind the theoretical results are explained in sufficient depth.\n\n\nCons:\n- The parallel GNN$^{mp}$ and MLP modules within a GNN$^+$ block all share parameters and hence, the only source of difference in the computed function is due to differences in initialization of node features. How is that difference executed in practice, both in the problems considered in this work and more generally for any graph problem? From the description in the experiments section, it seems that the networks are implemented using same set of features for the nodes during initialization (eg, node degrees, booleans for source and/or destination nodes).\n\n- The paper lacks evidence if this model outperforms GNNs on real-world graph datasets. All the problems considered in this work are combinatorial optimization problems on Erdos-Renyi graphs, for which non-learning based solutions also exist. While many of the theoretical results are also custom to these problems, one would hope that the architecture is also evaluated on standard tasks (eg, classification) for real-world benchmark graph datasets.\n\n- The central premise of the paper seems to be that the GNN$^+$ models require less depth (and total parameters) compared to standard GNN architectures. This is not clear from the experiments. A more descriptive result would be to assess the performance of these models as a function of depth (and total parameters).\n\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2207/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2207/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Beyond GNNs: A Sample Efficient Architecture for Graph Problems", "authorids": ["~Pranjal_Awasthi3", "abhidas@google.com", "~Sreenivas_Gollapudi2"], "authors": ["Pranjal Awasthi", "Abhimanyu Das", "Sreenivas Gollapudi"], "keywords": ["Graph Neural Networks", "Deep Learning Theory", "Graph Connectivity", "Minimum Spanning Trees"], "abstract": "Despite their popularity in learning problems over graph structured data, existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have inherent limitations for fundamental graph problems such as shortest paths, $k$-connectivity, minimum spanning tree and minimum cuts.
