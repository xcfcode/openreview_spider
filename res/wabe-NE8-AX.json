The current paper describes a new library (NNGeometry) for working with these matrices in PyTorch, incorporating approximate representations from prior work that are appropriate to matrix-vector product computations and evaluation of quadratic forms.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is the software library; no new analysis or algorithms are presented.  However, this seems like a useful software artifact for the particular problem that it tackles.  I recommend accepting it if there is space.\n\n### Additional details\n\n- The cosine angle measure is a somewhat peculiar choice for comparing approximate matrix-vector products and solves with their reference versions.  It is not only the direction of these vectors that matters, but also their magnitude, and so a normwise relative error seems much more natural.  For the (regularized) linear system, the natural choice might be a normwise relative residual.\n- While I understand the space constraints, I would have liked to see more discussion of the concrete matrix representations (Section 2.2.2).  In particular, there is not even a one-sentence description of the KFAC or EKFAC representation; only the name and a reference are given.  Adding a sentence or two would probably not break the page limit, and would make the paper more accessible to readers unfamiliar with those prior papers.\n\n### Minor points\n\n- Throughout, the authors should carefully check choice of citation style and how the citation reads (e.g. \"efficient techniques such as Goodfellow (2015)\" seems to refer to the cited paper as a technique; I suggest rewording to \"... such as those in Goodfellow (2015)\" (or \"of Goodfellow (2015)\").\n- Typos: \"inn\" to \"in\" (top of page 5), \"with on a large network\" - \"with a large network\" (start of Section 3)\n\n### Update\n\nThanks to the authors for their responses, particularly to the other reviewers who were more critical.  I still believe this is worth publishing if there is room, with the caveat stated before: this is an implementation paper, and does not introduce new algorithms or analysis.

The authors begin by providing a background on Fisher matrices and NTK and then present the main components of their proposed NNGeometry library (consisting of Layer Collection, Generator, and  Concrete Representations modules). A brief experimental study is provided in the last part of the paper. \n\nAssessment: While I think that a clean and effective computational library for implementation of Fisher matrices would greatly benefit the DL/ML research community, the current work falls short of the standards of an ICLR publication in numerous ways. \n\nDetailed Comments:\n- Towards the end of the introduction, the authors claim \"NNGeometry aims at making use of these appoximations effortless...\". I really do not see how NNGeometry is capable of doing this. One of the reasons why natural gradient methods (and its approximations such as K-FAC) are rather difficult to implement is that they are \"white-box\" optimization methods and very much model-dependent, i.e., different model architectures means that the Fisher matrices (and their approximations) can look very different from each other. Please see [1], [2] for the K-FAC approximations needed for convolutional and recurrent networks respectively. As an aside, I do not believe there is even a good open-source code for K-FAC on RNNs especially given the complexity involved. I did not find anywhere in the paper how NNGeometry addresses approximations for different types of layers.\n\n- A lot of spelling mistakes and strange notations throughout the paper. Here are a few I found- \"jacobian\" is not capitalized throughout, the big \"O\" notation in Equations 3 and elsewhere in the paper are all small \"o\"'s\n\n- The discussion in Section 1.2 is a bit wordy and not precise mathematically at times. I would suggest cutting down and citing [3]. Also, somewhere in the introduction, I think the authors should make a note of the distinction between the empirical Fisher matrix and the true Fisher matrix (and perhaps cite [4]); and be clear about which one they are working with. \n\n- Given that this is a library concerned with computing FIM/NTK; there should be some comparisons with existing open-source libraries such as JAX and Neural Tangents? \n\n- Lots of issues in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. It is not exactly clear where the authors are trying to do here; and there are many imprecise/incorrect mathematical statements throughout. I believe that the purpose of Section 2.2.1 was to describe that the FIM defines a Riemannian metric on the parameter space; and that the FIM is a representation of this metric in coordinate form. This is certainly true- but I cannot see the connection of this to the NNGeometry framework. Another purpose of this subsection was the notion of duality; for example, which objects may be pushed forward/pulled back (to be more precise, which ones live on the tangent and cotangent spaces). I would encourage the authors to look at the publicly-available JAX documentation/tutorial; where it is explained nicely how all of the theory + code fits together; JVP (Jacobian-vector products) / forward-mode autodiff <--> pushforward map of tangent spaces, VJP (vector-Jacobian products) / reverse-mode autodiff <--> pullback of cotangent spaces.\n\n- It would be great if the authors were more clear and explained explicitly the tricks in the sentence \"NNGeometry's generator incorporate similar tricks in several other places, including in implicit operations\". Many of these types of tricks are known to practitioners who have had to implement FIM (and its approximations); so I am curious what is the novelty provided by NNGeometry's generator here.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Grosse, Roger, and James Martens. \"A kronecker-factored approximate fisher matrix for convolution layers.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2016.\n\n[2] Martens, James, Jimmy Ba, and Matt Johnson. \"Kronecker-factored curvature approximations for recurrent neural networks.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2018.\n\n[3] Martens, James. \"New insights and perspectives on the natural gradient method.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.1193 (2014).\n\n[4] Kunstner, Frederik, Philipp Hennig, and Lukas Balles. \"Limitations of the empirical Fisher approximation for natural gradient descent.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2019.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "NNGeometry: Easy and Fast Fisher Information Matrices and Neural Tangent Kernels in PyTorch", "authorids": ["~Thomas_George2"], "authors": ["Thomas George"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Fisher Information Matrices (FIM) and Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK) are useful tools in a number of diverse applications related to neural networks.

We would like to first restate clearly (sorry if it was not made explicit enough in the paper) that the main contribution of NNGeometry is to offer a high level API for manipulating FIMs and NTKs, we do not claim novelty in how things are implemented at lower level.\n\nIn this new revision, we modified section 1.2 and 2.2.1 to address your comments, and we hope the following will clarify some other points:\n\n - \"Towards the end of the introduction, the authors claim \"NNGeometry aims at making use of these appoximations effortless...\". I really do not see how NNGeometry is capable of doing this. [...]\"\n\n=> This is precisely the \u201cwhite-box\u201d problem that is addressed by NNGeometry: With K-FAC for instance, it means that you can implement a natural gradient optimizer by writing natgrad = F_kfac.solve(grad,epsilon) regardless of the layer types, where grad and natgrad are PVectors, i.e. they contain all parameters of a network. Internally, NNGeometry will automatically choose between K-FAC for fully connected layers, and KFC for convolutional layers. While we do not currently support RNNs, here is a list of nn.Module layers in PyTorch that are already implemented: nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d, nn.GroupNorm, nn.BatchNorm2d (eval mode only). This already covers a range of modern deep architectures, and other layers will be implemented in the near future.\n\n - \"[...] \"jacobian\" is not capitalized throughout, the big \"O\" notation in Equations 3 and elsewhere in the paper are all small \"o\"'s\"\n\n=> Thanks for the typo with \u201cJacobian\u201d! However, little-o is a different symbol from big-O, so it is on purpose that it is denoted with a small \u201co\u201d. Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Little-o_notation for differences, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor's_theorem#Statement_of_the_theorem for Taylor expansion using little-o.\n\n - \"The discussion in Section 1.2 is a bit wordy and not precise mathematically at times. I would suggest cutting down and citing [3]. Also, somewhere in the introduction, I think the authors should make a note of the distinction between the empirical Fisher matrix and the true Fisher matrix (and perhaps cite [4]); and be clear about which one they are working with.\"\n\n=> Thanks for suggesting reference [3], we added it to section 1.2. In the paper we try to stay as general and concise as possible, this is why there is no mention of the discussion about empirical vs true Fisher. In section 2.1 we describe the true Fisher, and in the experiments section we use a Monte-Carlo estimate of the true Fisher as stated in section 3.1 . Using NNGeometry, you can also work with the 2nd moment of the gradients (a.k.a. the empirical Fisher), and we added a comment about it at the end of section 2.1. But as suggested by your reference [4] and other authors (e.g. Thomas et al. AISTATS 2020), there is some confusion about it, so we preferred to refrain from putting too much emphasis on this ongoing debate.\n\n - \"Given that this is a library concerned with computing FIM/NTK; there should be some comparisons with existing open-source libraries such as JAX and Neural Tangents?\"\n\n=> JAX and Neural Tangents are designed for different purposes than NNGeometry, even if some features overlap. For instance the experiments of section 3.1 \u201cQuality of FIM approximations\u201d cannot be implemented with JAX without having to implement each operation for each approximation method (e.g. what NNGeometry does for PyTorch). In that regard, there is no direct competitor to NNGeometry.\n\n - \"Lots of issues in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. [...]\"\n\n=> The purpose of section 2.2.1 is only to relate mathematical objects defined in previous sections, to Python objects defined by NNGeometry. In the revision, we modified this section to make it more clear. However,  we think that a discussion about the precise nature of parameter, function space, and linear maps between the tangent space and the cotangent space is out of the scope of the library for most users, e.g. for a continual learning practitioner there is no notion of Riemannian geometry involved in EWC.\n\n- \"It would be great if the authors were more clear and explained explicitly the tricks [...]\"\n\n=> The novelty of NNGeometry does not reside in its generator, but rather in the high level API to manipulate FIMs and NTKs. The purpose of this section was to make clear that NNGeometry\u2019s generator does not naively loop through examples in order to compute per-example gradients, but we instead have an implementation that is efficient enough to perform experiments on modern networks such as demonstrated in the experiments section. We however do not claim novelty for low-level implementations.\n\nOnce again, thanks for very valuable feedback. We hope to have answered your concerns.\n\nreference:\nThomas, Valentin, et al. \"On the interplay between noise and curvature and its effect on optimization and generalization.\" AISTATS, 2020."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "NNGeometry: Easy and Fast Fisher Information Matrices and Neural Tangent Kernels in PyTorch", "authorids": ["~Thomas_George2"], "authors": ["Thomas George"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Fisher Information Matrices (FIM) and Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK) are useful tools in a number of diverse applications related to neural networks.

I'm mostly concerned with the novelty and and significance of this work, although I need to admit I'm unfamiliar with the acceptance criteria for papers on software implementation.\n\n1. I think most of the techniques in the paper are from previous work. Thus I'm not sure there's enough novelty for an acceptance. The paper did not highlight any improvement in scaling. I believe all the speedup comes from taking advantage of GPU operation using the trick from Goodfellow, and the collection of matrix approximation methods that the paper cited.\n\n2. The paper focused on implementation, but surprisingly the experiments did not include any scaling/runtime results. I think the authors should show the efficiency gain, and demonstrate the type the applications that are enabled by it.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "NNGeometry: Easy and Fast Fisher Information Matrices and Neural Tangent Kernels in PyTorch", "authorids": ["~Thomas_George2"], "authors": ["Thomas George"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Fisher Information Matrices (FIM) and Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK) are useful tools in a number of diverse applications related to neural networks.

The package uses an abstract representation to allow the user to implicitly choose between different approximations to these objects and automatically makes a bunch of efficient choices \"under the hood\" for the user. The paper concludes with a selection of experiments that compare these approximations as well as verify their validity against Monte-Carlo estimates of these matrices.\n\nThe package seems like a really fantastic contribution to PyTorch. I will definitely try it out and most likely use it for my research.\n\nOn the other hand, I am worried that this is more of an engineering contribution than a research paper. To the point, all of the methods described in this paper and implemented in the package are based on methods present in other papers. Furthermore, the authors do not use the package to make any novel research contributions. Instead, they first show how their FIM approximations compare to Monte-Carlo estimates, and then they use their NTK approximations to reproduce some NTK results after training.\n\nI feel pretty undecided about whether ICLR should publish this paper. On the one hand, I think the package is very nice; it accumulates a bunch of useful approximations and allows for an efficient interface for switching between them. However, I don't know how significant this is as a research contribution; the authors propose no new methods nor do they achieve any novel results with their package. For now I think that the paper is not quite able to be published at ICLR, but I'm interested to hear what the authors and other reviewers have to say.\n\nTo that point, I wonder if the authors might use their package to show how it allows researchers to perform certain types of experiments that couldn't have previously been performed.\n\nSome minor comments and a question:\n- I think on Figure 3, the x-axis is lambda? It would be great if a label was included.\n- In the References section, Paccolat et al. (2020) is missing its arxiv number.\n- Could the authors include some detail about the type of Monte-Carlo experiments they did to compare for Figures 3-8? \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2268/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "NNGeometry: Easy and Fast Fisher Information Matrices and Neural Tangent Kernels in PyTorch", "authorids": ["~Thomas_George2"], "authors": ["Thomas George"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Fisher Information Matrices (FIM) and Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK) are useful tools in a number of diverse applications related to neural networks.
