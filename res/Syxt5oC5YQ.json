This work studies the networked optimization problem where there are several convex optimization objectives which must be solved subject to some (linear) constraints. The authors adapt classical momentum to this setting and prove convergence properties. The primary contribution seems to be handling this constrained setting. To quote the authors: \u201cIn the absence of constraints, (1) is trivial to solve [...]\u201d.\n\nWe believe that the second paper is more closely related (\u201cA Multi-step Inertial Forward\u2013Backward Splitting Method for Non-convex Optimization\u201d) but we still identify some critical differences. Algorithm 1 (MiFB) from this work introduces longer time dependence of the acceleration terms which we show AggMo also achieves in Appendix C.2. However, MiFB is parameterized by many more hyperparameters than AggMo (more than twice as many). The form of the loss is also decomposed into two terms, R and F, and MiFB uses two sequences (y_a and y_b), the second of which is used only for the gradient evaluation of F. Importantly, MiFB uses a proximity operator to push the iterates into a feasible set based on R --- something which we do not consider in AggMo. Finally, each iterate update uses only the current gradient update explicitly, while AggMo also uses a history of the gradients for each update (see Appendix C.2). To summarize, MiFB is stated very generally and due to the large number of parameters we believe that with some modifications it can probably recover AggMo-esque updates. However, if true, we expect this would hold for the vast majority of first order optimization algorithms and therefore do not consider this comparison to be especially informative.\n\nWe suspect that you are much more an expert on this setting than us and would be happy to receive any corrections on our interpretation of these papers.\n\nThank you for acknowledging the corrected numerical results. If you have no other concerns, we kindly ask that you consider raising your review score. Otherwise, we would be happy to answer any other questions you may have."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper553/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper553/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper553/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Aggregated Momentum: Stability Through Passive Damping", "abstract": "Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions.

We have intentionally presented AggMo in a simple form which makes it easily relatable to existing algorithms. However, AggMo realizes complex dynamics which in general escape many theoretical frameworks. In Appendix C.2 we show that AggMo can be written as a (K+1)-th order finite difference equation. We agree that AggMo is a simple extension of classical momentum but emphasize that most successful optimization algorithms are --- the challenge is in finding simple variants which perform well.\n\nWhile we do not present theoretical guidelines for choosing damping factors, we conduct an extensive empirical study and suggest a range of choices which we found worked well consistently. Choosing optimization hyperparameters is a huge challenge in deep learning, even with well known, extensively explored optimizers. For example, while practitioners typically use a damping coefficient of 0.9 with CM we found that we could achieve better performance with larger coefficients (and carefully tuned learning rates). AggMo is able to use larger damping coefficients without such extensive tuning. Furthermore, AggMo is able to recover CM, NAG, and other algorithms and can make direct use of theoretical convergence results for these.\n\nPer your suggestion, we have moved the online convex programming theoretical results into the main text.\n\n\n\n> What is \\lambda in Fig. 1?\n\nThis indicates the eigenvalue associated with the plotted eigendirection trajectory.

Revised paper has been corrected.", "comment": "Thank you for your feedback!\n\n#1 Empirical Results\n\nWe thank you in particular for pointing out the issues with the ResNet-34 results. After investigating these further we were able to confirm a bug in our implementation, causing batch norm statistics to become fixed after a single epoch of training. We reran the experiments with this bug fixed and have updated the paper to reflect this. Due to computational limitations, we replaced the ResNet-34 architecture with ResNet-32.\n\nTo summarize, CM is now able to achieve similar final accuracy to AggMo but AggMo retains faster convergence throughout training. We are confident that the numbers reported are correct and in fact we report almost a full percentage higher accuracy than the original ResNet paper on CIFAR-10 with CM (they reported 92.49%).\n\nThe bug also prompted us to rerun these experiments with batch norm completely disabled. We found that AggMo is able to remain stable over a large range of learning rates even without batch normalization. Without batch normalization, AggMo achieves a final test accuracy on CIFAR-100 of 69.32%, more than 2% higher than the best value achieved by CM.\n\nWe apologize for the issue with the original results but want to emphasize that this did not affect any other empirical results. We would also like to point out that AggMo performed consistently well across all tasks and is able to do so over a wide range of hyperparameters settings. We believe that the results as a whole clearly show that AggMo is a powerful optimizer that often outperforms well established methods, even on tasks that have been developed with the original methods in mind (e.g. the model hyperparameters we used are chosen to work well with CM). Less formally, in other settings we have applied AggMo to a huge variety of problems and have yet to find a failure case. We would be happy to address any other specific concerns you have about the empirical results.\n\n#2 Similarity to multi-step gradient methods\n\nCould you please clarify what you mean by \u201cmulti-step gradient methods\u201d? After looking ourselves, this seemed to be a less common term for multi-state algorithms such as CM or Nesterov. We see this as a pro and not a con of our algorithm. For example, much of the intuition for tuning hyperparameters for Nesterov/CM carries over to AggMo. Reviewer 3 raised a similar concern on the incremental nature of AggMo. We have responded to them but repeat that argument here. We have intentionally presented AggMo in a simple form which makes it easily relatable to existing algorithms. However, AggMo realizes complex dynamics which in general escape many theoretical frameworks. In Appendix C.2 we show that AggMo can be written as a (K+1)th order finite difference equation. We agree that AggMo is a simple extension of classical momentum but emphasize that most successful optimization algorithms are --- the challenge is in finding simple variants which perform well.\n\n#3 Minor comments\n\nWe have punctuated the equations and added in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d section heading as requested.\n\nThank you again for your review. We hope that our above comments and new empirical results address your concerns. We are happy to discuss any other concerns raised in your response."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper553/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper553/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper553/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Aggregated Momentum: Stability Through Passive Damping", "abstract": "Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions.
