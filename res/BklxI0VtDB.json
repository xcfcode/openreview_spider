Nevertheless, the rebuttal and the comments of the other reviewers did not convince me that this paper is ready for publication at ICLR and I keep my vote with weak reject. IMO this paper can be improved by either focussing more on the HRL part and performing simpler qualitative evaluations to highlight the HRL contribution OR by focussing completly on the robotics part by incorporating more classical robotics approaches and demonstrating their shortcommings within the experiments. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary:\nThe paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning scheme to search for objects specified by an image. The proposed learning approach is applied to a virtual house setting and compared against multiple baselines. \n\nI like that the authors do an extensive comparison of different baselines and compare their results. My main concern is the setup with the task, which seems quite artificial. Learning to search for objects using pure RL seems like neglecting all robotics research from the past 50 years. By now we can generate maps, planners and low-level control policies to navigate within these maps. Such approaches would be able to remember the objects location and just return to them and do not need to discover them 1000x times to remember them. Therefore, one would only need to learn an optimal search pattern. Therefore, I would like to see the proposed HRL approach in a more appropriate experiment or even more excitingly be combined with classical robotics. I think that this combination should be quite exciting. \n\nRegarding the HRL, could the authors please state their contributions in more detail? There is quite some work on subgoal generation within HRL. How does your work differ from these? \n\nCurrently, I am for borderline reject but I am happy to increase my rating during the rebuttal, when the authors clarify the motivation for the experiment and their contribution to HRL. \n\nMinor Comments: \nI think that the acronym is badly chosen. The term ROS is already famously coined within the robotics community for the Robot Operating System. Therefore, using this acronym for a robotics tasks is really confusing. \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1126/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1126/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ROS-HPL: Robotic Object Search with Hierarchical Policy Learning and Intrinsic-Extrinsic Modeling", "authors": ["Xin Ye", "Shibin Zheng", "Yezhou Yang"], "authorids": ["xinye1@asu.edu", "szheng31@asu.edu", "yz.yang@asu.edu"], "keywords": ["Robotic Object Search", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "In this paper, we present a novel two-layer hierarchical policy learning framework that builds on intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for the task of robotic object search.", "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Robotic Object Search (ROS) over the recent years with deep reinforcement learning based approaches, the sparsity issue in reward setting as well as the lack of interpretability of the previous ROS approaches leave much to be desired.

We address the concerns as below,\n1. We would like to reiterate the contribution of our work is the general hierarchical RL framework we proposed that 1) builds upon the human specified sub-goal space to incorporate human prior knowledge, that makes such a challenge task easier to learn and the solution interpretable; 2) optimizes with the intrinsic and the extrinsic rewards jointly to overcome the lingering inconsistency coming from the unsatisfied prior knowledge. \n    The motivation is that we observed for challenge tasks, previous work that learn to build the hierarchy and the sub-goal space themselves without prior knowledge achieve poor performance, while other work that fully adopt the human-specified sub-goal space ignore the possibility that the prior knowledge may not be accurate enough for learning the hierarchical policy.\n    Robotic object search is such a task where humans can specify the sub-goal space as approaching a currently visible object based on the prior knowledge that approaching a related object may increase the probability of seeing the target object. However, such prior knowledge and sub-goal space is not satisfied for learning an optimal hierarchical policy, i.e. to approach the target object, the robot does not necessarily to be close enough to a sub-goal specified object. We therefore demonstrate our proposed hierarchical RL framework on this task, and we believe  the more challenging the task is, the more difficult it is for humans to provide satisfied prior knowledge and designate sub-goal space.\n    Overall, we believe our proposed hierarchical RL framework shed light on learning challenge tasks by utilizing human prior knowledge in a proper way. The definitions of  the sub-goals or reward functions can be modified willingly in accordance with the different tasks.\n\n2. The focus of this paper is to learn a hierarchical policy for robotic object search task that is able to address the sparse reward issue, so we compared our method with other hierarchical RL methods rather than all methods addressing the sparse reward issue. \n\n3.

We address the concerns as below.\n1. We definitely agree with the reviewer that the classic robotic research, such as map-based navigation, has achieved great success, while we also believe they still have limits in the robotic object search task and we are trying to explore a new way to overcome these limits. To be specific ,\n    1) Map is not always necessary for target-driven navigation. Building a map is non-trivial and consequently navigating with the map may be inefficient especially when the indoor environment is typically dynamic.\n    2) Separating the mapping and planning is again not necessary and may compromise the robustness of the whole system.\n    3) To search the target object specified by an image, the robot needs an object recognition model. Combining the object recognition model with the classic navigation algorithm may require additional efforts since they are not designed to work together.\n\n2.

We address the concerns as below,\n1. We would like to reiterate the contribution of our work:  we propose a general hierarchical RL framework that 1) builds upon the human specified sub-goal space to incorporate human prior knowledge, that makes such a challenge task easier to learn and the solution interpretable; 2) optimizes with the intrinsic and the extrinsic rewards jointly to overcome the lingering inconsistency coming from the unsatisfied prior knowledge. \n    Existing work either learn to build the hierarchy and the sub-goal space themselves (such as Option-Critic method), or fully adopt the human-specified sub-goal space without considering the possibility that the prior knowledge may not be accurate enough for learning the hierarchical policy (such as HRL method). Both of them can be seen as specific cases of our framework (setting alpha as 0 or 1). However, our empirical experiments show neither one performs as well as our method, demonstrating that not only the value of the alpha matters, but also the way to properly integrate the advantages of both methods is of high significance.\n    Compared to HRL with stop method, though we both have a termination signal, HRL with stop method simply extends the HRL method by adding an additional \u201cstop\u201d action into the low-level atomic action space. Therefore, training the \u201cstop\u201d action remains the same as other low-level actions, i.e. $\\theta_{\\pi_l} \\gets \\theta_{\\pi_l} + \\nabla_{\\theta_{\\pi_l}} \\log\\pi_{\\theta_{\\pi_l}}(a|s, g, sg)(Q^i_l(s, g, sg, a)-V^i_l(s, g, sg))$, which depends on the intrinsic advantage the \u201cstop\u201d action brings compared to other low-level actions. While our method trains the termination signal by $ \\theta_t \\gets \\theta_t - \\nabla_{\\theta_t}term_{\\theta_t}(s, g, sg)(Q^e_h(s, g, sg)-V^e_h(s, g))$, that depends on the extrinsic advantage the current sub-goal brings compared to other sub-goals. The experimental results also demonstrate our training strategy is more efficient.\n\n2. For the experimental results, we define AS metric as the average steps over all successful cases. As we can see from Table 1, High-level only achieves very low success rate (SR), so the small AS actually indicates the method can successfully reach the goal states only when the starting positions are close to the goal states. Since SPL and AR take both SR and AS into consideration, they are reasonably low for the High-level only method.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1126/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1126/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ROS-HPL: Robotic Object Search with Hierarchical Policy Learning and Intrinsic-Extrinsic Modeling", "authors": ["Xin Ye", "Shibin Zheng", "Yezhou Yang"], "authorids": ["xinye1@asu.edu", "szheng31@asu.edu", "yz.yang@asu.edu"], "keywords": ["Robotic Object Search", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "In this paper, we present a novel two-layer hierarchical policy learning framework that builds on intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for the task of robotic object search.", "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Robotic Object Search (ROS) over the recent years with deep reinforcement learning based approaches, the sparsity issue in reward setting as well as the lack of interpretability of the previous ROS approaches leave much to be desired.

Subgoals are consist of different objects in the field of view which the robot can choose to approach. \nThe approach is evaluated on the House3D dataset, where it is shown to perform well. \n\nRecommendation: weak reject. \n\nThis isn't a bad paper, but I'm not sure it will be of broad interest at ICLR.\nIt is very specific to ROS problem and House3D dataset and doesn't seem to propose a general algorithm which can be broadly applicable elsewhere. The mechanism for generating subgoals and training the low-level policy is very task dependent (subgoals are constrained to be objects in the field of view, the intrinsic reward for training the low level policy is dependent on the size of the bounding box of the object defining the subgoal). While this probably accounts for improved performance on the House3D dataset, I think the audience of ICLR would be more interested in a general approach which can be used in many different domains (even at the cost of performing less well on a specific domain than something more tailored). This paper may be a better fit for a robotics conference. \n\nAnother point concerning the experimental evaluation. Sparsity of the rewards is mentioned as a main motivation for the hierarchical approach. However, there are a number of methods which use exploration bonuses to address this issue (pseudocounts, random network distillation, ICM etc. [1, 2, 3]). At least one of these should be included as a baseline.\n\nSpecific comments:\n- using two letters for denote a single variable is confusing, since it seems like a product. I.e. using \"sg\" to denote a subgoal, \"at_t\" to denote area. Please use a single letter and add subscripts if necessary to disambiguate.\n- in the various equations, please use \"\\log\" instead of \"log\" so that it is not italicized.\n- bottom of page 4: \"Q-leaning\" -> \"Q-learning\"\n- page 2: \"way pf\" -> \"way of\"\n- please use more informative names for Settings A/B\n- First paragraph in Section 2: \"hierarchical policy for the robot to perform the object search, motivated by how human beings conduct object search\". Saying the method is similar to how humans behave is a fairly big claim that should be substantiated by appropriate references, or not made at all.  \n\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01310\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1126/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1126/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ROS-HPL: Robotic Object Search with Hierarchical Policy Learning and Intrinsic-Extrinsic Modeling", "authors": ["Xin Ye", "Shibin Zheng", "Yezhou Yang"], "authorids": ["xinye1@asu.edu", "szheng31@asu.edu", "yz.yang@asu.edu"], "keywords": ["Robotic Object Search", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "In this paper, we present a novel two-layer hierarchical policy learning framework that builds on intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for the task of robotic object search.", "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Robotic Object Search (ROS) over the recent years with deep reinforcement learning based approaches, the sparsity issue in reward setting as well as the lack of interpretability of the previous ROS approaches leave much to be desired.

The high-level policy does subgoal selection, whereas the low-level layer handles explicit control. Notably, the low-level policy is trained to be aware of both the subgoal and the final goal. The authors conducted a series of ablations, demonstrating the value of training the low-level policy to be final goal-aware, and empirically demonstrated the strength of their method compared to other baselines.\n\nDecision: Weak Reject. The idea is intuitive and seems to be empirically successful (on some metrics). My primary concern is that the work appears incremental when compared to the baselines HRL and HRL with Stop. \n\nI think the acceptability of the paper is contingent on whether the tuning of alpha is considered a sufficiently significant contribution. The authors themselves noted that their method (alpha = 1) is similar to HRL---differing only in the introduction of a termination signal. This in and of itself suggests that the main contribution of the paper boils down to learning a suitable choice of alpha to manage the termination signal. \n\nI would also like to better understand the distinction between the author\u2019s method versus HRL with Stop. Both methods have employ a low-level network capable of pre-emptive stopping. How, then, is the termination signal for HRL with Stop trained?\n\nIf the authors can convincingly demonstrate the novelty of the proposal to learn the terminal signal via extrinsic reward supervision, and if the other reviewers feel similarly convinced, then I would feel more comfortable re-evaluating my concerns about the significance of this work.\n\nI would also, in general, encourage a more thoughtful exposition of the results shown in Table 1. Can the authors posit/explain why, for example, High-Level Only performs so much better on AS than the other models, but so poorly on the other metrics?
