Congratulations! \n\nBTW, we had two pieces of work which are highly related (In other words, curricula learning and example weighting are highly related). Our work studied the **implicit example weighting introduced by a loss's derivative and back-propagation** when optimising a model using gradient descent. \n1. IMAE for Noise-Robust Learning: Mean Absolute Error Does Not Treat Examples Equally and Gradient Magnitude's Variance Matters https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12141\n2. Derivative Manipulation for General Example Weighting https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11233\n\nIn a nutshell, a Curricula (i.e., learning order of data points), regardless of being implicit or explicit, will be influenced by the **implicit example weighting  introduced by a loss function**, especially when the derative is non-monotonic with respect to the loss value. \n\n\nI think it will be very interesting to discuss them in the paper or study them together in the future work. \nI am looking forward to your ideas, or further discussion if you are available. \n\n\nMany thanks and kind regards.

The paper progresses nicely through a sequence of well-thought research questions and experiments, with the key findings stated up front. In particular, the notion of \"implicit curriculum\" is shown to exist. Prior findings around when CL is helpful (limited training, label noise) are confirmed, which is nice. Overall, this methodical empirical evaluation comes away with a clear set of takeaways, empirically \"summarizing\" a lot of prior work on CL and the training of deep models. Some discussion about why CL helps when training is limited or data has label noise (or next steps) would strengthen the paper a bit more.\n\nStrengths:\n  + Extremely well-written and easy to read. Key findings are summarized and visualized up front.\n  + Well-designed large-scale empirical investigation into important open questions for training image classifiers.\n\nAreas for improvement\n  - Can't think of too many. I suppose the paper could have included a bit more discussion into why the reduced training or label noise benefits from curriculum learning. I'm also curious to see how these findings compare with a similar study on sequence (especially text) data but as the paper mentions, it's outside the scope of this paper.\n  - A pointer up front directing the reader to the appendix where \"standard training\" is defined would have been nice to have.\n\nQuestions:\n  * On Page 5, I didn't follow the sentence \"Given **these pacing functions**, we can now ask if the explicit curricula enforced by them can change the order in which examples are learned.\". I agree that Fig 3-right shows that the difficulty ordering (e2d, rand, d2e) can change the order in which examples are learned when using the step pacing function. What other pacing functions are used in Fig 3-right? Is there a different interpretation of the sentence involving the pacing functions?\n\nMinor comments\n  - A few typos\n    - Fig 2's caption (\"ReseNet50\", \"EfficeientNet\")\n    - Page 6 (\"CIAFR10\")\n\n\nUPDATE: I thank the authors for their detailed response and updated paper.

This includes investigating the phenomenon of implicit curricula, showing if the examples are learned in a consistent order across different architectures, and exploring the influences of explicit curricula in the standard and emulation settings. The paper empirically shows that curriculum learning has marginal benefits for standard training, but is helpful when the training time is limited or the training data is noisy.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score: \n\nI vote for accepting the paper. I believe the analyses presented in the paper can be valuable for the community. I like the implicit curricula experiments, showing that the difficulty of an example is somewhat independent of the training method. Other empirical observations are also interesting. In general, I think the paper provides a satisfactory answer to the question raised in the paper title (when do curricula work?) \n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros: \n\nThis paper has extremely comprehensive evaluations, examining the influence of curriculum learning (curriculum/anti-curriculum/random-curriculum) in diverse settings (standard/limited training time budget/noisy data). The methodology for the evaluations is technically sound;\n\nThe findings presented in the paper can be valuable for the community: (1) the difficulty of an example is somewhat independent of the training method; (2) curriculum learning provides little benefit for standard training, but help for limited time and noisy training;\n\nThe paper is well written. It is a thoroughly enjoyable experience to read the paper.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\nI found few weaknesses in the paper. I include a question below which I hope could be clarified:\n\nThe learned iteration of a sample is defined by the first epoch from which the prediction remains correct for all subsequent epochs. I wonder if there is any sample that is predicted correctly in earlier steps but incorrectly in later steps (e.g.  the forgettable examples). How to handle them in the implicit curricula experiment?\n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nMinor comments: \n\nPage 16: two data loader \u2192 two data loaders\n\n#########################################################################\n\nFinal recommendation:\n\nI have read the authors' responses as well as the comments from my fellow reviewers.

In summary:\n\nFigure 13 in the original submission plots the distribution of the loss-based c-score for CIFAR100 with and without label noise. For the distribution of clean CIFAR100, a significant number of images concentrate around zero.  However, the concentration slowly shifts to larger values as the label noise increases. In the updated version (Figure 9), we also computed c-score distributions for reduced time clean CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 training. We also find that the c-score distribution shifts to the right as training time is decreased. As c-score is intended to measure the difficulty of examples, this suggests that both label noise and reduced time training shift the c-score distributions towards more difficult examples and that curricula can help by focusing first on easier examples.\n\n2.\"A pointer up front directing the reader to the appendix where \"standard training\" is defined would have been nice to have.\"\n\nWe have now included this (see footnote 1 on page 2).\n\n3.\"On Page 5, I didn't follow the sentence\u2026\"\n\nWe thank you for pointing out the confusion.
