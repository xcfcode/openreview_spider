The comments 3/4/5 from authors convincingly address my concerns. Regarding other classifier-based metrics, note that not all of them requires separate training and testing procedure. For example, the leave-one-out 1-NN accuracy [1] does not. Also, I'm still not sure about the technical novelty. Therefore, I keep my original rating.\n\n[1] Xu, Qiantong, et al. \"An empirical study on evaluation metrics of generative adversarial networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.07755 (2018).\n\n---------\n\nThis paper proposes generator architecture for image inpainting using co-modulation, which is similar to the weight modulation in StyleGAN2 but is conditioned on both the input image and the stochastic variable instead of only the stochastic variable.\n\n\nPros:\n+ The paper is well-written and easy to read.\n+ The proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline DeepFillv2. The results look qualitatively convincing.\n\nCons: \n- The novelty of this paper is a bit limited. It seems to me that the proposed co-modulation is a straightforward extension of conditional modulation with stochasticity. \n- It seems most of the improvement over DeepFillv2 is from the better and larger network backbone (StyleGAN2). The improvement from conditional modulation is a bit small (Table 5 in the appendix).\n- In Figure 5, the authors argue that KID is subject to huge variance. However, it is not clear to me if KID really has a larger variance than FID. Figure 6 shows that FID and KID have very similar (relative) variance. It is argued that KID can hardly distinguish w=1 vs w=2. But from Figure 4 right, it seems to me that FID has the same problem too.\n \nQuestions for the rebuttal:\n- What is the running time of the proposed classification-based metrics?\n- The proposed co-modulation follows the \u201clate-fusion\u201d strategy: processing the image and random information independently, then concatenate them before modulation. Is it helpful to fuse them earlier, using an MLP to process the concatenated information before modulation?\n- The paper argues that \"however, to the best of our knowledge, we are the \ufb01rst to formulate the discriminability as \u03c8 a simple scalable metric\" when discussing other classifier-based metrics. I'm not totally convinced why the proposed metric is more scalable than other ones, e.g., the two-sample test. It would be great if you could elaborate on that.\n\nOverall, I find the empirical results of the paper are pretty impressive. The technical novelty is however a bit lacking.

The proposed method employs a co-modulation technique to bridge the gap between conditional and unconditional GANs. It can then take the advantages from both sides with the consistency offered by conditional GANs and stochasticity provided by the unconditional GANs. The paper also proposes new image quality metrics, Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Scores (P-IDS/U-IDS), for measuring the image quality of the inpainted images. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms DeepFillv2, a state-of-the-art freeform image completion method, on examples with large missing regions. Overall, I like the idea and the paper\u2019s results. It represents a clear progress to the image completion problem with large missing regions. \n\n**Strengths**\n+ The idea is novel and makes sense. It is simple yet effective to the target problem. The idea of extending modulation to co-modulation is interesting. The co-modulation architecture design allows the proposed method to explore the generation capability of the unconditional GANs while maintaining the consistency of the completed image.\n+ The results are excellent. The paper and the appendix's visual results show that the proposed method can inpaint images with large missing regions very well. \n+ The paper is generally well-written. Figure 2 illustrates the basic idea very well. \n\n**Weaknesses**\n- Although the experiments show a good correlation of the proposed P-IDS/U-IDS metrics to the user study results, it is not clear how well the metrics reflect perceptual fidelity. Do these metrics work best for measuring the quality of inpainted images? How were the fake images generated for fitting the linear SVM? Is it possible to generalize to other image restoration problems?   \n- Although the main target is image completion, the paper claims that the proposed co-modulated GANs also works well on image-to-image translation. However, the paper only demonstrates the application on a simple edge2image problem, from edge images to commodity images. It would be better if the paper presents more image-to-image translation examples for validating how well the proposed method can handle image-to-image translation.\n\n**Post-rebuttal**\n\nThe rebuttal addresses the raised issues. An experiment supports the generalizability of the proposed metric. A new image-to-image translation experiment on COCO-Stuff is added. It shows the proposed method's potential for other translation tasks (the results are in Fig. 16, not Fig. 15). Taking the rebuttal and other reviews into account, I would like to recommend accepting the paper for its excellent results and simple yet effective idea. \n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1061/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1061/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Large Scale Image Completion via Co-Modulated Generative Adversarial Networks", "authorids": ["~Shengyu_Zhao1", "~Jonathan_Cui1", "simon1727@qq.com", "dongyue8@gmail.com", "liangx@rdfz.cn", "echang@microsoft.com", "~Yan_Xu2"], "authors": ["Shengyu Zhao", "Jonathan Cui", "Yilun Sheng", "Yue Dong", "Xiao Liang", "Eric I-Chao Chang", "Yan Xu"], "keywords": ["image completion", "generative adversarial networks", "co-modulation"], "abstract": "Numerous task-specific variants of conditional generative adversarial networks have been developed for image completion.

I think the exposition is outdated and does not consider new work published at CVPR 2020, ECCV 2020, and possibly other venues.\nThe paper \"Recurrent Feature Reasoning for Image Inpainting\" explicitely points out \"However, filling in large continuous holes remains difficult due to the lack of constraints for the hole center.\" and the results seem to show many examples of inpaiting for large missing regions.\n\"Image2StyleGAN++ ...\" show the inpainting of large regions as application and specifically mention the large-scale inpainting problem.\n\"Image Fine-grained Inpainting\" states that \"Benefited from the property of this network, we can more easily recover large regions in an incomplete image\"\n\"DeepGIN: Deep Generative Inpainting Network for Extreme Image Inpainting\" even mentions the problem of large missing regions in the title of the paper.\nThere are also other inpainting papers that one should look at. I didn't check the publication date or the relationship in detail at this point in time: \"Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature Equalizations\", \"Deep Generative Model for Image Inpainting with Local Binary Pattern Learning and Spatial Attention\", \"Deep Generative Model for Image Inpainting with Local Binary Pattern Learning and Spatial Attention\", \"Encoding in Style: a StyleGAN Encoder for Image-to-Image Translation\".\nMain concern for this submission is the literature research and I would like to see this addressed in the rebuttal.\n\nThe paper proposes an architecture modification the authors call co-modulation. The idea is to have the normalization of the generator layers not only controlled by either a random vector, or an input image, but by both. I think this overall idea is clear, but the details (including Fig. 3) are not that clear. I would say it's a nice, but smaller idea, that is suitable for publication if it leads to good results.\n\nThe paper also proposes a new way to evaluate GANs using the proposed P-IDS and U-IDS score. The main idea here is to use a pre-trained feature transformation (the inception network) on real and fake images and then to evaluate the images using a linear classifier.\nI do not think the evaluation strategy of masking a random square of size wxw is that convincing.

Generalizability of the proposed P-IDS/U-IDS**\n\nWe have tested P-IDS/U-IDS in a new image-to-image translation experiment on COCO-Stuff in the revision (see Table 3). This experiment shows that our metric is generalizable to image-to-image translation and correlates well to human preferences even more than FID. Beyond image-to-image translation, we believe that U-IDS is also a good alternative to FID for assessing unconditional GANs. For example, on FFHQ, we test that the U-IDS of StyleGAN is 17.4%, and the U-IDS of StyleGAN2 is 27.8%. This could be potentially more intuitive than their difference in FID.\n\n**2. How were the fake images generated for fitting the linear SVM?**\n\nIn Figs. 4-6, we use the manipulated real images with the corresponding manipulation strategies as detailed in Section 4 as the fake images for fitting the linear SVM. In the image completion experiments, the fake images are the inpainted images generated by the model.\n\n**2. More image-to-image translation experiments**\n\nWe have conducted a new image-to-image translation experiment on COCO-Stuff in the revision (see Table 3 and Fig. 15). The user study, P-IDS, U-IDS, and FID consistently validate our superiority over SPADE.

Literature research**\n\nWe agree that the problem that current methods are incapable of inpainting large-scale missing regions has been noticed by multiple works, but this problem still remains unsolved. Qualitatively, all those methods mentioned by the reviewer [1-7] either require sparsely masked regions to achieve reasonable results, or generate significant artifacts even when a single medium-scale region is being masked, no matter how they state their statements. Quantitatively, we evaluate the official released models of RFR [1] but get poor results (see our Table 1 in the revision). Since they have not released the Places2 model, we use their Paris StreetView model for Places2 evaluation and their CelebA model for FFHQ evaluation. This comparison is not totally fair but does have some implications.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Li et al. \"Recurrent Feature Reasoning for Image Inpainting.\" CVPR 2020.\n\n[2] Abdal et al. \"Image2StyleGAN++: How to Edit the Embedded Images?\" CVPR 2020.\n\n[3] Hui et al. \"Image fine-grained inpainting.\" arXiv preprint.\n\n[4] Li et al. \"DeepGIN: Deep Generative Inpainting Network for Extreme Image Inpainting.\" arXiv preprint.\n\n[5] Liu et al. \"Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature Equalizations.\" ECCV 2020.\n\n[6] Wu et al. \"Deep Generative Model for Image Inpainting with Local Binary Pattern Learning and Spatial Attention.\" arXiv preprint.\n\n[7] Richardson et al. \"Encoding in Style: a StyleGAN Encoder for Image-to-Image Translation.\" arXiv preprint.\n\n**2.

Novelty**\n\nDespite the simplicity and intuitiveness of co-modulation, we believe that this is an important step to bridge the stochastic generative capability from unconditional to image-conditional GANs.\n\n\n**2. Ablation study of co-modulation**\n\nHow to utilize a better unconditional GAN backbone (e.g., StyleGAN2) for solving image completion has been non-trivial and is the focus of this work. Our ablation study (now Table 6 in the appendix) indicates that the Vanilla version (i.e., without modulation) of the StyleGAN2 backbone completely fails. Although the conditional modulation (C-Mod) variant also achieves reasonable performance, even this strategy has not been realized in the image completion literature, while our co-modulation approach (Co-Mod) dominates its performance especially when the masked ratio becomes large.\n\n\n**3. Variance of KID and FID**\n\nWe agree that FID also has the problem of large relative variance before convergence. We have clarified this in the revision.\n\n\n**4. Running time of the proposed metric**\n\nP-IDS/U-IDS incurs mild computational overhead in addition to the feature extraction process. For example, with 10k samples, extracting the Inception features on an NVIDIA P100 GPU takes 221s, and fitting the SVM (which only uses CPU) takes an extra of 88s. With 50k samples, the feature extraction process and the SVM take 1080s and 886s respectively. We have included this in the revision.\n\n\n**5. Is it helpful to fuse the conditional and stochastic information earlier?**\n\nWe tried to feed the conditional information $\\mathcal{E}(\\mathbf{y})$ into the mapping network together with the latent vector $\\mathbf{z}$ but did not observe clear improvement. On the other hand, our \u201clate-fusion\u201d strategy enables easy trade-off between quality and diversity by linearly magnifying the stochastic term right before modulation; there would not be an easy way to do this if we fuse them earlier when they are highly entangled.\n\n\n**6. Discussion about other classifier-based metrics**\n\nPrevious classifier-based metrics (e.g., C2ST-NN/KNN used in the two-sample test) require separate sets for training and testing the classifier. This makes them sensitive to the underlying generalizability of the trained classifier, e.g., whether a model may receive a good score depends not only on the fidelity of its generated images but also on the degree to which the classifier overfits the sampled training set. In comparison, we restrict the classifier to be a simple linear model, which shares with distance-based metrics (like FID and KID) the same property that a given set of features can be measured without relying on the generalizability. We are also the first to formulate the paired discriminability as a scalable metric (P-IDS). We have clarified this in the revision.\n\nWe have also listed our major changes in our general response above.

Also, due to the lack of good quantitative metrics for image completion, we propose the new Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P-IDS/U-IDS), which robustly measures the perceptual fidelity of inpainted images compared to real images via linear separability in a feature space. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in terms of both quality and diversity over state-of-the-art methods in free-form image completion and easy generalization to image-to-image translation.
