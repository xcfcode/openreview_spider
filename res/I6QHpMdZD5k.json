The simulation time really depends on the mesh size. For a large device, typically hours are needed to get the solution. We hope that it can partially address your second comment.\n\nFinally, regarding the number of inference runs, our response to the Reviewer#2 is copied below. Rough guess for the total inference runs can be made:\n\n\"The total number would be determined by a product between the number of users and the number of simulation runs per user. When we consider an academic research group, the user number would be 1 - 10 and the run number per user would be 10 - 100. Therefore, it is really a small number. However, when we consider a semiconductor company developing the next-generation technology, the number increases drastically. The user number would be (at least) 10 - 100. More importantly, an engineer can easily submit 100 - 1000 runs every day during the technology development period. Therefore, in the case of a semiconductor company, the additional cost spent by the developer group can be well justified.\"\n\nThank you for your efforts in reviewing our manuscript.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Solve Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation Systems To Accelerate MOSFET Simulation", "authorids": ["~Seungcheol_Han1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Sung-Min_Hong1"], "authors": ["Seungcheol Han", "Jonghyun Choi", "Sung-Min Hong"], "keywords": ["Partial differential equation", "nonlinear equation", "Newton-Raphson method", "convolutional neural network"], "abstract": "Semiconductor device simulation uses numerical analysis, where a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved with the iterative Newton-Raphson method.

To do so, the authors construct a \"device template\" which parametrizes the design space. The CNN then maps a device configuration in this 6-dim space to the predicted electrostatic potential in the form of a 64x64 grid. The authors provide an analysis showing why predicting the electrostatic potential alone is sufficient. Overall, this approach can provide a simulation speedup of 12x or more. The authors are also planning to publish the dataset generated for the paper.\n\nThe idea to take a data-driven approach to compute the initial approximate solution in the context of the semiconductor simulation domain is interesting. Most prior work utilizing ML to accelerate PDE solution tried to generate such solutions directly. The path taken here, while seemingly easier, is interesting from an application point of view in that the solver is still used as before, potentially alleviating concerns about the validity of ML-accelerated solutions. The claimed order of magnitude speedup is significant (but see below for some comments on this). The main downside of the paper is the very limited novelty on the ML front (off-the-shelf generator from the DC-GAN paper) and demonstrated applicability to a specific and relatively narrow domain. As such, I recommend against publication at ICLR, and would advise the authors to submit the paper to a venue where the presented advances are likely to be of wider interest.\n\nOne specific point that I believe should be addressed, is to clarify the cost of building the dataset (10k simulations) and training the network, and its impact on the effective simulation speedup. As is, the 12x speedup would seem to apply in the limit of a very large number of network inference runs, and it is unclear if this is a practically relevant setting.\n\nSuggestions for improvements:\n- Explain to the reader explicitly why this is a 2d problem while the device exists in 3d space.\n- What specifically was the validation set used for?\n- In the text it is stated that \"grid spacing is adjusted\". Please explain more how this is done.\n- The text states that the network was trained with backprop. Which specific optimizer was used, and with which hyperparameters?\n- Including parts of the explanations currently in appendix B could make the text clearer and easier to read for people from outside of your field (e.g. the importance of bias ramping, and its relation to the simulation cost).\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Solve Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation Systems To Accelerate MOSFET Simulation", "authorids": ["~Seungcheol_Han1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Sung-Min_Hong1"], "authors": ["Seungcheol Han", "Jonghyun Choi", "Sung-Min Hong"], "keywords": ["Partial differential equation", "nonlinear equation", "Newton-Raphson method", "convolutional neural network"], "abstract": "Semiconductor device simulation uses numerical analysis, where a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved with the iterative Newton-Raphson method.

The submission speeds up the simulation by reducing the problem to a lookup of a electrostatic field as a function of 6 parameters of a MOSFET (two doping levels, oxide thickness, the gate length, V_DD, and V_g).\n\nHowever, the application doesn't seem to require a convolutional network.. the input space is only 6-dimensional, so simple techniques ought to work well. When I run into low-dimensional problems like this, I use local linear regression. [1] Namely:\n\n1. Scale each input to lie in [0,1]\n2. Choose a distance h in the 6-dimensional scaled input space (via cross-validating the following procedure)\n3. For any test point, find N points that lie within distance h of the test point\n4. Do weighted linear regression on those N points, with the tricube weighting function scaled to have support h [2]\n5. Evaluate the linear regression once for each output position.\n\nNote that in step 4, you form a NxN correlation matrix once, and perform a Cholesky decomposition on it. Then, for each position in the electrostatic output, you only need to do backsubstitution, which is O(N^2). \n\nThis would be the standard way of solving such a problem. You'd have to show that the neural network was substantially better or cheaper than this technique.\n\nAnother issue is with exactly how you measure the 12x speedup. That speedup time ignores the ~10,000 times you have to run the simulator to generate the training data. If the simulator is run only on the 1,000 test samples, then the simulator has actually slowed down by 10x (i.e., it's cheaper to not generate the training set and only simulate on the test samples). How many times is the simulator expected to run? If the simulator will run 100,000 times (e.g.), then it could be that the 5-d space is sampled densely enough where you can simply perform a nearest neighbor computation and return the electrostatic field out of memory, and do absolutely no interpolation or simulaion.\n\nReferences.\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Solve Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation Systems To Accelerate MOSFET Simulation", "authorids": ["~Seungcheol_Han1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Sung-Min_Hong1"], "authors": ["Seungcheol Han", "Jonghyun Choi", "Sung-Min Hong"], "keywords": ["Partial differential equation", "nonlinear equation", "Newton-Raphson method", "convolutional neural network"], "abstract": "Semiconductor device simulation uses numerical analysis, where a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved with the iterative Newton-Raphson method.

We will upload the revised manuscript by the end of the discussion stage 1 (November 17). \n\nIn this time, point-by-point responses are provided. \n\n\u2022\tAs pointed out by the reviewer correctly, it takes a long time to construct the training data set. Therefore, the hidden efforts to construct the training data set should be considered, if the device simulator is used only by the one who actually performs the training. We agree that it is not effective. However, it is noted that the semiconductor device simulator is typically developed by a developer group -- a company or a research group -- and distributed over several end users. The important metric is not the training time spent by the developer but the simulation time experienced by the end user.  For an end user, 12 times (or even larger) speedup is very attractive. \n\n\u2022\tThank you for pointing out the 3D problem. The planar MOSFET has the translational symmetry along the third direction. In other words, every physical quantity does not change along the third direction, which is perpendicular to the plane. (See Figure 1(a) and 1(c), for example.) Of course, the state-of-the-art MOSFETs have complex 3D geometry. However, it is beyond our scope in this work. Coping the 3D MOSFET is a very challenging future research topic. \n\n\u2022\tAccording to many valuable suggestions by the reviewer for improvements, the revised manuscript will be prepared. \n\nFinally, thank you for your kind advice to submit our manuscript to other venues. Certainly, we will prepare a manuscript, which is more focused on the application aspect. However, we strongly believe that solving a set of coupled partial differential equations is an important emerging application field even from the machine learning society.  \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Solve Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation Systems To Accelerate MOSFET Simulation", "authorids": ["~Seungcheol_Han1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Sung-Min_Hong1"], "authors": ["Seungcheol Han", "Jonghyun Choi", "Sung-Min Hong"], "keywords": ["Partial differential equation", "nonlinear equation", "Newton-Raphson method", "convolutional neural network"], "abstract": "Semiconductor device simulation uses numerical analysis, where a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved with the iterative Newton-Raphson method.

Thank you for your suggestion. \n\n\u2022\tFor the second comment, as pointed out by the reviewer correctly, it takes a long time to construct the training data set. Therefore, the hidden efforts to construct the training data set should be considered, if the device simulator is used only by the one who actually performs the training. We agree that it is not effective. However, it is noted that the semiconductor device simulator is typically developed by a developer group -- a company or a research group -- and distributed over several end users. Although the number of simulation runs by a single end user can vary depending on his/her need, the total number would be very large. Moreover, since we are interested with the end users, the dense sampling of the input space is not feasible. Therefore, it is desirable for the developer group to distribute a semiconductor device simulation with a trained neural network. The above discussion will be added in the revised manuscript, in order to clarify the motivation of this work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper749/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to Solve Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation Systems To Accelerate MOSFET Simulation", "authorids": ["~Seungcheol_Han1", "~Jonghyun_Choi1", "~Sung-Min_Hong1"], "authors": ["Seungcheol Han", "Jonghyun Choi", "Sung-Min Hong"], "keywords": ["Partial differential equation", "nonlinear equation", "Newton-Raphson method", "convolutional neural network"], "abstract": "Semiconductor device simulation uses numerical analysis, where a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is solved with the iterative Newton-Raphson method.

The experiment on the MOSFET problem shows that, compared with the conventional numerical solver, this hybrid strategy can accelerate the simulation by more than 12 times.\n\nPros:\n- The proposed hybrid method speeds up the simulation a lot without a sacrifice of accuracy.\n\nMajor comments:\n- This idea of using CNN to output a good initial guess is not new and has been proposed, e.g., in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04485 . So there is little contribution in the method.\n- The problem considered in the paper is a 2D rectangle domain, which can be handled by CNN nicely. However, in practice this may not be true. The authors should consider more complex domains. For example, in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.026 CNN is used for complex 2D geometry. In https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04502 neural network is used to solve Poisson equation in a L-shape domain, which should also be discussed in Section 2.1.\n- This paper has no contribution in machine leaning, and instead it is an application for solving PDEs.
