A plot demonstrating the tradeoff of \naccuracy for compression (by varying Href or other parameters) would provide a more complete picture of performance. Knowing baseline performance (without active inference) would help put numbers in perspective by providing a performance bound due to modeling choices.\n\u2013\u00a0What does the distribution of number of saccades required per recognition (for a given threshold) look like over the entire dataset, i.e. how many are dead-easy vs difficult?\n\u2013 Steady state assumption: How can this be relaxed to further generalize to non-static scenes?\n\u2013 Figure 3 is low resolution and difficult to read.\n\nPost-rebuttal comments:\n\nI have revised my score after considering comments from other reviewers and the revised paper.

Sorry to insist but the predictive policy presented in this paper is a direct derivation of Friston active inference principle (minimize Evidence lower bound with action). The trick is to consider the latent state as coding for the entire scene (which only visible in parts). Each partial view thus allows to refine the estimation of z, which in turn makes the next perception less \"surprising\" (i.e. lowers E_q -log P(x|z, u) for all u). So please reconsider your statement for it is quite deceiving to other reviewers and readers. \nNext the Free Energy principle is a coding optimization principle so it is neither blind or watchful to rewards, it depends how you formulate your problem (this being not the subject though). \nThe active inference framework is not \"much different\" for it has tight relations with the active vision litterature and grounds on the same probabilistic framework (partial observation of a scene, bayesian inference etc..). The static simplification is also extremely classic and present in most cited papers, so it is not unusual at all. This is finally quite a bunch of surprising comments though not critically related to the actual content of the paper!\n \nNext the fovea-based model is given with full implementation detail. Pages 5-6 provide everything needed to reproduce the numerical experiments. \nLast, more comparisons with existing models should indeed be done though there is little room for improvement in the current setting. The missing part/future work  being comparing inhibition of return simplification with trajectory-based optimization. \n\nWe also tried to better separate in the new version the review part from the contributions.

The active vision/sensing problem has been well studied and both the information theory and Bayes risk formulations have already been considered in previous works (see Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; Butko and Movellan, 2010; Ahmad and Yu, 2013).\n\nThe paper is also rife with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and needs a thorough revision. Examples: foveate inspection the data (abstract), may allow to (motivation), tu put it clear (motivation), on contrary to animals retina (footnote 1), minimize at most the current uncertainty (perception-driven control), center an keep (fovea-based implementation), degrade te recognition (outlook and perspective). The citations are in non-standard format (section 1.2: Kalman (1960)).\n\nOverall, I think the paper considers an important problem but the contribution to the state of the art is minimal, and editing highly lacking. \n\n1.

This may coincide with the recognition accuracy in special cases, but should fail in most cases (as already pointed out in 2. and 3). In contrast, papers 2 and 3 are about trajectory-based policy optimization with policy learned from a continuous belief vector with function approximators (namely Policy gradient in 2., Monte Carlo/RBF in 3.).\nIn our case the policy is not learned but directly processed (optimized) from the generative model. The trick is to do a local optimization using a \u201ctwo-steps ahead\u201d prediction that predicts the next posterior (the effect of the next observation), consistently with Friston\u2019s active inference/predictive coding approach. Another substantial difference is our scene decoding/feature selection approach that contrasts with the standard visual search tasks and provides a link with classical ML setups. \nThose references will be included in the final version with appropriate comments / comparisons.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Toward predictive machine learning for active vision", "abstract": "We develop a comprehensive description of the active inference framework, as proposed by Friston (2010), under a machine-learning compliant perspective.

By the way surprise reduction is an objective in itself that can be set up as a reward (an \u2018intrinsic\u2019 reward) with possible connections with reinforcement learning \u201cextrinsic\u201d rewards and action optimization.\nSecond, the steady state assumption (nothing changes in the scene) is not that uncommon in active vision (see previous comment). Maybe are you puzzled by the difference between a visual scene (the entire image) that doesn\u2019t change (but is covered) and and a view (which is the current perception given viewpoint u) which changes at each saccade?\nThird, a comparison with low-level Itti & Koch saliency models is not relevant here for the MNIST images are not \u201cnatural\u201d enough (no texture, flat background etc.). The saliency maps that we build relate to the critical viewpoints where discriminating features are expected (high-level / recognition oriented saliency maps).  \nAdditional details should be put in the final version regarding the effect of H_ref on classification rates, the comparison with baseline (full image) recognition, random saccades, two-steps ahead predictive policy and pre-processed (high-level saliency maps based) policyn, see : \nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1wFvPUgiN7ekaAaIAQ5KMHgA-H0plttv2\nLast remark : the apparent realism of the saccades relates to the full image coverage but you are right this is not quantified here. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Toward predictive machine learning for active vision", "abstract": "We develop a comprehensive description of the active inference framework, as proposed by Friston (2010), under a machine-learning compliant perspective.
