Description of the complete system:\nThanks. We have added more detailed description of the complete system in the revised version. Please kindly refer to the second paragraph of Section 1 and Section 3.1 for a description of our complete system and global picture, including classification part. Detailed discussion on classification was included in the \u201cMulti-label classification\u201d paragraph of Section 3.2 and \u201cFine-tuning on generated features\u201d paragraph of Section 3.3.\n\nComment #2. Emphasis that the classes come with a short text description:\nThanks. We have added the emphasis of this fact in both Section 1 and Section 3.1 in the revision. \n\nComment #3. \u201c3.1 is related to feature extraction... is also apply to class description.\u201d\nAs explained in \u201cLabel-wise feature extraction\u201d paragraph of Section 3.2 in the revised version (3.1 in the previous version), we process the label description in the feature extractor so as to extract label-wise features for each document. For an input document, a total of |L| feature vectors are extracted and each feature vector contains the relevant information to each label description in the set of labels L. \n\nComment #4. \u201c3.2 label encoder : if the notations... help understanding.\u201d\nThanks. We have updated figure 1 with the Label encoder. Other notations in the figure are consistent with the text.\n\nComment #5. \u201cResults : the claim \u2018our methods improve the F1 score from nearly 0 to 20.91% for the zero-shot codes\u2019 is not true\u201d\nWe would like to point out that Xian2018 and Felix2018 are published works on image classification in the computer vision research community, not on ICD coding. The only existing baseline on the generalized zero-shot ICD coding is Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s work and their F1 score is nearly zero. We are the first to propose the adversarial generative model with hierarchical label structure for the GZSL text classification problem and achieved ~21% F1.\n\nEven compared with Xian2018 and Felix2018, our final model has achieved significant improvement. We have performed student-t test on micro F1 scores. The p-values are 0.00018 and 0.014 comparing to Xian2018 and Felix2018, indicating the improvement between our final model and prior works are statistically significant.\n\nComment #6. \u201cWhen looking at Figure 3 and the analysis... impact on the classification results (F1 20.48 versus F1 20.30)\u201d\nWe conducted student-t test on micro F1 scores from WGAN-Z and WGAN and the p-value is 0.01 which demonstrates that the improvement of WGAN-Z is statistically significant.\nThe goal of Figure 3 is to show that features generated for zero-shot codes using WGAN-Z are closer to the real features from the nearest sibling codes, which indicates that using WGAN-Z can generate features that better preserve the ICD hierarchy. \n\nComment #7. \u201cIt seems that the proposed methods make the model more complex without bringing a significant improvements\u201d.\nAs mentioned above, via student-t test, we verified that the new modules proposed in our model yield statistically significant improvement over the baselines adapted from Xian2018 and Felix2018. Xian2018 and Felix2018 focused on image classification, instead of ICD coding in multi-label text classification, therefore they did not address several key challenges in zero-shot ICD coding: 1) The class label distribution is extremely long-tailed and there are many codes without labeled data. 2) The label space has complex hierarchical tree structure. 3) The input clinical documents are very long and noisy and the key information corresponding to each assigned code is quite sparse. \n\nTo solve these challenges, it is necessary to propose new ideas. Specifically, we proposed a novel conditional generative model with hierarchical label structure, which has three novel modules to address the three challenges.  1) our framework adversarially generates features for zero-shot codes and finetune the classifiers with the synthetic features, 2) we exploit the hierarchical tree of the ICD codes by encouraging the features of zero-shot codes to be similar to their siblings, 3) we reconstruct the code-relevant keywords in the input documents from the synthetic features to guarantee the semantic consistency.\n\nMore importantly, via significance tests, each of these proposed modules has demonstrated to be effective in improving ICD-coding performance. These modules together frame our novel approach, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first adversarial generative model with hierarchical label structure for generalized zero-shot ICD coding problem. Besides, compared with the only existing baseline on the generalized zero-shot ICD coding (Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s work), we improve the F1 score from nearly zero to ~21%.

We would like to address the specific comments below. \n\nComment #1. Relationship with previous work by Rios and Kavuluru:\nThanks for your detailed comment and we made it clearer about the relationship with the previous work by Rios and Kavuluru in the revised version (uploaded in OpenReview). Please kindly refer to the discussion of the limitations of Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s work in Section 2, and the discussion of the difference between ours and Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s work in the first paragraph of Section 3.2. We only use the modified Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s model to serve as the feature extractor and pretrained classifier for our proposed approach. As acknowledged by Reviewer 2, the modifications include: 1) replace the graph convolutional networks with graph recurrent neural network; 2) adopting the label-distribution-aware margin loss for training. The performance gain from our modification is added to Table 5 in Appendix E.\n\nBesides the above modification, we would like to highlight other differences of our framework to Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s: 1) our framework adversarially generates features for zero-shot codes to finetune the classifiers. 2) We exploit the tree structure of ICD codes by encouraging the synthetic features of zero-shot codes to be similar to their siblings 3), we reconstruct the code-relevant keywords in the input documents from the synthetic features to guarantee the semantic consistency.  To conclude, we are the first to propose the adversarial generative model with hierarchical label structure for the generalized zero-shot text classification problem and the whole framework is brand new compared with Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s work.\n\nComment #2. Clarify the comment regarding the independent training of the zero-shot cases vs the rest:\nBy independent training we mean that we only fine-tune the binary classifiers for zero-shot codes with the synthetic features while keeping the pretrained classifier for the rest of the codes fixed. Please kindly refer to the explanation in the last paragraph of Section 3.1 and Section 3.3, and \u201cresults on seen codes\u201d paragraph of Section 4.2. \n\nComment #3. Definition of siblings ICD codes:\nSibling codes are codes that share an immediate parent. Since each code can have more than one sibling, we select the nearest sibling code measured by the cosine similarity in the encoded label space. Please refer to \u201cDiscriminating zero-shot codes using ICD hierarchy\u201d paragraph in Section 3.3 for the detailed explanation.\n\nComment #4. Results in Table 1:\nThanks for your detailed comments and we are sorry for any confusion caused by the citation. Table 1 shows the performance of our modified feature extractor on the SEEN codes and these performance will remain the same after fine-tuning on zero-shot codes as we do not finetune on SEEN codes (explained in the last paragraph of Section 3.1 and Section 3.3, and \u201cresults on seen codes\u201d paragraph of Section 4.2). As explained for Comment #1, we modified Rios and Kavuluru\u2019s work to serve as the feature extractor and pretrained classifier for our generative framework. The first row in Table 1 shows the results for modified ZAGRNN, and the second row shows the results for modified ZAGRNN trained with label-distribution-aware margin loss. We will clarify this in the final version. \n\nComment #5. In Table 2, for the cases where precision and recall are 0, are the AUC numbers correct? \nPrecision and recall are 0 because the baseline model assign a very low probability to zero-shot codes and thus never predicts these codes on any input text given the default threshold of 0.5. AUC can be larger than the random guessing baseline of 0.5 as AUC is measured with all possible thresholds. \n\nComment #6. Explanation on what you considered few-shot cases for those results. \nThanks for your suggestion. Please find our detailed explanation about few-shot cases in the last paragraph \u201cResults on few-shot codes\u201d of Section 4.2.\n\nComment #7. I think the paper could improve the explanation of the components of the model and the presentation of the evaluation results.\nThanks for your suggestion. We will carefully improve the explanation of the model components and the presentation of the evaluation results in the final version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["cs2296@cornell.edu", "shanghang.zhang@petuum.com", "najmeh.sadoughi@petuum.com", "pengtao.xie@petuum.com", "eric.xing@petuum.com"], "title": "Generalized Zero-shot ICD Coding", "authors": ["Congzheng Song", "Shanghang Zhang", "Najmeh Sadoughi", "Pengtao Xie", "Eric Xing"], "pdf": "/pdf/95b983d5d8e16719bd244e26ff040ea7b34d0ae0.pdf", "TL;DR": "To solve the generalized zero-shot ICD coding problem, we propose a generative model to generate features that preserve the semantics of the zero-shot codes and exploit the hierarchy structure of the label space.", "abstract": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a list of classification codes for the diagnoses.

We appreciate your positive feedback and address the specific questions below. \n\nComment #1 & #2. Degree of (effective) novelty:\nWe would like to emphasize that prior works on generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) mainly focused on visual tasks, the study of GZSL for multi-label text classification is largely under-explored.  Generalized zero-shot ICD coding is a much harder task and we cannot simply apply GAN-based method as in vision problem (e.g., Xian et al. 2018) or label-distribution-aware margin loss to solve it, due to the following aspects: 1) The label distribution is extremely long-tailed and it is challenging to perform multi-label classification on both seen codes and zero-shot codes. 2) The label space has complex hierarchical tree structure. 3) The input clinical documents are very long and noisy and the key information corresponding to each assigned code is quite sparse. \n\nTo solve the above challenges, we proposed a novel conditional generative model with hierarchical label structure. Our model has three new components to address the aforementioned three challenges. For the first challenge, our framework adversarially generates features for zero-shot codes to finetune the classifiers. For the second challenge, we exploit the tree structure of ICD codes by encouraging the features of zero-shot codes to be similar to their siblings. For the third challenge, we reconstruct the code-relevant keywords in the input documents from the synthetic features to guarantee the semantic consistency. These three model components were not contained in the model of Xian et al. (2018).\n\nEach module contributed to the improved performance, and all of them together frame our novel approach, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first adversarial generative model with hierarchical label structure for generalized zero-shot ICD coding problem. \n\nRegarding the effectiveness, we have performed student-t test comparing our final model against previous GAN based approach on micro F1 scores. The p-values are 0.00018 and 0.014 comparing to Xian2018 and Felix2018, indicating the differences between our results and prior works are statistically significant.\n\nQuestion #1. Could the model benefit from having a self-attention model, like a transformer? \nThe clinical documents are very long and each document can have thousands of tokens.  We use 1D convolution for feature extraction mainly because it is most efficient to train for long text. Current state of the art transformer models (BERT, GPT-2) are all trained on sentence level inputs and are extremely memory consuming for longer sequences[1], mainly due to the n x n self-attention matrix in each layer where n is the number of tokens. It is an interesting future direction to explore whether we can perform efficient training and feature extraction with more advanced encoder models like transformers on long clinical texts. \n\nQuestion #2. Could the precision-recall curves be added to the supplementary material?\nThanks for your constructive suggestion. We added the Precision-recall curves to Appendix D of the revised version (uploaded in OpenReview).\n\nReference\n[1] https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md#out-of-memory-issues"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["cs2296@cornell.edu", "shanghang.zhang@petuum.com", "najmeh.sadoughi@petuum.com", "pengtao.xie@petuum.com", "eric.xing@petuum.com"], "title": "Generalized Zero-shot ICD Coding", "authors": ["Congzheng Song", "Shanghang Zhang", "Najmeh Sadoughi", "Pengtao Xie", "Eric Xing"], "pdf": "/pdf/95b983d5d8e16719bd244e26ff040ea7b34d0ae0.pdf", "TL;DR": "To solve the generalized zero-shot ICD coding problem, we propose a generative model to generate features that preserve the semantics of the zero-shot codes and exploit the hierarchy structure of the label space.", "abstract": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a list of classification codes for the diagnoses.

The main idea of the paper is to use GANs to generate latent features for the text conditioned on the ICD codes and taking into account the tree-like structure of the ICD codes themselves. The classification of ICD codes is trained on the GAN-extracted features.\n\nThe input clinical document is represented as a concatenation of its word embeddings. The representation of an ICD code is realized by averaging the embeddings of the words in its corresponding description. The feature extraction model takes the word embeddings from the input text and passes them through a CNN; in addition, attention is used for the encodings of all the ICD codes.\n\nFor further encoding the ICD codes, the tree-like organization of the codes is exploited by using GRNNs. The generated features together with the graph-encodings of the ICD codes are used to classify the clinical text.\n\nSome suggestions for improvement:\n\n* It was not clear the relationship with previous work by Rios and Kavuluru. I had to refer to the paper to be able to appreciate the differences. The feature extraction network seems to be similar (Rios & Kavuluru used GCNNs instead of GRNNs to encode the ICD codes). The GAN-based feature generation seems to be new in this paper. \n\n* I did not understand the comment regarding the independent training of the zero-shot cases vs the rest.\n\n* Siblings ICD codes mean codes that share an immediate parent?\n\n* Table 1. seems to cite the related work results, but it doesn't seem to include the results of the proposed method.\n\n* In Table 2, for the cases where precision and recall are 0, are the AUC numbers correct? Table 2 also shows the results for the ablation studies that are discussed later in the section. It took me a while to understand the difference between Table 2 and Table 4.\n\n* For Table 4, you could add the explanation on what you considered few-shot cases for those results. \n\nI think the paper could improve the explanation of the components of the model and the presentation of the evaluation results.\n\nI think the idea of using GANs to generate features that can help with the classification + taking advantage of the relationship/structure among the ICD codes are both interesting ideas."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["cs2296@cornell.edu", "shanghang.zhang@petuum.com", "najmeh.sadoughi@petuum.com", "pengtao.xie@petuum.com", "eric.xing@petuum.com"], "title": "Generalized Zero-shot ICD Coding", "authors": ["Congzheng Song", "Shanghang Zhang", "Najmeh Sadoughi", "Pengtao Xie", "Eric Xing"], "pdf": "/pdf/95b983d5d8e16719bd244e26ff040ea7b34d0ae0.pdf", "TL;DR": "To solve the generalized zero-shot ICD coding problem, we propose a generative model to generate features that preserve the semantics of the zero-shot codes and exploit the hierarchy structure of the label space.", "abstract": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a list of classification codes for the diagnoses.

The main problem is that many codes have zero or very few examples. The proposed solution for this problem is to learn a feature-space generator for examples which can be conditioned on a code. This generator is trained using a GAN, which moves the few-/zero-shot problem to training the discriminator. Here, the tree structure of the ICD codes is used, by using examples with sibling labels as approximate examples for codes with few or on labelled data points. Additionally, a keyword reconstruction loss is used, based on the idea that the keywords of the corresponding ICD code can be reconstructed from a good feature vector.\n\nThe paper is written and executed well; the setup, which involves a fair number of components, is described and motivated clearly. The experiments include comparisons to state of the art results, finding that applying the GAN-based technique they choose (introduced in Xian et al., 2018 for computer vision problems) produces significant gains in recall of low-data classes (few or zero examples). The precision decreases, probably due to a shift from false negatives to false positives, while the AUC shows modest gains.\n\nThe main potential issue with the paper is the degree of (effective) novelty. The bulk of the gain relative to the SotA seems to be achievable by applying the GAN-based method, which is described in the Xian et al. (2018) reference, or by applying the label-distribution-aware margin, which are known techniques even if they have not been applied to this particular dataset yet. The additional elements introduced by the authors - the use of sibling codes and the keyword reconstruction loss - are good ideas, and it is worthwhile having a documented test of the benefit they provide, but they don\u2019t seem to have a major influence on the quality of the model.\n\nAll in all, I would argue for the paper to be accepted. The work done here is valuable to have on record, and the presentation and execution are well done.\n\nTwo questions for the authors:\n\n1. Could the model benefit from having a self-attention model, like a transformer? This applies mostly to the diagnostic text encoder, as interpreting the ICD code descriptions seems not to depend strongly on structure or context. From the text of the paper it appears that a 1D convolution was used to process the diagnostic texts, but I would expect that longer-distance links between words can be quite relevant there.\n\n2. Could the precision-recall curves be added to the supplementary material?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2571/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["cs2296@cornell.edu", "shanghang.zhang@petuum.com", "najmeh.sadoughi@petuum.com", "pengtao.xie@petuum.com", "eric.xing@petuum.com"], "title": "Generalized Zero-shot ICD Coding", "authors": ["Congzheng Song", "Shanghang Zhang", "Najmeh Sadoughi", "Pengtao Xie", "Eric Xing"], "pdf": "/pdf/95b983d5d8e16719bd244e26ff040ea7b34d0ae0.pdf", "TL;DR": "To solve the generalized zero-shot ICD coding problem, we propose a generative model to generate features that preserve the semantics of the zero-shot codes and exploit the hierarchy structure of the label space.", "abstract": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a list of classification codes for the diagnoses. Automatic ICD coding is in high demand as the manual coding can be labor-intensive and error-prone. It is a multi-label text classification task with extremely long-tailed label distribution, making it difficult to perform fine-grained classification on both frequent and zero-shot codes at the same time. In this paper, we propose a latent feature generation framework for generalized zero-shot ICD coding, where we aim to improve the prediction on codes that have no labeled data without compromising the performance on seen codes. Our framework generates pseudo features conditioned on the ICD code descriptions and exploits the ICD code hierarchical structure. To guarantee the semantic consistency between the generated features and real features, we reconstruct the keywords in the input documents that are related to the conditioned ICD codes. To the best of our knowledge, this works represents the first one that proposes an adversarial generative model for the generalized zero-shot learning on multi-label text classification.
