The layers in the OMP block are trained to be diverse and orthogonal to each other. Experiments on both white-box and black-box attacks, with or without adversarial training, have been carried out to show the efficacy of the proposed method, on the CIFAR 10 dataset.\n\n\\- I think for OMP-a and OMP-b, it is no longer considered as white-box attack when we change the direction of the parameters of one layer to another orthogonal direction, as the authors described below Fig 4.\n\n\\- Only Cifar 10 is used to verified the proposed method. Since Cifar 10 is a simpler dataset with low resolutions, it might be helpful to involve other datasets in the evaluation part.\n\n\\- There are some other defenses based on diversity ensemble, which are not discussed in the paper. For example, \"Improving Adversarial Robustness via Promoting Ensemble Diversity\".\n\n\\- From Table 2, does it mean the proposed method is not effective to improve the robustness for black-box attack compared with vanilla adversarial training?\n\nAfter reading the response, my concerns are not fully resolved.

The robustness of single network is terrible. ... adversarial examples created from one of these networks can be successfully reclassified by other networks\", I am feeling the OMP-a and OMP-b are less effective based on a real white-box attack.

Concerning your remarks:\n## 1.\u201cnot sufficient contribution as the orthogonal feature learning has been explored\u201d. \nOur work is different from orthogonal feature learning, which is to learn a group of orthogonal features and then ensemble them. Instead, we are going to train features that are adaptive to different situations, i.e., a group of orthogonal parameters (OMP block). In orthogonal feature learning, the robustness comes from ensemble strategy and then the orthogonality is to ensure the diversity. In the proposed method, the robustness comes from the adaptiveness of the networks, since it is trained considering together orthogonal paths. \n## 2.\u201cbaselines are not enough for the convincing.\u201d\nThanks for the suggestions. Accordingly, we have compared OMP with Feature Denoising [1] (Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness) and the improvement is quite significant (below are the average accuracy with 10 trials.) \n\nDue to time limitation, results of other structure and on other datasets will be reported in the final version. Besides, as answered above, our OMP is NOT an ensemble strategy. For defense performance evaluation under white-box attack, it is somehow not fair and not convenient to compare with ensemble methods (for ensembled classifier, the white-box attack should be modified.)\n\nRobustness against FGSM attack [vgg19]\n\nFGSM-$\\epsilon$ | 0 | 1/255 | 2/255 | 3/255 | 4/255 | 5/255 | 6/255 | 7/255 | 8/255 | 9/255 | 10/255 | 11/255 | 12/255\n:-: | :-:            | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:    | :-:    | :-:\n[1]    | 89.17|83.81|77.42|70.55|63.49| 56.35 | 50.15 | 44.59 | 39.47 | 35.69 | 31.88 | 28.49 | 25.37\nOMP-c |88.95|82.93|77.08|**72.79**|**69.79**| **67.74** | **66.27** | **64.83** | **63.35** |**62.12** | **60.79** | **59.63** | **58.48**\n\nRobustness against PGD attack [vgg19]\n\nPGD-$\\delta$    | 0 | 1/255 | 2/255 | 3/255 | 4/255 | 5/255 | 6/255 | 7/255 | 8/255 | 9/255 | 10/255 | 11/255 | 12/255\n :-: | :-:            | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:    | :-:    | :-:\n[1]\t   |89.17|83.65|76.47|67.50|57.48 | 47.73 | 39.08 | 32.26 | 26.23 | 21.65 | 17.88 | 15.48 | 13.43\nOMP-c |88.95|82.71|75.60|**68.20**| **63.16** | **60.07** | **57.54** | **55.90** | **54.52** | **53.51** | **52.56** | **51.72** | **51.05**\n\n##  3.\u201conly conducted on one dataset, CIFAR-10, and the attacks for evaluation are limited.\u201d \n\nThanks for the comments.

(It is not the case that we first do white-box attack on the vanilla network and then change the layer.)\n\n## 2.\u201cOnly CIFAR10\u201d. \n\nAccording to the comments, we have tested our method on **CIFAR100** data set.\n\nWe give the results of vgg16/19 trained on **CIFAR100**.\n\nThe step size of FGSM and bound of PGD are both $8/255$.\n\nFor CIFAR100, we set the number of paths in OMPc as 40.\n\n- vanilla training\n\nmodel | clean | FGSM\n:-:         | :-:       | :-:\nvgg16  | 72.45 | 16.09\nOMP-c | **73.05** | **22.24**\n----------|---------|-------------\nvgg19  | 69.90 | 16.07\nOMP-c | **71.76** | **30.13**\n\n- adversarial training\n\nmodel | clean | FGSM | PGD\n:-:         | :-:       | :-:        | :-:\nvgg16  | 62.62 | 22.80  | 13.90\nOMP-c | **62.87** | **25.86** | **15.90**\n----------|---------|---------|---------\nvgg19  | 60.90 | 19.93 | 11.25\nOMP-c | **62.08** | **33.13** | **24.27**\n\nFor models trained on CIFAR100, OMP-c could still enhance robustness.\n\n## 3.\u201cdefenses based on diversity ensemble\u201d. \n\nAs answered to your 1st question, only one path is chosen after training and hence OMP is not an ensemble strategy. Actually, for ensemble methods, the white-box attack is not convenient to impose (simply imposing is not white-box attack) and hence will be unfair (also considering about the model size and inference time).\n\n## 4.\u201cthe results on Table 2\u201d. \n\nIn Table 2, when the source model and the target model are of the same structure, OMP model is much more effective than vanilla training model in defending black-box attacks. Meanwhile, in other cases, such as where adversarial training is included, and where the source model and the target model are not of the same structure, OMP model indeed only shows slightly better or similar performance compared with vanilla adversarial training model and is expected to be further improved. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper407/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper407/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learn Robust Features via Orthogonal Multi-Path", "authorids": ["~Kun_Fang1", "~Xiaolin_Huang1", "~Yingwen_Wu1", "~Tao_Li12", "jieyang@sjtu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Kun Fang", "Xiaolin Huang", "Yingwen Wu", "Tao Li", "Jie Yang"], "keywords": ["adversarial robustness", "orthogonal multi-path"], "abstract": "\tIt is now widely known that by adversarial attacks, clean images with invisible perturbations can fool deep neural networks.\n\tTo defend adversarial attacks, we design a block containing multiple paths to learn robust features and the parameters of these paths are  required to be orthogonal with each other. \n\tThe so-called Orthogonal Multi-Path (OMP) block could be posed in any layer of a neural network. \n\tVia forward learning and backward correction, one OMP block makes the neural networks learn features that are appropriate for all the paths and hence are expected to be robust.

Concerning your remarks:\n## 1.\"Some of those papers should be cited\"\nThanks for the provided relevant papers [1,2]. These papers provide some theoretical insights about the orthogonality constraint. We will add citations to these papers in the revised version. The proposed OMP model is to enhance the adaptiveness of the neural networks to different paths. To guarantee the differences, we require the parameters of the paths are orthogonal by adding a, we admit, very simple constraint. We agree with you that they are only near-orthogonal. But it already achieves our aim. But of course, we expect that with other ingenious design on the orthogonality, the performance could be further improved in the future study.\n\n## 2.\u201cCompared with regularization-based defense\u201d. \n\nThe orthogonal constraint is not added in the training target as a regularization term. Instead, it is used to guarantee the difference of the paths, and then to correct the features learned by front layers, resulting in more robust features. \n\nTherefore, the proposed OMP model is not a typically regularization-based defense. Generally, regularization-based defenses have accuracy loss in clean examples but the proposed OMP could keep the performance. Indeed, from the view of model capacity controlling, OMP could be viewed as regularization and so are the compared algorithms, namely RSE [3], PNI [4] and advBNN [5].\n\n## 3.\u201cdiscussions on different improvements between VGG and ResNet\u201d. \n\nIndeed, this is an interesting point and deserves discussion. VGG consists of several cascaded convolutional layers, while ResNet owns the unique residual connection structure. Perhaps residual connection structure is helpful for learning more robust features, which results in not-so-significant improvements on Resnet. However, this guess is quite heuristic and thus we did not include in the manuscript. \n\n## 4. \u201cearly stopping\u201d. \nThanks for providing the reference about early stopping. In our OMP training, we do not use early stopping trick, and just stop training the network after a fixed number of epochs. In detail, for vgg, we train the networks on the training set for 200 epochs. For Resnet, the number of training epochs is 350. We will add this setting in the appendix and will discuss early stopping in the future. \n\n## 5.\u201cdifferent inference schemes\u201d. \n\nThis is an interesting suggestion. Currently we do not use any ensemble strategy and report the performance of each individual network w.r.t. each path. We will test the performance of more inference schemes later.\n\n## \n\n[1] Bansal et al. 2018. Can we gain more from orthogonality regularizations in training deep cnns?;\n\n[2] Huang et al. 2020.

Results show some improvements over regular adversarial training. Interestingly, the improvements are very significant on the VGG networks, while not quite significant for the ResNet variants tested.\n\nThis paper claimed that it creates orthogonal paths, but it's realistically near-orthogonal since they only added a soft constraint on the OMP regularization term, similar algorithms have been proposed in the past:\n\n[Bansal et al. 2018] Can we gain more from orthogonality regularizations in training deep cnns?\n\nThere have also been quite a few work on learning real orthogonal paths based on Riemannian manifold optimization. Some of these are of similar speed as conventional SGD and Adam.

NeuRIPS 2019.\n\nComparisons against those algorithms would further verify the performance of the proposed approach.\n\nBesides, there should be some discussions on potentially why the improvements on VGG networks are very significant and not so much on ResNet.\n\nThere is also some recent evidence on the effect of early stopping on adversarial defenses (e.g. Rice et al. Overfitting in adversarially robust deep learning. ICML 2020). It would be nice if the authors could state when did they stop the training of the respective models.\n\nIn terms of ablation, it would be nice to see different inference schemes. e.g. whether using a subset of the paths in the OMP block would be beneficial against adversarial examples or not.\n\nI look forward to seeing the authors rebuttal and comments from other reviewers.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper407/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper407/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learn Robust Features via Orthogonal Multi-Path", "authorids": ["~Kun_Fang1", "~Xiaolin_Huang1", "~Yingwen_Wu1", "~Tao_Li12", "jieyang@sjtu.edu.cn"], "authors": ["Kun Fang", "Xiaolin Huang", "Yingwen Wu", "Tao Li", "Jie Yang"], "keywords": ["adversarial robustness", "orthogonal multi-path"], "abstract": "\tIt is now widely known that by adversarial attacks, clean images with invisible perturbations can fool deep neural networks.\n\tTo defend adversarial attacks, we design a block containing multiple paths to learn robust features and the parameters of these paths are  required to be orthogonal with each other. \n\tThe so-called Orthogonal Multi-Path (OMP) block could be posed in any layer of a neural network. \n\tVia forward learning and backward correction, one OMP block makes the neural networks learn features that are appropriate for all the paths and hence are expected to be robust.
