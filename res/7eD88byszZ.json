It claims the existence of nearly linear sized sparsifiers under this notion, and suggests empirical methods to produce such sparsifiers in nearly linear time.\n\nComments\n=========\n\nSection 4: I am not sure what is the downstream justification for the notion of spectral approximation studied here (relative condition number) in the context of directed graphs, and it would help if the authors could elaborate on this. For example, the\u00a0notion defined in Cohen et al. (2017) enables fast approximate solution of linear equations, which is a primitive in various algorithmic tasks on directed graphs. The notion in this paper does not rigorously lead to such consequences (or at least none are presented), which leaves the question why one should\u00a0be interested in an existence result like Theorem 4.3. (The appendix contains some experimental results for linear system solving, but no rigorous claims.)\n\nAbout the proof Theorem 4.3: Could you please clarify how does the approximating matrix $L_{S_u} = B^T W_o^{1/2} T\u00a0W_o^{1/2} B$ (defined in the end of section 8.2) give rise to a directed subgraph? How does one construct $S$ (or in other words, why can $L_{S_u}$ be written as $L_SL_S^T$ for $L_S$ of the form in eq (18))\n\nSection 5: I am generally not able to follow the derivations in section 5.2, and it may be needed to be written more clearly. Specific comments/questions:\n1. How come $\\lambda_n>0$ if the matrix $L_{S_u}^+L_{G_u}$\u00a0 has non-full rank?\n2. You define v_i once as the eigenvectors of $L_{S_u}^+L_{G_u}$ in the first sentence sentence as then as scaled eigenvalues of $L_{S_u}$ between eq (5) and (6), which one is it? Or are they supposed to be denoted differently?\n3. Could you elaborate on how you arrive at eq (5)?\n\nSection 6: The experiments in the main text concentrate on measuring the relative condition number of the sparsifier w.r.t the original graph as per the sparsification notion studied in this paper, but as written above it is not clear what do we actually get out of the sparsifier. In general I have doubts about fit to the venue; while ICLR scope is broad and inclusive and spectral sparsification has certain potential connections to ML, this paper does not highlight any of them, and it is not entirely clear what it is attempting to achieve.\n\nConclusion:\n=========\nPros: Spectral sparsification of directed graphs is a relatively\u00a0new field, so far with initial results that invite further\u00a0research and improvements. The paper implements an algorithm which seems to improve over baselines under certain metrics.\nCons: It is not clear what ML task the paper is trying to solve or improve upon, and what improvement is achieved. Viewed as a theoretical submission, the analysis is unclear to me in many parts, and at present I am unable to confirm its soundness. The algorithm implemented in the experimental section seems rather detached from the preceding theoretical definitions, whose purpose remains somewhat unclear.\u00a0\n\nPost-discussion update: I thank the authors for their participation in the discussion. Unfortunately I find it mostly has not cleared the numerous question marks I have regarding the paper. I recommend putting more effort into clarifying the mathematical derivations and into positioning the paper correctly w.r.t. prior work on the topic.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2410/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2410/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Unified Spectral Sparsification Framework for Directed Graphs", "authorids": ["yzhan232@stevens.edu", "~Zhiqiang_Zhao1", "~Zhuo_Feng3"], "authors": ["ying zhang", "Zhiqiang Zhao", "Zhuo Feng"], "keywords": ["Spectral Graph Theory", "Spectral Sparsification", "Directed Graphs", "Laplacian Solver", "PageRank Vectors"], "abstract": "Recent spectral graph sparsification research allows constructing nearly-linear-sized subgraphs that can well preserve the spectral (structural) properties of the original graph, such as the first few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, leading to the development of a variety of nearly-linear time numerical and graph algorithms.

They prove that their definition formally leads to fast approximate solutions to graphic linear systems, which is a subroutine in numerous applications. Does your definition also give rise to this kind of formal result? Or is the connection to the experimental tasks only heuristic?\n\n---Our response: as described on page 4 (Section 3.2) of our paper, for directed graphs our method will extract a subgraph $S$ such that the condition number of $L_S^+L_G$ will approach 1, or equivalently, both the max/min singular values of $L_S^+L_G$ will approach 1. This property also implies very similar spectral properties between the subgraph $S$ and the original graph $G$. A small condition number (close to 1) allows iterative methods, such as the GMRES algorithm, to converge very quickly, which leads to the development of fast Laplacian solvers for directed graphs. So, all our experimental results are clearly connected with our theory.\n\n\nI still do not see how one extracts a directed subgraph from the matrix \n defined in the end of the proof of Theorem 7.2. It satisfies eq. (24) as a matrix, but why is it a sparsifier?\n\n---Our response: as shown in Section 4.2 in the revised draft, we formulate the spectral sparsification task as a min-max optimization problem in (8). After converting the directed graphs ($S$ and $G$) into undirected ones ($S_u$ and $G_u$) using the proposed spectrum-preserving Laplacian symmetrization process, in our approach the following two steps will be performed iteratively such that the maximum mismatch (that is bounded by the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$) between graphs $S_u$ and $G_u$ will be minimized: (Step A) we first find out the boundary (or the node set) that has the greatest cut mismatch between  ${S_u}$ and ${G_u}$ based on spectral edge embedding with the dominant generalized eigenvector, as described in equations (5) to (7); (Step B) Next, we add a few edges (in $G$) to the subgraph (S) so that the largest cut mismatch (the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$) between $S_u$ and $G_u$ can be drastically reduced, as described in equation (8). By repeatedly applying the above two-step procedure, the largest eigenvalue ($\\lambda_1$) will become very small, implying very small mismatches between the subgraph $S$ and the original graph $G$.

For example, the notion defined in Cohen et al. (2017) enables fast approximate solution of linear equations, which is a primitive in various algorithmic tasks on directed graphs. The notion in this paper does not rigorously lead to such consequences (or at least none are presented), which leaves the question why one should be interested in an existence result like Theorem 4.3. (The appendix contains some experimental results for linear system solving, but no rigorous claims.)\nAbout the proof Theorem 4.3: Could you please clarify how does the approximating matrix  (defined in the end of section 8.2) give rise to a directed subgraph? How does one construct  (or in other words, why can  be written as  for  of the form in eq (18))\"\n\n----Our response: Thanks a lot for the feedback. We have included more information in the latest paper to show more detailed procedures for the construction of directed sparsifiers. A more detailed proof of our theorem is also provided.  \n\n\"Section 5: I am generally not able to follow the derivations in section 5.2, and it may be needed to be written more clearly. Specific comments/questions:\nHow come  if the matrix   has non-full rank?\"\n\n----Our response: The directed or undirected Laplacians are all non-full rank matrices. When solving the generalized eigenvalue problems in section 5.3, we add a very small value into the diagonal of L_{S_u} to make L_{S_u} a full-rank matrix, which is equivalent to introducing a rather weak self-loop to each node. Such a modification will not impact the global structure of the graph, and thus allows the proposed sparsification to be effectively performed.\n\n\"You define v_i once as the eigenvectors of in the first sentence as then as scaled eigenvalues of between eq (5) and (6), which one is it? Or are they supposed to be denoted differently?\neq (5) is derived from eq(4), and eq (6) represents that generalized eigenvectors  v_i are L_{s_u} orthogonal to each other, which is one of the properties for the generalized eigenvalue problems.  So v_i are not scaled during the whole procedure. \nCould you elaborate on how you arrive at eq (5)?\"\n\n----Our response: The detailed derivation of eq (5) has been updated in the latest paper. Hopefully, this will help address your concerns. \n\n\"Section 6: The experiments in the main text concentrate on measuring the relative condition number of the sparsifier w.r.t the original graph as per the sparsification notion studied in this paper, but as written above it is not clear what do we actually get out of the sparsifier. In general I have doubts about fit to the venue; while ICLR scope is broad and inclusive and spectral sparsification has certain potential connections to ML, this paper does not highlight any of them, and it is not entirely clear what it is attempting to achieve.\"\n \n----Our response: This work introduces the first unified framework for general spectral graph sparsification tasks. We show comprehensive applications of spectral sparsifiers of directed graphs: for example directed Laplacian solver can be used for computing the stationary distributions of Markov chains; directed graph partitioning and clustering are very important applications related to machine learning and data mining; PageRank and personalized PageRank play important roles in modeling and analysis of large-scale real-world networks.

The core algorithm and most important numerical results have been moved to the main paper.\n\n\"The comparison for the linear solver application should also include the special case of undirected graphs. How does your sparsifier compare then with Spielman et.al. methods? Also, for the general case of directed graphs which are not strongly connected, you should compare with existing sparsifiers for directed graphs but whose analysis requires them to be strongly connected. Maybe in practice, those existing sparsifiers work fine.\"\n\n----Our response: Thanks for the suggestions. We have compared with another undirected graph sparsification tool GRASS, showing that ignoring edge directivities will lead to much worse results. We also tried to use Spielman's implementation that is available at https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl. However, the program requires a rather nontrivial tuning of the input parameters for sampling edges using effective resistance, which is also dataset dependent. As a result, for many occasions, it failed to produce a desirable sparsity in the output graph. We expect this tool if optimally tuned, would produce a similar result as GRASS which we have used in our current comparisons.\n\n\"Pls also evaluate the sparsifier on machine learning applications, e.g., federated and multi-task learning over networks:\nA.

Tran, \"Localized Linear Regression in Networked Data,\" in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 26, no. 7, pp. 1090-1094, July 2019, DOI: 10.1109/LSP.2019.2918933.\"\n\n----Our response: Thanks for the suggestions. The suggested work targets a quite different research task that aims to solve the network Lasso (nLasso) problem involving only undirected graphs. It is not very clear to us if the properties preserved by spectral sparsification can directly benefit such applications, and more importantly, result in a substantial improvement of the solution. We believe it will be valuable for us to spend more time studying the suggested problems in the future.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2410/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2410/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Unified Spectral Sparsification Framework for Directed Graphs", "authorids": ["yzhan232@stevens.edu", "~Zhiqiang_Zhao1", "~Zhuo_Feng3"], "authors": ["ying zhang", "Zhiqiang Zhao", "Zhuo Feng"], "keywords": ["Spectral Graph Theory", "Spectral Sparsification", "Directed Graphs", "Laplacian Solver", "PageRank Vectors"], "abstract": "Recent spectral graph sparsification research allows constructing nearly-linear-sized subgraphs that can well preserve the spectral (structural) properties of the original graph, such as the first few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, leading to the development of a variety of nearly-linear time numerical and graph algorithms.

We show that as long as we can find a sparse subgraph such that its Laplacian has a small Riemannian Distance from the original Laplacian, the two graphs will have similar graph spectral properties. To this end, we introduce a min-max optimization formulation (8) for tackling the Riemannian distance minimization problems. Next, a spectral perturbation framework is introduced to allow efficiently solving the above min-max optimization problem. We also provide more detailed procedures for the proof of Theorem 7.1.

The main contribution is the proposal of a unified approach for spectral sparsification of such directed graphs.\n\nThe proposed eigenvalue perturbation pipeline is interesting in its own right, and similarly that of ranking edges in terms of spectral importance from Section 5.2.  One of the main advantages of the approach is that it does not require the underlying directed graphs to be strongly connected and aperiodic, unlike recent work from the literature. Their proposed approach is fairly straightforward, but yet appears to be very efficient. The authors do a good job of placing their work in the relevant context, highlighting drawbacks of existing symmetrization techniques. The authors rightfully point out that naive symmetrization schemes from the literature may damage the structural properties of the graph. The proposed a Laplacian symmetrization approach which enjoys theoretical guarantees while remaining computationally scalable. The authors also mention other properties of interest that one could preserve during the sparsification process. \n\nThe authors also evaluate the embedding given by the proposed symmetrized Laplacian in the context of clustering directed graphs, where the majority of existing spectral methods tend to underperform. Clustering directed graphs is an important timely problem, less studied, and the present work makes also a nice contribution in that regard. The application to computing the (Personalized) PageRank is also nice (the sparsification appears to perform well in the PageRank computation), but perhaps less impactful since since this can be computed fast via a number of other methods. \n\nThe authors could further provide more intuition linking Theorem 4.3 on the existence of the sparsifier, and Section 5, in particular the pipeline in Section 5.2  The authors could also consider testing on synthetic data sets, also to assess the behaviour of the proposed method on graphs with increasing density. What about comparison with other approaches?
