We welcome other views on what are the first skills to focus on in the development of general AI, and we hope our position paper, if published, will stir further discussion of this kind.\n\nOur reason to focus on language is two-fold. First, we find it hard to conceive that an AI could be useful to human beings if we were not able to communicate with it (to give it instructions and teach it new skills). Language is by far the easiest and most powerful communication tool that humans can use. Second, while our tasks are superficially linguistic in nature, for a system to learn how to handle them from scratch would require very powerful learning to learn capabilities (discovering that certain recurrent sequences are meaningful and thus they should be memorized even in the absence of specific reward, the ability to combine skills learned in simpler tasks in order to address more advanced tasks, the ability to find systematic correspondences between signs--the regexps--and their denotation--the strings, etc.). The minimal setup we are considering should allow researchers to focus on such challenges, rather than on large-scale/noisy data processing issues.\n\nWe are definitely not claiming that a system trained on the specific set of CommAI-mini tasks would then be ready to go out in the world and tackle all sorts of advanced tasks, but we realistically think that a learner that was able to solve these tasks without any ad-hoc hand-coded knowledge would be so general that it should be possible to train it, e.g., to have more general conversations with humans. Next, the conversational and linguistic skills could be exploited to teach the machine about the domains of interest (e.g., by instructing the machine to study the Wikipedia), and so on and so forth. We recognize, of course, that we are not there, yet, but we believe that this is an avenue that is worth exploring.\n\nGoodAI recently announced a challenge based on our CommAI-mini tasks. We will thus soon be able to ascertain whether there are systems that can solve them, and whether such systems can then scale up to tasks in other domains.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI", "abstract": "With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal.

This ultimately pushes us to develop more general learning algorithms that indeed need to \"learn to learn\" or learn to adapt to different, but related tasks. I think that's something that has been more and more important. \n\nCons:\nThe major problem I have with paper and framework, stems not necessarily from the tasks themselves, but from the identified desiderata. It seems to be <<very>> natural language/text focused. This is an on-going debate whether or not that is a crucial component in the development of general AI and how we will interact with AI. It seems to me, that most of the effort -- at least computationally -- would be spent modelling the particular structure present in text-like inputs/data and that automatically shifts the focus away from what we should be doing, or what the AIs should be trying to figure out which is more complex tasks, more planning and optimization challenging scenarios.\nWhich brings me to the second point. Say you believe in the desiderata outline, the tasks seem to match what was highlighted in the agenda, but the level of complexity it's relatively low. That's not to say that these are simple tasks for our learning algorithms to pick up, just the complexity doesn't lie in the task per se, but trying to model the language/syntax. I fail to see what succeeding on these tasks, say, in general, about now taking this system and applying it to optimizing energy consumption, or recognizing emotions, or even something domain-related like dialogue systems.\n\nTo sum: I think the paper addresses a very real problem and, as I said previously, I don't think we don't have the/a right answer or even a satisfactory answer at this point in time. I do think though the framework proposed is too limited in scope to claim generality. That being said, it might still be 'useful' -- if you agree with the proposed desiderata, it seems like a sensible set of tasks to try out.  \n\n \n  ", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI", "abstract": "With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal.

Consider that in our setup the learner is only getting one bit at a time, and thus simply discovering that there are recurrent, re-usable patterns of 8-bit sequences that are playing a meaningful role in the definition of the tasks is a big challenge for it. Moreover, the algorithm cannot learn the regexps by example, as it will be exposed to each regexp only once. What the learner needs to do, after it has discovered how to parse the environment strings into their component parts (regexp, order, target string...), is to learn a general way to \"compile\" the regular expression in order to analyze the string at hand (or to produce one or multiple strings). This is an enormously more difficult task than generalizing a stringset based on a number of examples. All this, with no explicit task segmentation, and very sparse reward, as the learner is only getting reward when it produces the right solution for a task. Note also that, unlike in the Weston paper, our learner is free to generate any sequence of bits (with thus a huge space to explore), rather than having to pick a fixed answer from a list.\n\nCompositionality should play a crucial role in the solution. In order to solve what is essentially a continuous stream of 0-shot tasks, the learner must learn to re-use components such as the ability to parse bits into bytes, the ability to parse the instructions into parts, the ability to process and apply regular expressions, and the ability to parse an increasingly richer regexp syntax. Similar abilities would doubtlessly also be learned by, say, natural language parsing, in a setup in which the learner is provided no supervision about what it needs to do in order to get reward, but that would be even more complex.\n\nWe are currently experimenting with a set of tasks that are much simpler than the ones presented in the position abstract, using a RNN trained with RL. We are finding that this approach does not go anywhere even in the simplified scenario. We are however not reporting such results in the paper since it's hard to definitely prove a negative result.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI", "abstract": "With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal.

The proposal consists of two pieces:\n\n- high-level desiderata for a general AI: namely, the ability to efficiently learn multiple tasks with shared structure from natural language guidance provided as a generic bit stream.\n\n- a concrete task for investigating these desiderata: namely, membership and sampling queries for regular languages specified by regular expressions.\n\nI'm honestly not sure what to make of this paper. It's very much in the same spirit as the earlier bAbI tasks, which, while well-intentioned, I think have done active harm to the AI research community by making it socially acceptable to develop methods for toy problems without ever verifying that they actually scale-up to real-world tasks. To use the dichotomy the authors introduce in section 3, the problem is that essentially all meaningful progress in the field has come from \"bottom-up\" approaches: \"top-down\" approaches have a poor track record of scaling up, while the set of challenging reasoning problems solved by \"bottom-up\" approaches continues to grow.\n\nOn the other hand, I recognize that mine may no longer be a mainstream position, and that in any case it's unfair to downgrade a position paper because I disagree with the position. It's probably healthy for the community to have this discussion, and the ICLR crowd perhaps needs it most of all.\n\nBut I do think the position could be better defended. In particular: we already know that:\n\n1. It's easy for RNNs to sample from and query regular languages (learned by example---I don't actually know of work on starting from symbolic REs as done here)\n\n2. It's certainly possible to learn from this mixed RL / text-based supervision condition (e.g. Weston 2016).\n\nThese two things together make up the whole task. So it's not obvious that we can't solve it by throwing generic RNN machinery at it, and the burden is on the authors of a new task to show that it can't already be solved using state-of-the-art methods. The paper's claim that \"We hope the CommAI-mini challenge is at the right level of complexity to stimulate researchers to develop genuinely new models\" would be much stronger if it already demonstrated that genuinely new models are required; right now that demonstration is missing.\n\nNow suppose we do solve this task (with whatever model). What have we learned? Just that it's possible to quickly learn how to work with regular languages? What notion of compositionality is present in this task and not, e.g. natural language parsing? What have we learned about \"learning to learn\" that's different from learning good gradient descent algorithms, initializers, RL with natural language instructions, etc.?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI", "abstract": "With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost every day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal.

", "comment": "Dear Marco, Thank you for your note.\n\nI am struck by your reply of an \u2018intuitive notion of useful AI\u2019, as intuition must precede firm models. Still, can you offer more detail on that intuition? I reread the material and I am left mostly with (I paraphrase) \u2018learning the use of language is important\u2019. I ask for more detail as I wonder how precise, well-formed, or extensible that intuition is \u2013 my own interpretation here feels a bit superficial.\n\nAn intriguing part of the CommAI environment is that it may target what I call a \u2018universal grammar\u2019 for machine learning. This, by itself, is interesting. Similarly, Shannon\u2019s signal entropy gave objective structure our sense of \u2018information\u2019, and still underlies many modern advances. But this also led to \u2018bizarre and unsatisfying\u2019 (Shannon & Weaver, 1949) views of information. It would be sad to see \u2018bizarre and unsatisfying\u2019 aspects perpetuated \u2013 with that mistake now made for \u2018intelligence\u2019, as occurred with \u2018information\u2019.\n\nFor example, the CommAI environment is essentially semiotic, focusing on syntactical tasks but excluding semantic aspects (the *functional value* one might ascribe to a banana versus an apple, or to bananas and apples of different types). The later would need to be included if one wishes to call the system truly intelligent, no? I assume we both target a *true* general intelligence, so this seems like a critical matter. Do you have thoughts on treating syntactic/semantic differences?\n\nOther parts of the proposal I find similarly bothersome . . . \n\u2018. . . important to instruct the machine in new domains\u2019 (sec 1). \nWhy is the system (ultimately) not set to posit, reveal, or articulate new domains, in an intelligent manner. For example, in a backward looking way, we might ask \u2018How might a wheel be invented, from a set of previously existing elements?\u2019 The developmental steps involved could then be mapped, as a bottoms-up model. Discrete domain mapping (top down) is needed, but at the risk of leaving explanatory gaps between domains? Enough 'local domains' may eventually be mapped that a synthesizing (general) view can be attempted, but at some far distant point. Bottoms-up modeling \u2018forces the gap issue\u2019 by requiring first principles (where possible) that close said gaps. \n\nAlso (perhaps trivial?), a \u2018. . . common bit-level interface\u2019 is variously referenced in the material, which puzzles me. A bit-to-bit role seems to imply something coded in machine language, rather than programs that pass through a conversion (compiling) process. The later is innately indirect. Even in processor design, subtle bit-to-bit differences are known to exist across architectures that affect processor outputs. This leads me to wonder if you mean something specific (or figurative) in pointing to bit-to-bit relationships?\n\nLastly, I see the proposal as circumspect in any claims on what is possible with a CommAI environment, so I do not wish to force a defensive position. I merely hope to better grasp the group\u2019s thinking on this challenging topic. Thank you, in advance, for your reply.\n\nShannon, C., & Weaver, W. (1949).

The gist of my note asserts your worthy project is not sufficient to describe or explain \u2018general intelligence\u2019. For example, a criticism is that I see no balanced consideration of bottoms-up facets. A purely *top-down* CommAI seems not only essentially anthropocentric, but also largely symbol based (semiotic), Anglocentric, and narrowly denotative (versus connotative). Each *qualifier* lessens the range of what might be seen as \u2018general\u2019 \u2013 which, you may then agree, is general only in a very narrow sense(?).\n\nThis leaves me wondering about \u2018requirements derived from psychological or mathematical (or even \u2018simple physics tasks\u2019 [sec 2]) considerations\u2019. This seems like a large leap from foundational traits (physics, etc.) to more semiotic roles (CommAI environment), entailing many unexamined assumptions/details. I see your effort to address some that innate ambiguity in the appendix, but it (again) seems largely semiotic in nature, and is thus unsatisfying. The key issue I see here lies in how narrowly or widely defined the \u2018environment\u2019 is, within which proposals are tested. For example, game environments are too narrow to compare with \u2018general uncontrolled variables\u2019 that typify much of our daily environs. Yes, practical limits are needed as a starting point (a bounded rationale), but is the essentially semiotic view you offer the best starting point?\n\nAlternatively, I advocate for a functionalist foundation (true bottoms-up) as a needed complement, or even a precursor, to framing a true general intelligence. As I understand ICLR is not the correct venue for exploring general intelligence, I would appreciate thoughts you may wish to share (e.g., re appropriate venues) on this matter, and/or on the bottoms-up proposal offered in \u2018A Priori Modeling of Information and Intelligence\u2019.
