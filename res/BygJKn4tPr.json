The proposed data analytical approach differentiates itself from the other similar approaches that were focused only on the descriptive analysis rather than going for a bigger context with predictive modelling and formation pairs mining that would assist in modifying existing rules to tackle injury concerns. The predictive model that works with Kafka-stream processor real-time inputs and risky formation pairs identification by designing FP-Matrix, makes this far-reaching solution to analyse injury data on various grounds wherever applicable.", "authorids": ["anzanfas@gmail.com", "arulanantham.arraamuthan@my.sliit.lk", "it16113800@my.sliit.lk", "krusanth7@gmail.com", "prasanna@sliit.lk"], "keywords": ["Concussion", "American football", "Predictive modelling", "Injuries", "NFL Plays", "Optimization"], "TL;DR": "Mitigate concussions in American Football using Machine learning and Optimization techniques", "pdf": "/pdf/efe733c5d12d8372e01311ee567c3e3d8058c167.pdf", "paperhash": "arulanantham|effective_mechanism_to_mitigate_injuries_during_nfl_plays", "original_pdf": "/attachment/efe733c5d12d8372e01311ee567c3e3d8058c167.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\narulanantham2020effective,\ntitle={Effective Mechanism to Mitigate Injuries During {\\{}NFL{\\}} Plays },\nauthor={Arraamuthan Arulanantham and Ahamed Arshad Ahamed Anzar and Gowshalini Rajalingam and Krusanth Ingran and Prasanna S.
