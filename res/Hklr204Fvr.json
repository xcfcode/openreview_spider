It is insightful and will help us improve our discussion.", "comment": "Relation to MRF\u2019s and CRF\u2019s:\nProbabilistic graphical models are a great approach for capturing known structure in data. We believe our approach is complementary and distinct from the probabilistic approaches. Specifically, the relationship between FGL and MRF/CRF is analogous to the relationship between RNN/LSTM/GRU and HMM\u2019s. Both approaches tackle a similar task. One focuses on a deep neural network for structured representation learning, while the other focuses on direct probabilistic modeling. One advantage of the FGL deep representation learning is fast inference as compared to MRF/CRF, perhaps at the cost of diminished interpretability. On the other hand, probabilistic models clearly capture detailed semantics but can pose the challenge of efficient inference. As mentioned, these methods can be closely related. Constructing a probabilistic method that is equivalent to FGL (such as the RNN<->CRF equivalence you have pointed out) is an interesting question that is left for future work. \n\nAdditional discussions on tradeoffs of FGL for structured smoothness (re: early vs. late)\n1. Computational feasibility: An important point to notice is the dimensionality of the problem. fMRI images are 3D (200k \u201cpixels\u201d in our case), while standard images are 2D - hence, of much lower dimensionality. Thus, to use a neural network (and remain computationally feasible) some form of pooling is required in the forward pass. \n\n2. Results on downsampled images: As an early experiment, we attempted the same task on 2x downsampled images and saw a ~10% drop in accuracy (for FGL and worse for other models). This implies that there is value in doing this segmentation earlier rather than later.\n\nEffects of selecting A: \n1. Imperfect A (simulated experiments): To clarify how our results depend on the quality of the A matrix, we constructed an experiment to measure the sensitivity of  FGL is to A in simulated conditions. Here, we generated approximate A by using MiniBatchKMeans using 16, 32 and 48 clusters -- and everything else matching our simulated results (Section 3.2). The resulting accuracy was 61.3%, 66.1%, and 66.3%. Recall, that the ground truth A, with 32 regions/clusters, has 70.2% accuracy. This drop in accuracy still outperforms CNNs and CoordConv (56% accuracy) and FNNs (43% accuracy). The additional drop in accuracy at 16 clusters is expected since we\u2019re trying to represent what happens in 32 regions by just 16 regions. These results have been added to the supplement.\n\n2. Imperfect A (in fMRI): Indeed, it is true that our method can be affected by the quality of A. We chose ward clustering, itself known to be an approximation, as it is considered one of the best methods for data-driven clustering of fMRI (Thirion et.al., 2014). Our experiments show that it can be very effective. Our simulated results suggest that future improvements to fMRI clustering will most likely serve to improve our results further.\nTaken together, these results suggest that FGL with an inaccurate A will still outperform standard approaches (in all our experiments, both real and simulated) \n\nYour idea of learning a good clustering directly for the supervised task is also an interesting one. Ideally, one can do this using a semi-supervised approach that takes advantage of the wealth of unsupervised data (as is common for fMRI and other biological datasets). We plan to explore this further in future work.\n\nHow to find a good A: \nThe grouping that should be used in each problem depends on the domain - in the case of fMRI imaging, there is previous work that shows that Ward clustering produces a good grouping, and indeed, it does outperform random groupings (like the ones that Aydore used). Below are some ideas on other domains where we believe FGL can be applied.\n\n1. Biological images: As mentioned in the manuscript, biological images are often aligned as a standard preprocessing step. Further, anatomical constraints ensure that the coarse structure of the image is similar across samples.  Examples include x-ray images of the lung and CT images of knees, among others. The task of interest is often to automate diagnosis. Extending this work to a broad range of biological problems is an active research interest for us, with very promising preliminary results.\n\n2. Financial predictions from stock market price data: Stock prices are correlated with each other in interesting ways (across countries, industries, etc). The correlation matrix could be used as A. Reasonable choices include known correlations (e.g., based on country, industry) or estimated correlations (i.e., unsupervised from data).\n\n3. Face Identification: Consider the problem of face identification with aligned photos (e.g. mugshots). Here, the alignment of the photos also suggests that informative structure, e.g., the location of the forehead, nose, etc., is shared across images, thus associated pixels may be represented as a \u201cgroup\u201d.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1355/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1355/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["haroun7@gmail.com", "sanmi@illinois.edu"], "title": "Towards a Deep Network Architecture for Structured Smoothness", "authors": ["Haroun Habeeb", "Oluwasanmi Koyejo"], "pdf": "/pdf/b0a6d2852b635cf332dadbf93708996b82f14b36.pdf", "TL;DR": "A feedforward layer to incorporate structured smoothness into a deep learning model", "abstract": "We propose the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL); a novel feedforward layer designed to incorporate the inductive bias of structured smoothness into a deep learning model.

Unlike convolutional layers, the fixed grouping layer only allows the output to be impacted by the specific inputs associated to it by its group. The paper stays firmly in the area of brain scans with the authors hoping to generalize to other applications later. Their experiments compare to what they consider to be the state-of-the-art approaches to the problem. \n\nI did find Figure S2A helpful to quickly understand some of the simulated data approach, maybe it should be in the paper and not supplementary. \n\nI argue for accepting this paper because the experiments, while focused solely in one discipline, are thorough. I would have liked clearer description of other areas that might benefit in the last sentence.
