We would like to address your concerns as follows:\n\n1. Comparison to Previous Works\n\nThey and we are addressing a common issue, label consistency in domain-invariant representations, hence the seeming similarities. But all take a different perspective to focus on.\nIn [1], they propose a lower bound on the target error. Again, they do not explicitly consider the embedding complexity. We point out that restricting the encoder is a necessary condition to achieve good performance in unsupervised domain adaptation.\nIn [2], they provide an upper bound by leveraging the \u201cconnectedness\u201d in input space and the Lipschitzness of the encoder. However, the input space distance between source and target domains has to be small to make the bound tighter, which might not hold in the common domain adaptation benchmarks (e.g. MNIST->MNIST-M).\n\nIn comparison, the embedding complexity is not discussed in [1,2] and we believe that the insights from our theory and experiments are unique. With respect to the example, in contrast to [1-2], our example is motivated by the \u201cembedding complexity\u201d (main difference). For instance, in Figure 1, we compare two encoders with different complexity which is not shown in previous works.\n\n\n2. About the upper bound\n\nIn most of the domain adaptation bounds (including [1,2,3]), the goal is to use the source error to bound the target error. Therefore, without assuming the source error is small, not only our bound, the bounds in [1,2,3] are also large since the first term of the bound is the source error itself. As a consequence, assuming the additional two terms R_S(f^{\\prime}g) are small is reasonable. Also, in most of the papers [1,2,3], the proposed bound can neither be computed or approximated. \n\nComparing to [3], our bound is tighter if the source error and the latent divergence is sufficiently minimized. As we point out in Definition 3, the FG\\DeltaG-divergence is smaller than the FG\\DeltaFG-divergence. Therefore, comparing to (4) (the bound of [3]), if the lambda in (4) and (6) are small enough and the latent divergence is sufficiently minimized in (6), our bound (6) is smaller than the original bound (4) in [3] . \n\n\n3. Layer-wise Tradeoff\n\nIn [4, section 6.4], the performance is actually increasing along with the layer number and only decreases in the last layer. These results by themselves may be misleading for the questions we address, since it may look like increasing the number of layers will always improve performance. In our bounds and experiments, we observe that this is not the case, and increasing the layer number in the encoder can make the performance significant worse than the optimal case (Figure 4, (c)). As opposed to [4], we connect the results to theoretical results. We also include a different set of experiments. We will discuss this in more detail. \n\n\nThank you again for your suggestions.\n\nThanks,\nAuthors\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2178/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2178/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Role of Embedding Complexity in Domain-invariant Representations", "authors": ["Ching-Yao Chuang", "Antonio Torralba", "Stefanie Jegelka"], "authorids": ["cychuang@mit.edu", "torralba@mit.edu", "stefje@mit.edu"], "keywords": ["domain adaptation", "domain-invariant representations", "model complexity", "theory", "deep learning"], "TL;DR": "We study the effect of the embedding complexity in learning domain-invariant representations and develop a strategy that mitigates sensitivity to it.", "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to generalize the hypothesis trained in a source domain to an unlabeled target domain.

Below we would like to address your concerns.\n\n1. The upper bound\n\nOur bound is not looser. As we point out in the paper, the lambda in equation (3) can be arbitrarily large when the label is not consistent. It is not clear to us that why eqn (3) is \u201cmore reasonable\u201d? We propose a term that includes the embedding complexity explicitly. We admit that complexity bounds for neural networks can be high, theoretically. Yet, our experiments show that the trends indicated in our bounds indeed appear to occur in practice.\n\nComparing to [1][2][3], we analyze the problem from the perspective of embedding complexity.\nThe bound in [1] does not explain the effect of the encoder, while our bound expresses it explicitly. In addition, [1] relies on common support, which does not hold for popular domain adaptation benchmarks (MNIST -> SVHN, Office31). We do not need such assumptions. \nIn [2], they propose a lower bound on the target error. Again, they do not explicitly consider the embedding complexity.

We will add more discussion of related work to the paper. With regard to proposition 5, we admit that it is a generalization of it, and we will add that to the paper. However, we use the result to explain the layer-wise trade-off, which is different from [1].\n\n\n2.

Furthermore, there are no creative tools in the mathematical proof part, which is a direct extension of the classic theory. \n(b) There is no analysis about the generalization when estimating this upper bound from finite samples.

It seems that only high-level classifier divergence is minimized.\n(e) Why minimizing the sum of divergences computed on all layers can control the proposed upper bound? It seems that if the embedding complexity of each layer is a constant, minimize divergence of a single layer can further minimize the minimum.

The main argument here is that when the total depth of layers in a neural network is fixed, tradeoffs exist between feature alignment and prediction power. Furthermore, the authors argue that richer feature extractor can sometimes significantly overfit the source domain, leading to a large risk on the target domain. \n\nOverall the paper is well-written and easy to follow. My major concern is that the paper, including the motivation and illustrative example, are too similar to previous work [1-2]. More detailed discussions are needed to highlight the difference of this work compared with [1-2]. The main contribution lies in Theorem 4. However, the upper bound is both loose and misleading. Compared with the original generalization upper bound [3], the one proposed in this paper contains a constant $\\lambda$ that contains FOUR optimal error terms. Note that the original one in [3] only contains two such terms. In fact even a bound containing 2 such terms could potentially be very loose, since it's perfectly fine that a hypothesis can have large risk on the source domain while still attaining a small risk on the target domain. The bound is misleading in the sense that this $\\lambda$ term cannot be computed or approximated, hence only the first two terms in (6) could be minimized in practice. However, this again can potentially lead to large target risk when the label distributions of source and target domains differ. \n\nThe experiments on using different number of layers of the network as feature extractors are quite interesting. The main message here is that general tradeoff exists with richer encoding function class. However, similar phenomenons have already been observed [4, Section 6.4], and it's not clear to me what's new here. \n\n[1].

By incorporating embedding complexity into the previous upper bound explicitly, the authors demonstrate the limitations of previous theories and algorithms. Based on their theoretical findings, the authors propose to control the embedding complexity with implicit regularization. Specifically, aligning source and target feature distributions in multiple layers controls both embedding complexity and domain discrepancy. The proposed algorithm can achieve similar performance as DANN with manual selection of embedding depth.\n\nBy noting that the hypothesis space can be decomposed in to the feature extractor and the classifier, the authors propose to address the domain discrepancy separately. D_H\\DeltaH is termed latent divergence, which the algorithm attempts to minimize. D_G\\DeltaG is treated as embedding complexity, which is the intrinsic property of the feature extractor. Thus, domain-invariant representations should seek a proper tradeoff between those two terms. \n\nThe paper is well-written and the contributions are stated clearly. The exploration on the layer division is really insightful.\n\nHowever, I have several concerns: \n1.\tThe proposed upper bound is insightful, but it has several limitations. Compared to the version applied to the feature space in equation (3), the proposed upper bound is looser. The embedding complexity terms includes two encoders, which are deep neural networks in practice, thus it can be excessively large. As the authors point out, in equation (3), the embedding complexity is not addressed explicitly, but it is implicit in the adaptability \\lambda in a more reasonable way. Previous works [1], [2], [3] have already taken them into consideration. Proposition 5 is a direct application of proposition 1 in [1].\n2.\tOn the claim of implicit regularization. By applying domain adversarial training to multiple layers, the authors claim that the encoder in higher layers is implicitly restricted. However, they do not validate this regularization effect. Is the embedding complexity controlled? Theoretical analysis or experimental results would be helpful.\n3.\tThe proposed MDM method seems to be incremental. [4] has probed into the effect of multi-layer adaptation strategy. Besides, applying domain adversarial training to many layers leads to more computational cost and may slow down training significantly. \n\n\n[1]Fredrik D Johansson, Rajesh Ranganath, and David Sontag.
