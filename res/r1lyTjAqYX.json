The thorough investigation is cited as a valuable contribution by all reviewers, with reviewer 1 noting that the study would be of interest to \"anyone using recurrent networks on RL tasks\". Empirical results on Atari and DMLab are impressive.\n\nThe reviewers noted several weaknesses in their original reviews. These included issues of clarity, a need for more detailed ablation studies, and need to more carefully document the empirical setup. A further question was raised on whether the empirical results could be complemented with theoretical or conceptual insights.\n\nThe authors carefully addressed all concerns raised during the reviewing and rebuttal period. They took exceptional care to clarify their writing, document experiment details, and ran a large set of additional experiments as suggested by the reviewers. The AC feels that the review period for the paper was particularly productive and would like to thank the reviewers and authors.\n\nThe reviewers and AC agree that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and should be accepted.", "confidence": "4: The area chair is confident but not absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Accept (Poster)", "title": "Valuable insights on training reinforcement learning with recurrent neural networks at scale"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Building on the recent successes of distributed training of RL agents, in this paper we investigate the training of RNN-based RL agents from distributed prioritized experience replay.

Precisely, the authors empirically compare a state-of-the-art training strategy (called zero start state) with three proposed training strategies (namely; zero-state with burn-in, stored-state and stored-state with burn-in). By comparing these different strategies through a proposed metric (Q-value discrepancy), the authors conclude on the effectiveness of the stored-state with burn-in strategy which they consider for the training of their proposed Recurrent Replay Distributed DQN (R2D2) agent. \n\nThe proposed analysis is well-motivated and has lead to significant results w.r.t. the state-of-the-art performances of RL agents.\n\nMajor concerns: My major concerns are three-fold:\n- The authors do not provide enough details about some \"informal\" experiments which are sometimes important to convince the reader about the relevance of the suggested insights (e.g., line 3 page 5). Beyond this point, the paper is generally hard to follow and reorganizing some sections (e.g., sec. 2.3 should appear after sec. 3 as it contains a lot of technical details) would certainly make the reading of the paper easier.\n- Hausknecht & Stone (2015) have proposed two training strategies (zero-state and Replaying whole episode trajectories see sec. 3 page 3). The authors should clarify why they did not considered the other states in their study.\n- The authors present results (mainly, fig. 2 and fig. 3) suggesting that the proposed R2D2 agent outperform the agents Ape-X and IMPALA, where R2D2 is trained using the aforementioned stored-state with burn-in strategy. It is not clear which are the considered training strategies adopted for the (compared to) state-of-the-art agents (Ape-X and IMPALA). The authors should clarify more precisely this point.\n\nMinor concerns: \n- The authors compare the different strategies only in terms of their proposed Q-value discrepancy metric. It could be interesting to consider other metrics in order to evaluate the ability of the methods on common aspects.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Building on the recent successes of distributed training of RL agents, in this paper we investigate the training of RNN-based RL agents from distributed prioritized experience replay.

For the other ablations (discount, life loss signal, value function rescaling vs clipped rewards) we considered a full Atari-57 ablation to be excessively costly in terms of computational resources and were not intending to provide those (beyond the already included 5 games x 3 seeds each). We could run those for the final version of the paper, with a single seed each, if you consider this data to be especially valuable, but would otherwise opt to use the chosen 5 games as representative. \n\nYour observation about the lower sample efficiency compared to Ape-X, this is indeed a great remark, and we have added a paragraph in the appendix to address this. Because of the very different batch characteristics of our sequence-based replay (64x80 instead of 512x1), our learner runs at approximately 1/4 of the updates-per-second compared to Ape-X, which results in a smaller \u2018replay ratio\u2019 (expected number of times an experienced observation is being replayed): approximately 0.8 (R2D2) vs 1.3 (Ape-X).

They experiment with several strategies to initialize the recurrent state when processing a sub-sequence sampled from the replay buffer: the best one consists in re-using the initial state computed when the sequence was originally played (even if it may now be outdated) but not doing any network update during the first k steps of the sequence (\u201cburn-in\u201d period). Using this scheme with LSTM units on top of traditional convolutional layers, along with a discount factor gamma = 0.997, leads to a significant improvement on Atari over the previous state-of-the-art, and competitive performance on DMLab.\n\nThe proposed technique (dubbed R2D2) is not particularly original (it is essentially \u201cjust\u201d using RNNs in Ape-X), but experiments are thorough, investigating several important aspects related to recurrence and memory to validate the approach. These findings are definitely quite relevant to anyone using recurrent networks on RL tasks. The results on Atari are particularly impressive and should be of high interest to researchers working on this benchmark. The fact that the same network architecture and hyper-parameters also work pretty well on DMLab is encouraging w.r.t. the generality of the method.\n\nI do have a couple of important concerns though. The first one is that a few potentially important changes were made to the \u201ctraditional\u201d settings typically used on Atari, which makes it difficult to perform a fair comparison to previously published results. Using gamma = 0.997 could by itself provide a significant boost, as hinted by results from \u201cMeta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning\u201d (where increasing gamma improved results significantly compared to the usual 0.99). Other potentially impactful changes are the absence of reward clipping (replaced with a rescaling scheme) and episodes not ending with life loss: I am not sure whether these make the task easier or harder, but they certainly change it to some extent (the \u201cdespite this\u201d above 5.1 suggests it would be harder, but this is not shown empirically). Fortunately, this concern is partially alleviated by Section 6 that shows feedforward networks do not perform as well as recurrent ones, but this is only verified on 5 games: a full benchmark comparison would have been more reassuring (as well as running R2D2 with more \u201cstandard\u201d Atari settings, even if it would mean using different hyper-parameters on DMLab).\n\nThe second important issue I see is that the authors do not seem to plan to share their code to reproduce their results. Given how time consuming and costly it is to run such experiments, and all potentially tricky implementation details (especially when dealing with recurrent networks), making this code available would be tremendously helpful to the research community (particularly since this paper claims a new SOTA on Atari). I am not giving too much weight to this issue in my review score since (unfortunately) the ICLR reviewer guidelines do not explicitly mention code sharing as a criterion, but I strongly hope the authors will consider it.\n\nBesides the above, I have a few additional small questions:\n1. \u201cWe also found no benefit from using the importance weighting that has been typically applied with prioritized replay\u201d: this is potentially surprising since this could be \u201cwrong\u201d, mathematically speaking. Do you think this is because of the lack of stochasticity in the environments? (I know Atari is deterministic, but I am not sure about DMLab)\n2. Fig. 3 (left) shows R2D2 struggling on some DMLab tasks. Do you have any idea why? The caption of Table 3 in the Appendix suggests the absence of specific reward clipping may be an issue for some tasks, but have you tried adding it back? I also wonder if maybe training a unique network per task may make DMLab harder, since IMPALA has shown some transfer learning occurring between DMLab tasks? (although the comparison might be to the \u201cdeep experts\u201d version of IMPALA \u2014 this is not clear in Fig. 3 \u2014 in which case this last question would be irrelevant)\n3. In Table 1, where do the IMPALA (PBT) numbers on DMLab come from? Looking at the current arxiv version of their paper, their Fig. 4 shows it goes above 70% in mean capped score, while your Table 1 reports only 61.5%. I also can\u2019t find a median score being reported on DMLab in their paper, did you try to compute it from their Fig. 9? And why don\u2019t you report their results on Atari?\n4.

We have attempted to address them in this revision.\n\n\u201cThe authors do not provide enough details about some \"informal\" experiments...\u201d\n\nWe have now significantly revised our LSTM training analysis to include a more detailed study that shows representation drift measured by both parameter lag (number of updates since experience was generated) and the q-value discrepancy, and for the same runs the mean episodic return, some of which is contained in the appendix. Additionally, we now have results as we vary burn-in from zero to 20 and up to 40 steps. We think this improves the section quite a bit, but we are still looking at edits to the paper to improve clarity further.\n\n\u201cBeyond this point, the paper is generally hard to follow and reorganizing some sections (e.g., sec. 2.3 should appear after sec. 3 as it contains a lot of technical details)...\u201d\n\nWe have moved one of these sections to the appendix and tried to improve the flow of the paper. Please let us know if this makes for a clearer read.\n\n\u201cHausknecht & Stone (2015) have proposed two training strategies (zero-state and Replaying whole episode trajectories see sec. 3 page 3). The authors should clarify\u2026\u201d\n\nHausknecht and Stone (2015) argued that the two strategies performed similarly in their experiments. We agree that a more thorough investigation of whole-trajectory-based training would be valuable, with special attention to sample correlation, variance and optimization settings. However, this seems to exceed the scope of the paper.\n\n\u201cThe authors present results (mainly, fig. 2 and fig. 3) suggesting that the proposed R2D2 agent outperform the agents Ape-X and IMPALA, where R2D2 is trained using the aforementioned stored-state with burn-in strategy. It is not clear\u2026\u201d\n\nIn all R2D2 experiments outside of the initial analysis section (where we specifically study these methods) we used the stored-state with 40-step burn-in method. We have attempted to make this more explicit in the revision. Ape-X does not use an RNN, and IMPALA is perhaps most like the \"entire episode trajectories\" approach in Hausknecht and Stone, but due to using the mostly on-policy actor-critic is hard to compare directly. To avoid any confusion, the reported Ape-X and IMPALA results are not our own reruns of the algorithms, but taken from their respective publications or private communication with the authors.\n\n\u201cThe authors compare the different strategies only in terms of their proposed Q-value discrepancy metric. It could be interesting to consider other metrics in order to evaluate the ability of the methods on common aspects.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned above, we have attempted to significantly improve this by including more information.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Building on the recent successes of distributed training of RL agents, in this paper we investigate the training of RNN-based RL agents from distributed prioritized experience replay.

We took your concerns to heart and have (as we discuss below) included it and rerun the experiments.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the same network architecture and hyper-parameters also work pretty well on DMLab is encouraging w.r.t. the generality of the method.\u201d\n\nWe want to thank the reviewer for making note of this aspect. It is something we consider particularly noteworthy considering common problems with robustness in deep RL.\n\n\u201c\u2026 a couple of important concerns though. The first one is that a few potentially important changes were made to the \u201ctraditional\u201d settings typically used on Atari, which makes it difficult to perform a fair comparison to previously published results.\u201d\n\nThis is a very reasonable concern and we have run a more thorough set of ablations on R2D2 which have now been included in the latest revision. These are not 100% completed yet, but are far enough along to give a clear picture. Specifically, we are taking your recommendations and comparing R2D2 with (1) Feed-forward only (already included, but now also done over all 57 Atari games), (2) Reward clipping but no value function rescaling, (3) Smaller discount (gamma = 0.99), and (4) end-episode on life-loss enabled. Only the last one is not included in the current revision, but will be included before revisions close.\n\n\u201cThe second important issue I see is that the authors do not seem to plan to share their code to reproduce their results. Given how time consuming and costly it is to run such experiments, and all potentially tricky implementation details (especially when dealing with recurrent networks), making this code available would be tremendously helpful to the research community (particularly since this paper claims a new SOTA on Atari)...  I strongly hope the authors will consider it.\u201d\n\nDistributed training, in particular, is an area where publically available open source code goes a long way towards reproducibility and progress in the field. Although we are not able to immediately release the code, we believe that we will be able to make the source available in the future.\n\n\n\u201c1. \u201cWe also found no benefit from using the importance weighting that has been typically applied with prioritized replay\u201d: this is potentially surprising since this could be \u201cwrong\u201d, mathematically speaking. Do you think this is because of the lack of stochasticity in the environments? (I know Atari is deterministic, but I am not sure about DMLab)\u201d\n\nThank you for pointing this out! This does make sense and we agree that in principle the lack of importance weighting when using prioritized replay is not well supported. We have now included it in the algorithm and rerun almost all of our experiments (ablations are still in progress). We have not found it necessary to retune hyper-parameters to support this change, and in fact found that re-introducing importance weighting did stabilise training on some of the DMLab levels and slightly improved overall performance.\n\n\u201c2. Fig. 3 (left) shows R2D2 struggling on some DMLab tasks. Do you have any idea why?\u201c\n\nWe do not use the asymmetric reward clipping of IMPALA and believe that this clipping is most helpful in some of the language tasks. We are in the process of running a very small test in which we add the asymmetric clipping to verify, but do not plan to add it to the algorithm itself in the interest of generality.\n\nAdditionally, one of the larger benefits of IMPALA PBT is the use of population-based training, and we suspect this is another reason for IMPALA occasionally out-performing R2D2.\n\n\u201c3. In Table 1, where do the IMPALA (PBT) numbers on DMLab come from?\u201d\n\nWe obtained the IMPALA results data from the authors of the cited paper: \u201cMulti-task Deep Reinforcement Learning with PopArt\u201d. However, after further discussion we believe the best approach would be to rerun IMPALA on our same hardware and training regime. Until this completes we will use the provided data, but again, we hope to replace this before the final revision.\n\n\u201cAnd finally a few minor comments / suggestions:\u201d\n\nThank you for these comments and suggestions, we have made the corresponding edits to clarify things and fix mistakes. We should also mention that while doing this we fixed a bug that limited Atari training episode times to 14 minutes (50K frames) instead of 30 minutes (108K frames), this slightly improves some of our Atari results.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Building on the recent successes of distributed training of RL agents, in this paper we investigate the training of RNN-based RL agents from distributed prioritized experience replay.

The authors present \"R2DR\" algorithm as a A+B approach from previous works (actually, R2D2 is an Ape-X-like agent using LTSM), as well as an empirical study of a number of ways for training RNN from replay in terms of the effects of parameter lag (and potential alleviating actions) and sample-afficiency. The results presented show impressive performance in Atari-57 and DMLab-30 benchmarks.\n\nIn summary, this is a very nice paper in which the authors attack a challenging task and empirically confirm that RNN agents generalise far better when scaling up through parallelisation and distributed training allows them to benefit from huge experience. The results obtained in ALE and DMLab improves significantly upon the SOTA works, showing that the trend-line in those benchmarks seem to have been broken. \n\nFurthermore, the paper presents their approach/analyses in a well-structured manner and sufficient clarity to retrace the essential contribution. The background and results are well-contextualised with relevant related work. \n\nMy only major comments are that I\u2019m a bit skeptical about the lack of a more thorough (theoretical) analysis supporting their empirical findings (what gives me food for thought is that LSTM helps that much on even fully observable games such as Ms. Pacman); and the usual caveats regarding evaluation: evaluation conditions aren't well standardized so the different systems (Ape-X, IMPALA, Reactor, Rainbow, AC3 Gorilla, C51, etc.) aren't all comparable. These sort of papers would benefit from a more formal/comprehensive evaluation by means of an explicit enumeration of all the dimensions relevant for their analysis: the data, the knowledge, the software, the hardware, manipulation, computation and, of course, performance, etc. However only some of then are (partially) provided.   \n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Building on the recent successes of distributed training of RL agents, in this paper we investigate the training of RNN-based RL agents from distributed prioritized experience replay.

Towards the aim of understanding R2D2's empirical performance, we contributed a study of the effects of parameter lag on representation drift and recurrent state staleness, potential mitigation strategies, and the memory-dependence in a learned recurrent policy.\n\nThis paper focuses on presenting and analyzing effective ways of training a recurrent memory from replay, resulting in a more universal agent achieving SOTA results across multiple environment suites with a single set of parameters.

A naive conversion from Ape-X to R2D2, using Table 1 from the Ape-X paper, accounting for the reduced wall time (3 vs 5 days) and number of actors (360 vs. 256) seems to suggest roughly 10 billion frames per game, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something that would affect these calculations.

It is the first agent to exceed human-level performance in 52 of the 57 Atari games.", "keywords": ["RNN", "LSTM", "experience replay", "distributed training", "reinforcement learning"], "authorids": ["skapturowski@google.com", "ostrovski@google.com", "johnquan@google.com", "munos@google.com", "wdabney@google.com"], "authors": ["Steven Kapturowski", "Georg Ostrovski", "John Quan", "Remi Munos", "Will Dabney"], "TL;DR": "Investigation on combining recurrent neural networks and experience replay leading to state-of-the-art agent on both Atari-57 and DMLab-30 using single set of hyper-parameters.", "pdf": "/pdf/387fb2fcee8f74c53cf707a9856f40c458f33933.pdf", "paperhash": "kapturowski|recurrent_experience_replay_in_distributed_reinforcement_learning", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nkapturowski2018recurrent,\ntitle={Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning},\nauthor={Steven Kapturowski and Georg Ostrovski and Will Dabney and John Quan and Remi Munos},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1lyTjAqYX},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper765/Public_Comment", "rdate": null, "ddate": null, "expdate": null, "duedate": null, "tmdate": 1542311757872, "tddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "reply": {"signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed."}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "forum": "r1lyTjAqYX", "readers": {"description": "Select all user groups that should be able to read this comment.", "value-dropdown-hierarchy": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "replyto": null, "content": {"comment": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters)."}, "title": {"value-regex": ".{1,500}", "required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment."}}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values-copied": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference", "{signatures}"]}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "invitees": ["~"], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper765/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "multiReply": true, "taskCompletionCount": null, "transform": null, "cdate": 1542311757872}}}], "count": 23}
