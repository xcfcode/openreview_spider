Note that, in the manuscript we already mention an analysis finding that embeddings based on the dot product and the Euclidean distance - both very common measures of psychological similarity / distance - are very similar in performance and interpretability.\n\nThe use of Luce's choice rule with exponential weights is a very common approach for arbitrating between probabilistic choices, not only in supervised machine learning, but also in game theory and reinforcement learning (e.g. Sutton & Barto, 2001), and there is strong empirical support for its use in humans (e.g. Daw et al., 2006 - Nature). In the context of behavioral similarity, there is strong evidence that the probability of choice is exponentially related to psychological distance, as reviewed in Xu et al. (2011).\n\nThe sparsity constraint is a reasonable assumption given that, without sparsity, all concepts would carry all dimensions, which would be in contrast to what is found empirically for feature norms of real-world objects that turn out to be sparse (see McRae et al. 2005). Note that if a non-sparse model was best for predicting the data, cross-validation would have revealed a lambda very close to 0 (our lambda was 0.0080, which was much larger than the grid spacing 0.0001, and as mentioned above, a penalty of 0.0270 or higher would result in all dimensions being shrunk to 0).\n\nSince our aim was to obtain interpretable embeddings, we used the constraint of non-negativity, which in the word embedding literature has been found to improve interpretability (Murphy et al. 2012). In response to the reviewer comment, we ran a similar analysis without non-negativity and sparsity constraints which, as expected, led to comparable performance (0.6453) and 18 dimensions which turned out to be much less interpretable. If \u201ctrue\u201d dimensions turn out to be signed, we expect SPoSE dimensions to either be shifted to the positive range or split into positive and negative parts. Importantly, this transformation does not affect their interpretability.\n\n**Updated / new text**\n\u201cWe assume that each feature/dimension x_if in the vector x_i is real and non-negative, so as to make it interpretable as the *degree* to which the aspect of meaning it represents is present and influences subject behavior (Murphy et al. 2012).. Further, in accordance with empirical findings, we expect features/dimensions to be sparse (McRae et al. 2005), which motivated us add a sparsity parameter to our model.\u201d\n\n**References**\nRichard S.

For example model dimension: Is you claim that \"D=49\" is a law of human nature?\n\nWe do not attempt to recover the \"true\" dimensionality of the embedding, but rather a \u201cuseful\u201d embedding to explain the data and provide interpretability. We can conclude from our results that there exist at least 49 useful embedding dimensions; it is possible that, after collecting more data, we might find more dimensions. As detailed in 2.2. under \u201cParameter fitting\u201d, we fit a model with a large initial number of dimensions (in this case, 90), but the L1 shrinkage (with cross-validated lambda) naturally causes many of dimensions to have a maximum weight close to zero. We set a threshold to eliminate dimensions below a certain average weight, which results in an embedding with a much smaller number of dimensions. In our current dataset, this procedure resulted in picking an L1 penalty equal to 0.0080 (a penalty of 0.0270 or higher would result in all dimensions being shrunk to 0). We deleted all dimensions with average weight less than 0.02, resulting in the 49 dimensions presented.\n\n\n> The presentation of the inference process is clear. Not so clear what the uncertainties are\n\nFor any triplet presented to a participant, there are two possible sources of randomness. One is variation in the decision-making process of the participant. The choice of the participant may be affected by biases such as ordering of the objects, and by uncontrolled factors such as their physiological state. A second source of variation is differences in the decision-making process between participants. Participants with different personalities and worldviews may evaluate the similarity of objects in different ways. Our model accounts for both sources of uncertainty by representing the choice for a given triplet for a random participant as a draw from a multinomial distribution, with probabilities given by equation 2, page 3.\n\n\n> But the data quality is unclear.\n\nSee above comments clarifying the quality of the data. We have also added a description to the text specifying more precisely what the exclusion criteria were and how many triplets were excluded.\n\n**Updated / new text**\n\u201cThe dataset in this paper contains all of the data acquired to date, comprising judgments on 1,450,119 randomly selected triplets, roughly 0.13% out of all possible triplets using the 1,854 concepts. These were the triplets remaining after excluding AMT participants that showed evidence of inappropriate subject behavior, namely if responses were unusually fast, exhibited systematic response bias, or were empty (137,281 triplets or 8.65%).\u201d"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Revealing interpretable object representations from human behavior", "abstract": "To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories.

To address their criticisms, below and in the updated text we more carefully describe the experiment. In addition, we better justify the heuristics by being more explicit about how they are based on previous studies and empirical evidence, and we ran an additional analysis based on the reviewer\u2019s comment on our modeling choices. Note that while the scale of our experimental data - as pointed out by the reviewer - strongly contributes to the significance of our work, we are not aware of comparable work that has revealed interpretable dimensions underlying human behavior from similarity ratings. It is, in fact, the *combination* of scale and the use of our sparse non-negative model that makes this work unique. As mentioned in the manuscript, all data will be released at the end of the study. We hope that our responses will provide the reviewer with the information sufficient to raise their rating above the acceptance threshold.\n  \n\n> What are the precise instructions, how are the object/images presented (it is well known that relative positions, asymmetry, etc can play an important role), are there any temporal/learning effects (how clear is the task to the workers?).\n\nThe reviewer raises a number of points that we did not address at length in the paper due to space constraints and which, in our opinion, were not critical to reproducing the results. However, we fully agree that it is important to add further justification, which we will do in this review and in the manuscript, as space permits. Please note that we also tried to better highlight some of the details (e.g. the release of the data) which were already present in the manuscript.\n\nThe precise instructions to the workers were:\n\u201cIn each round, you will see three pictures each showing an object or \"thing\". Two of them will be more similar to each other. Your job is to select the *odd-one out* by clicking on it. Sometimes the decision is very difficult. Base your decision _only_ on the most prominent object or \"thing\" in an image.\u201c\nNote that these instructions were intentionally left rather open, so as to allow workers to decide according to whatever criteria were most salient to them for carrying out the task.\n\nRegarding the issues mentioned by the reviewer (effects of temporal learning, effects of position, symmetry, etc.), we empirically tested the validity of the method in a separate study before acquiring the large-scale dataset. This study is extensive in itself and will thus be published separately. In it, we acquired similarity ratings for a set of 48 objects and a separate set of 92 objects using the triplet odd-one-out task. We then compared two other common similarity tasks (pairwise similarity and object arrangement) to the triplet odd-one-out task and related them to both synset embeddings and deep convolutional neural networks as well as human brain data (functional MRI and magnetoencephalography). The triplet odd-one-out task was highly correlated with the other two similarity tasks, overall, and performed equally well or better than those tasks in predicting embeddings and human brain data. This demonstrates that, all issues raised by the reviewer aside, the triplet odd-one-out task is as good or better than two common state-of-the-art alternatives for human similarity judgments.\n\nNote that any preference of position or sequence effects would only affect the variance of the estimates, not the bias. Most workers only carried out very few trials, weakening the possible contribution of learning effects to bias. If there was any strong bias present in the data, we believe that the model could not have performed as close to optimal as it did. However, we agree with the reviewer that, in the future, it would be interesting and important to investigate possible learning effects and, specifically, individual differences in how humans use those dimensions. This is, however, beyond the scope of the present work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Revealing interpretable object representations from human behavior", "abstract": "To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories.

We agree that the prediction from CSLB features is particularly interesting, and we are currently working on improving this further by interpolating to other objects in a semi-supervised manner (similar to what was proposed by the reviewer). We also strongly agree that testing additional embeddings would be very interesting! For the present work, we focused on synset embeddings because they represent a closer match to the meaning of each individual object than word embeddings would and provide a one-to-one match for the meanings. For example, our list contains four different meanings for the object named by the word \u201cbaton\u201d, referring to (1) an item in relay races, (2) in twirling, (3) a weapon used by police, and (4) an item used by a musical conductor. Due to the novelty of this line of research, to our knowledge there are no other synset embeddings available than the ones we used, and we included both a 50d dense and a 300d dense version. In addition, we would have liked to include sparse positive synset embeddings as a reference, however those are currently not available; for that reason, we included NNSE word embeddings instead. In the future, we would like to add sparse positive synset embeddings and test their interpretability relative to our similarity embedding. We hope this will underline the unique contribution of a behavior-based similarity embedding presented here.\n\nIn addition, we would like to thank the reviewer for their idea on how to extend the embedding. Indeed, we are currently working on predicting similarities for other concepts and images from pretrained synset vectors and activations in deep convolutional neural networks.

The authors have collected the dataset themselves and have rating of sets of 3 objects from 1854 unique objects. They end up with a space (SPoSE) with relatively low dimensionality with respect to usual word embeddings (49 dimension) but perhaps not surprising when considering the small size of the words to embed. The authors run a set of experiment to show the usefulness of SPoSE. The most interesting one is the prediction of its dimensions by the CSLB features, which reveals a nice clustering in the different SPoSE dimensions. Perhaps the results would be a little more convincing if additional common word embeddings were also tested.\n\nDue to the different objects used in the different datasets, some of the experiments have a smaller set of words. A good extension of this work would be to combine a text-derived embedding  or the synsets to interpolate the SPoSE dimensions for missing words in the original set. Or perhaps the object similarity ratings could be used in a semi-supervised setting to inform the learning of a co-occurence word embedding. This will allow the model to better describe a larger set of words. Another possible extension is to test this larger set of words on a non-behavioral NLP task to show possible improvements that the behavioral data and the interpretable space give.\n\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1536/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Revealing interpretable object representations from human behavior", "abstract": "To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories.
