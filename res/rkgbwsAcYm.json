This distance is then used in the loss function and through back-propagation incorporates knowledge from the source network.

The work  (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) was cited in our original submission. We fully agree that it is highly  relevant to our paper. The connections between these works have been briefly stated at the last paragraph of related work in our original paper. Below we would like to elaborate the major differences. \n\nWe have different goals. Zagoruyko & Komodakis aim to obtain a different (and smaller) network to perform the same task.  While DELTA use a similar attention mechanism, we aim to obtain a network to perform a different task. With the different goal, we have to adopt a similar but distinct approach for attention to enable efficient knowledge transfer. \n \nMethodologies. Our definition of attention is based on the discriminant capacity of each filter in the network trained on the source domain as applied to the target domain.  In this approach, we are able to assign the weights to the regularizer for EACH filter for optimizing knowledge transfer. With such attention (accuracy contribution of each filter), DELTA assign higher weights to the useful filters and re-use filters that do not classify the target data well (i.e., to make those filter  freely optimized).  \n\nOn the other hand, Zagoruyko & Komodakis defined attention as the data representation obtained by teacher networks, where student networks are guided to obtain similar representation on the same data. Attention transfer considers attention as an objective that student needs to learn from teacher. It implements attention as the activation map, i.e, the aggregation of feature maps generated by all filters (in the same map) while we assign weight to each filter so that some of the filters can be re-used for new tasks.

We summarize Reviewer 1\u2019s major concerns as following two questions and we try to respond these two answers accordingly.\n\nQ1. \u201cthe amount of training time needed to pre-train using the L-2 FE and target labels should be mentioned as it seems that for large network, and large data, this can be a factor\u201d\n\nResponse: Thanks for the comment. We totally agree that the time-consumption of L2-FE adaption and attention learning should be considered as the overhead of our method. Indeed, the time spent by L2-FE adaption and attention learning is no more than 50% of overall training time.  For example, DELTA (w/o Attention) requires 139 minutes on Caltech30 task transferring from Resnet-101 pre-trained model, while DELTA (with Attention) consumes 197 minutes (42% more than DELTA w/o Attention which doesn\u2019t need L2-FE adaption and attention learning). Furthermore, L2-SP takes124 minutes and L2 spends 115 minutes on the same task in the same settings. It is thus reasonable to conclude the extra time consumption on L2-FE adaption and attention learning does not add a significant overhead to common deep transfer learning practices. \n\nWhen we further breakdown such time overhead, we found that the major overhead is due to the attention learning, where for each filter forward inference is needed to estimate the contribution of such filter to the overall accuracy. It should not be a significant performance bottleneck even for a large dataset, as the number of filters needed to evaluate might be fixed with given scratch for transfer learning.  Note that one key contribution made in this manuscript is to improve the deep transfer learning via feature-map based regularization through introducing attention mechanism. All in all, many thanks for your comments. We are revising the manuscript, including the discussion on time consumption, accordingly.\n\nQ.2 The choice of Resnet, at least one of the more recent networks for object detection (Inception, YOLO etc.)  would be a good add\n\nResponse: Thanks for comments. We agree to incorporate more results and neural network architectures. We are revising the manuscript with supplementary experiments on both new architecture (inception v3) and datasets(CUB-200-2011[1], Food-101[2]). The results of above experiments will be reported in our new version.\n\n[1] C.Wah,S.Branson,P.Welinder,P.Perona,andS.Belongie. The caltech-ucsd birds-200-2011 dataset.

We summarize and respond Reviewer 3\u2019s concerns as follow.\n\nQ1. I have had some difficulty in understanding precisely how the \"behavior\" is really regularized. While I understand what is depicted in Figure 1 I'm not completely sure this really means that the network behavior is regularized rather than simply correlating the two outputs\n\nResponse: Thanks for your comments. Yes, one intuition of our regularizer for deep transfer learning is to ensure the \u201cbehavior\u201d of outer layers of the target network being similar to the source one. In this context,  \u201cbehavior\u201d suggests functional preservation where similar inputs will produce similar outputs.  To measure similarity, however, is difficult.  Using feature map is a reasonable choice but such choice has many problems. First of all, feature maps/outer layer outputs are large with noise and redundancy. We have to understand which parts of feature maps (outputs) would help for the classification on the target task (rather than source task). In this way, an attention mechanism has been proposed to re-weight the output of each filter in out layers. Then, with the obtained attention, we characterize the divergence of feature maps/outputs between source/target networks as the attention-weighted squared-Euclidian distance between the feature maps. In this way, the regularizer to \u201ccorrelate\u201d the output has been designed. We further leverage some optimization paradigms, such as starting point as reference, to accelerate the deep transfer learning with better efficiency and effectiveness. Please refer to our methodologies section for details.\n\n\nQ2. the authors present in Figure 4 some qualitative examples but I would have expected to see some quantitative evaluation of this. I would have liked to see experiments on some larger datasets that are commonly used in computer vision\n\n\nResponse: Thanks for your comments. Yes, eventually, handling large target dataset is an interesting topic in deep transfer learning research. Actually, we usually assume the target dataset size is relevantly small. As was stated in the first paragraph of the first section, the deep transfer learning studied here is originally motivated by the need of deep learning from small datasets. In such cases, CNNs are not be able to learn generalizable features from the small training sets, while weights of pre-trained networks with rich features learned from large datasets are assumed to help. To address your comments, we will include the results of supplementary experiments on both new architecture (inception v3) and datasets (CUB-200-2011[1], Food-101[2]). The new results will be reported in our incoming revision.\n\n[1] C.Wah,S.Branson,P.Welinder,P.Perona,andS.Belongie. The caltech-ucsd birds-200-2011 dataset.

The results in Figure 4 tend to show that with the attention mechanism there is a central bias and most of the results tend to be concentrated on the center of the image\n\nResponse: Thanks for your comments for catching the possible location bias. In our experiments we do not find evidence that our attention mechanism has a strong central bias. It pays attention to the parts of feature maps that are with discriminant capacities. The attention illustrated on dog images is just a coincidence. In our revised version, we plan to present more attention results to avoid the impression of central bias. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper237/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper237/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper237/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DELTA: DEEP LEARNING TRANSFER USING FEATURE MAP WITH ATTENTION FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS", "abstract": "Transfer learning through fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network with an extremely large dataset, such as ImageNet, can significantly accelerate training while the accuracy is frequently bottlenecked by the limited dataset size of the new target task.

We summarize the major concerns of Reviewer 2 as following:\n\nQ1. There needs evidence of (statistically) significant performance boosting\n\nResponse: Thanks for your comments. In our experiments, we run DELTA and other baselines for multiple times under various settings, then estimate the mean accuracy with error bars in Tables 1. We further compare the worst-case performance (the lowest accuracy) of DELTA to the best-case performance (the highest accuracy) of rest baselines under each setting. The results suggest that DELTA can always perform better than the baseline algorithms, as its worst-case performance is marginally better than the best-case performance of baselines in our experiments. To address your comments, we will include supplementary experiments on some new neural architectures (inception v3) and datasets (CUB-200-2011[1], Food-101[2]). The new results will be compared and reported in our incoming revision.\n\nQ2. What is the major contributions made in this paper.\n\nResponse:  Thanks for your comment. Our key innovation is the concept that we call \"unactivated channel re-usage\u201d. Specifically we demonstrate by experiments and case studies that, when we perform transfer learning in CNN, some of the convolution channels are useless in transfer learning. In contrast to the common belief that lower level convolution channels are for common feature extraction, higher level channels are for task-specific feature extraction, we demonstrate that there are channels that are useful (and useless) at all different levels. \n\nOur technical contribution is to find an approach to identify those \u201ctransferable channels\u201d and preserve them through regularization and identify those \u201cuntransferable channels\u201d and reuse them, using an attention mechanism with feature map regularization. \n\nCompared to existing deep transfer learning paradigms reusing the weights of outer layers of source networks, DELTA intends to constrain on the difference of the outputs (e.g., feature maps) rather than the weights between source/target networks. Compared to the knowledge distillation alike solution (if they are adopted for transfer learning), DELTA proposes a novel attention mechanism to make target network stay focused on the important features with high discriminant powers for knowledge transfer. To the best of knowledge, we are the first to regularize the divergence of the feature maps outputted by the outer layers of the source/target networks, with attention mechanisms, for deep transfer learning.\n\nUsing image classification and case studies we demonstrate the usefulness of our insights. In addition, we plan to further demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods by adding supplementary experiments on both new architecture(inception v3) and datasets(CUB-200-2011[1], Food-101[2]). Those results will be reported in our new version.\n\n[1] C.Wah,S.Branson,P.Welinder,P.Perona,andS.Belongie. The caltech-ucsd birds-200-2011 dataset.

The authors have noticed that some of the state of the art methods (they use Li et al - ICML18 as the main reference) are using only some simple normalization for improving the transfer learning and as such they propose preserving the outer layer output of the target network and aligning it with the one of the source network. On top of that they also propose modeling the difference of feature maps considering an attention mechanism obtain through supervised learning. \n\nThe idea in itself is interesting and valuable. However, I have had some difficulty in understanding precisely how the \"behavior\" is really regularized. While I understand what is depicted in Figure 1 I'm not completely sure this really means that the network behavior is regularized rather than simply correlating the two outputs. In the evaluation, the authors present in Figure 4 some qualitative examples but I would have expected to see some quantitative evaluation of this. I would have liked to see experiments on some larger datasets that are commonly used in computer vision (e.g., Caltech 256 is rather old even if it has been used in Li et al.). The quantitative results in Table 1 and 2 indicate some slight improvement but I'm not completely convinced that this is really significant in the end. The results in Figure 4 tend to show that with the attention mechanism there is a central bias and most of the results tend to be concentrated on the center of the image (in this case the result might also be correct but the examples presented are not too eloquent). \n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper237/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "DELTA: DEEP LEARNING TRANSFER USING FEATURE MAP WITH ATTENTION FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS", "abstract": "Transfer learning through fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network with an extremely large dataset, such as ImageNet, can significantly accelerate training while the accuracy is frequently bottlenecked by the limited dataset size of the new target task.

In this paper, we propose a novel regularized transfer learning framework DELTA, namely DEep Learning Transfer using Feature Map with Attention. Instead of constraining the weights of neural network, DELTA aims to preserve the outer layer outputs of the target network.
