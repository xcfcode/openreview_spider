Some math would have helped making the paper easier to read and more set-contained.\n\nJustification of recommendation:\n\nAlthough experimental results clearly show the benefit of the proposed method, I find several components of the pipeline to be to cumbersome to be used in practice (specifically: data re-generation per method, network re-training per method, network training per camera, relying on ground texture). Moreover, the proposed method feels more like a work-around to make things look better with clothing prediction, rather than an attempt to trying to solve the actual problem, i.e. learning high frequency information with neural networks. \n\nPost author response:\nAfter having carefully read the author's response and additional reviews, I confirm my original recommendation.

We provide clarifications to specific comments and concerns below.\n\n**\u201cI think the proposed methodology is not particularly innovative, and it acts in a controlled scenario: the method is a CNN developed to work in a (virtual) setup that requires several prior knowledge: the view (also, it need to be trained for every different one), the pose parameters (making it also dependent on the animation system), the garment, the texture, and the light condition.\u201d**\n\nFor numerous cloth applications such as virtual try-on and AR/VR systems, the information listed above is known or can easily be inferred. For instance, any state-of-the-art body pose estimation network can be used to recover pose from RGB images, and the camera view, texture, and lighting condition can also be given or estimated. Using this knowledge as input to texture sliding does not mean our method can only be applied to a controlled scenario. Furthermore, our texture sliding method is not constrained to any specific garment - we use the T-shirt dataset to evaluate our method on available real world cloth data.\n\n**\u201cFinally, the shown examples and experiments are limited to a few setups, without stressing the limits of the method. I am wondering how does the method performs training a different kind of garments with higher mobility (e.g. skirts) or subject to non-isometric deformations (e.g. zip clothes) or with irregular textures at higher frequencies (e.g. a shirt with a clear logo).\u201d**\n\nReal world garments such as skirts or zipped clothes are currently unavailable, so we leave evaluation on such articles of clothing to future work. However, we note that predicting wrinkles/folds on a T-shirt is perhaps more challenging than complex outfits, where pre-baked wrinkles can be added to enhance realism rather than predicting all high frequency detail. In addition, we believe that the real textures used in our paper (checkerboard, stripes) best highlights cloth deformation.\n\n**\u201cI am not surprised that the method improves the starting one, and I would suggest to compare it with others refinement baselines (e.g. PCA, or nearest neighbor in the training set). Also, the proposed subdivision step seems harmful in Table 2 (and not helpful in Sup.Mat. Table 1), and it is unexpected to me: I think would be good including a comment in the text.\u201d**\n\nWe consider the baseline for our method to be the inferred cloth from Jin et al. 2020, as the goal of the TSNN is to add high frequency detail to overly smooth network predictions. With regards to subdivision, we agree that the results are initially unexpected and updated Section E to comment on the results of Table 1 in the supplemental material. \n\n**\u201cFinally, I understand that the focus of the paper is in a specific computer graphic domain, but while it is not the precise scope of the paper, I think would be interesting also to show the method limits when some of these priors elements are estimated for real-world cases (e.g. using pose regression techniques to infer the parameters). If this method can be applied also in real scenarios it would be really interesting.\u201d**\n\nThe cloth dataset we use for evaluation is a real world dataset, as the T-shirt and body were scanned from the real world and simulated for each pose. That said, we are interested in applying texture sliding to a wider range of garments and the application of cloth capture - these are avenues for future work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper694/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper694/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recovering Geometric Information with Learned Texture Perturbations", "authorids": ["~Jane_Wu2", "yxjin@stanford.edu", "zhenglin@stanford.edu", "hui.zhou@jd.com", "~Ronald_Fedkiw1"], "authors": ["Jane Wu", "Yongxu Jin", "Zhenglin Geng", "Hui Zhou", "Ronald Fedkiw"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Regularization is used to avoid overfitting when training a neural network; unfortunately, this reduces the attainable level of detail hindering the ability to capture high-frequency information present in the training data.

We provide clarifications to specific comments and concerns below.\n\n**\u201cIt is hard to understand what to convey in Section 3.1. Especially, the following sentence just states the problem without how to address it. \u2018This assumes linearity, which is only valid when the triangles are small enough to capture the inherent nonlinearities in a piecewise linear sense; moreover, folds and wrinkles can create significant nonlinearity.\u2019\u201d**\n\nSection 3.1 explains how taking a per-vertex, rather than per-point, approach to texture sliding can fail to capture nonlinearities in the texture when the triangles in a mesh are too large. This is because barycentric interpolation assumes linearity while folds and wrinkles are often highly nonlinear in nature. Figure 2 illustrates this effect.\n\n**\u201cIt is difficult to follow what authors intend to convey in Figure 2.\u201c**\n\nBuilding on the discussion above, Figure 2 visualizes the errors caused by the linearity assumption of barycentric interpolation. The green triangle illustrates how the cloth texture would be barycentrically interpolated from the three triangle vertices *if the cloth mesh had such a large triangle*, but the yellow outline illustrates the region of the texture image that the triangle should encompass from the original cloth mesh. \n\n**\u201cTwo methods in Section 3.2 are hard to interpret.\u201c**\n\nIn Section 3.2 we do not present two methods, but rather consider the silhouette differences between the ground truth and inferred mesh when they are viewed from a specific camera view.\n\n**\u201cIt is needed to mark both camera view and pose in Figure 4.\u201c**\n\nFigure 4 is a graphical illustration of our ray intersection method for texture sliding. It is not meant to depict ground truth data, thus we do not label the specific camera view and pose.\n\n**\u201cAlgorithm stating the overall procedure of the proposed method would improve the readability.\u201c**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We describe the algorithm for our texture sliding data generation method in Section 4.1, and the reader can refer to our code for further details (which we can release).\n\n**\u201cWhat is 'UV space' in Section 5?\u201c**\n\nUV space refers to the process of UV mapping, i.e. the process of projecting a 2D texture image to a 3D mesh by assigning 2D texture coordinates in UV space.\n\n**\u201cHow did you estimate the joint angles theta_k?\u201c**\n\nThe joint angles are the input to the TSNN network, and are thus not estimated.\n\n**\u201cWhat data did you use for training/validating/testing the networks?\u201c**\n\nPlease refer to Section 5 for details on the data we use, beginning with \u201cThe inferred cloth data we chose to correct are predictions of the T-shirt meshes from Jin et al. 2020\u2026\u201d\n\n**\u201cComparative study seems to be insufficient. It seems that a more thorough performance analysis is needed.\u201c**\n\nWe compare the TSNN (with and without subdivision) to Jin et al. 2020, which is a current state-of-the-art approach to cloth shape prediction. Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that texture sliding effectively models material behavior and adds high frequency wrinkles/folds to overly smooth cloth predictions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper694/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper694/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recovering Geometric Information with Learned Texture Perturbations", "authorids": ["~Jane_Wu2", "yxjin@stanford.edu", "zhenglin@stanford.edu", "hui.zhou@jd.com", "~Ronald_Fedkiw1"], "authors": ["Jane Wu", "Yongxu Jin", "Zhenglin Geng", "Hui Zhou", "Ronald Fedkiw"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Regularization is used to avoid overfitting when training a neural network; unfortunately, this reduces the attainable level of detail hindering the ability to capture high-frequency information present in the training data.

We provide clarifications to specific comments and concerns below.\n\n**\u201cThe paper claims to prevent overfitting induced from regularization and claim the proposed strategy can recover high-frequency details via procedurally embedded low-frequency data, however, the proposed method is specifically designed for 3D meshes (texture perturbation), it's not clear how does the method work with other machine learning representations, e.g. 2D image. At least, from my point view, this is not a trivial extension, and the paper didn't show the experiments beyond the 3D clothing mesh. I would suggest the authors turn down the claims in the paper.\u201d**\n\nWe would like to clarify that the texture sliding method we propose is indeed designed for 3D meshes. However, our method advocates for a more general machine learning strategy of recovering high frequency detail via low-frequency embeddings.\n\n**\u201cThe experiments on 3D reconstruction is not well enough. The paper argues to learn the geometric details, thus a careful analysis of the reconstructed 3D geometry (especially emphasizing on the geometric details) would be more convincing. However, the paper only presented one example of the final result (Fig.12/13), it would be better to: a) show more qualitative results, b) show quantitative comparisons with more baselines, e.g. a network that directly predicts the vertex offset in the clothing mesh. c). the quantitative analysis on the geometric details, how good the method can capture the details comparing with the baselines.\u201d**\n\n(a) Please see Appendix B in our supplemental material for more examples of reconstructed 3D geometry. (b) We compare the TSNN (with and without subdivision) to Jin et al. 2020, which is the only baseline for cloth shape inference with code and data made available to us. We note that SMPL-based methods require that the body is parameterized by the SMPL PCA basis, which is not the case with the body we use. (c) A quantitative analysis of how well our method captures geometric details is encapsulated by the sqrt MSE results we report. In addition, we visualized the per-vertex prediction errors in Figure 9c and provide more examples in the supplemental material (Figure 10c).\n\n**\u201cThe scope of the paper is narrow. It's not trivial to extend the pipeline in the paper for a general machine learning representation. Also, in the paper, recovering 3D shapes requires post-processing and smoothing to make the shape look good.\u201d**\n\nPlease see above for clarification on the scope of our paper. Adding high frequency wrinkles/folds to virtual cloth is an established area of work (discussed under \u201cWrinkles and Folds\u201d in Section 2). While not required, the physical postprocess we use (Geng et al. 2020) further smooths the output of the TSNN and demonstrates that applying the postprocess to the TSNN results in greater wrinkling detail than when applied to Jin et al. 2020.

In this paper, our contributions focus on the specific application of predicting cloth geometry from 3D pose. Since the 3D cloth mesh can be rendered from any camera view, one only needs to train two TSNNs to reconstruct the ground truth cloth using triangulation. When one is only interested in the rendered cloth appearance, e.g. in 2D image space, there is also no need to train a different network for many different views as a small number of cameras can be strategically placed and interpolated from (as shown in Figure 11). Thus, the TSNN is both an efficient and generalizable approach to adding high-frequency details to overly smooth 3D geometry.\n\nIn accordance with reviewer feedback, we have made the following changes to our submission:\n* We updated our discussion of the dataset in Section 5 to mention ground truth cloth mesh texture coordinates (R2).\n* We added commentary in Section E of our supplemental material to address the results of subdividing the cloth meshes (R1).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper694/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper694/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Recovering Geometric Information with Learned Texture Perturbations", "authorids": ["~Jane_Wu2", "yxjin@stanford.edu", "zhenglin@stanford.edu", "hui.zhou@jd.com", "~Ronald_Fedkiw1"], "authors": ["Jane Wu", "Yongxu Jin", "Zhenglin Geng", "Hui Zhou", "Ronald Fedkiw"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Regularization is used to avoid overfitting when training a neural network; unfortunately, this reduces the attainable level of detail hindering the ability to capture high-frequency information present in the training data.

The main idea is to train a network to learn the 2D offset in the UV space for a given pose and view. The paper shows results using a t-shirt, on interpolating to novel views and 3D reconstruction by correcting the output of a state of the art method.\n\nPROS\n1) Comparison:\nThe paper improves a state-of-the-art method (Jin et al. 2020), suggesting that the proposed module could be applied by other methods as post-processing.\n\n2) Applicability:\nI think the idea could be easily applicable in other tissues domains (e.g. soft-tissue modeling for humans, animals fur). \n\nCONS\n1) Method and Experiments:\n\n- I think the proposed methodology is not particularly innovative, and it acts in a controlled scenario: the method is a CNN developed to work in a (virtual) setup that requires several prior knowledge: the view (also, it need to be trained for every different one), the pose parameters (making it also dependent on the animation system), the garment, the texture, and the light condition. Finally, the shown examples and experiments are limited to a few setups, without stressing the limits of the method.\nI am wondering how does the method performs training a different kind of garments with higher mobility (e.g. skirts) or subject to non-isometric deformations (e.g. zip clothes) or with irregular textures at higher frequencies (e.g. a shirt with a clear logo). \n- I am not surprised that the method improves the starting one, and I would suggest to compare it with others refinement baselines (e.g. PCA, or nearest neighbor in the training set). Also, the proposed subdivision step seems harmful in Table 2 (and not helpful in Sup.Mat. Table 1), and it is unexpected to me: I think would be good including a comment in the text.\n- Finally,  I understand that the focus of the paper is in a specific computer graphic domain, but while it is not the precise scope of the paper, I think would be interesting also to show the method limits when some of these priors elements are estimated for real-world cases (e.g. using pose regression techniques to infer the parameters).

The paper first trains multiple networks (each network is for one specific camera view) to predict the texture coordinates in the corresponding camera view, then recover 3D shapes from multiple camera views. \n\n**Strength**\n1. Using texture sliding as a proxy to learn 3D geometry is an interesting idea\n2. The paper also spends many efforts on designing texture sliding methods for occlusion boundary, which is hard for geometry processing. \n\n**Weakness**\n1. The paper claims to prevent overfitting induced from regularization and claim the proposed strategy can recover high-frequency details via procedurally embedded low-frequency data, however, the proposed method is specifically designed for 3D meshes (texture perturbation), it's not clear how does the method work with other machine learning representations, e.g. 2D image. At least, from my point view, this is not a trivial extension, and the paper didn't show the experiments beyond the 3D clothing mesh. I would suggest the authors turn down the claims in the paper. \n\n2. The experiments on 3D reconstruction is not well enough. The paper argues to learn the geometric details, thus a careful analysis of the reconstructed 3D geometry (especially emphasizing on the geometric details) would be more convincing. However, the paper only presented one example of the final result (Fig.12/13), it would be better to: a) show more qualitative results, b) show quantitative comparisons with more baselines, e.g. a network that directly predicts the vertex offset in the clothing mesh. c). the quantitative analysis on the geometric details, how good the method can capture the details comparing with the baselines. \n\n3. The scope of the paper is narrow. It's not trivial to extend the pipeline in the paper for a general machine learning representation. Also, in the paper, recovering 3D shapes requires post-processing and smoothing to make the shape look good.\n\n**Overall**\nOverall, Even though the idea of texture sliding is interesting, the experiments in this paper didn't demonstrate the clear improvements in recovering 3D geometric details. so I vote for a reject initially.
