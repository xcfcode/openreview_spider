While effective in tasks such as visual recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed, implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.", "pdf": "/pdf/ad43409f85e8659e1631e88d477e859ef3a4ff95.pdf", "TL;DR": "We argue for domain-agnostic data augmentation in feature space by applying simple transformations to seq2seq context vectors.", "paperhash": "devries|dataset_augmentation_in_feature_space", "keywords": ["Unsupervised Learning"], "conflicts": ["uoguelph.ca"], "authors": ["Terrance DeVries", "Graham W.
