We updated the paper based on them.\n\nThe main update is the description of (and the results on) the partially observable environment. We wanted to design the new environment to be different from the one presented while being able to perform the same set of experiments to check that our findings are general. \n\nWe decided to use another grid world with agents having same action spaces considered before. However, the new environment differs a lot. First of all, it is partially observable and just a small subgrid (5x5) around the agent is inputted to the models (both the policy and the discriminator). The map is larger and consist of four small rooms with randomly located passages between them. Hence, the agent has to explore and get to know the map to reach the goal. That makes the use of LSTM for policy necessary.\n\nDespite all these differences, the results for the new environment are coherent with the previous results and justify the importance of self-exploration. They further confirm our intuition and provide the answer which of the discriminator inputs should be used based on the relation between the expert and the learner action spaces.\n\nAlthough the experiments conducted in the first version of the paper show the main properties of the proposed algorithm, we agree that the extra experiments added in the new version are important since the methods should generalise to different problems. We hope that the new set of experiments address the main concerns of the reviewers. Additionally, we have cleaned our source code that will be released upon acceptance, so our results are easily reproducible.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1212/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1212/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1212/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reinforced Imitation Learning from Observations", "abstract": "Imitation learning is an effective alternative approach to learn a policy when the reward function is sparse.

To do so, the authors modify the GAIL algorithm and create a composite reward function as a linear combination of the extrinsic reward and the imitation reward. They test their approach on several toy problems (small grid worlds). \n\nThe idea of combining GAIL reward and extrinsic reward is not really new and quite straight forward so I wouldn't consider this as a contribution. Also, using state only demonstration in the framework of GAIL is not new as the authors also acknowledge in the paper. Finally, I don't think the experiments are convincing since the chosen problems are rather simple. \n\nBut my main concern is that the major claim of the authors is that they don't use expert actions as input to their algorithm, but only sequences of states. Yet they test their algorithm on deterministic environments. In such a case, two consecutive states kind of encode the action and all the information is there. Even if the action sets are different in some of the experiments, they are still very close to each other and the encoding of the expert actions in the state sequence is probably helping a lot. So I would like to see how this method works in stochastic environments.

Our method, in contrary to previously presented, does not limit the learner to use the same actions as used in expert demonstrations. As shown in our experiments, we were able to successfully train our agent even when action spaces are disjoint. Considering your specific example (with 8-way-king learner and 4-way expert), we already have a short comment on that in the paper -- the learner on average gets to the goal quicker (in respect to number of steps), hence it uses \u201cnew\u201d actions. We believe that it is important remark and we will edit paper to make this more clear and visible.\nWe did not have any experiments supporting the hypothesis of being immune to domain shift in our setup. That\u2019s a very interesting direction, but we believe it is general question for all GAN-based methods and should be a part of another work. However, we would be glad to explore this in future research.\nI believe that our idea will work in any setup but it is well-suited for cases when expert and learner have different action spaces. The Atari games are created in a such way that all buttons (actions) are important and usually necessary to perform well. However, we started experimenting on complex environment, Vizdoom (3D POMPD), where the agent is still able to perform well using just a subset of all possible actions. Preliminary results lead to the similar conclusions, but we need more time to make any statement in this setting.\nWe have not shown GAIL for comparison in Fig 3. and Fig. 4 because the straightforward application of GAIL method is possible only when learner action space is a subset of expert action space which is rarely case in our experiments.\nThanks you again for providing related work and all minor remarks.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic experiments studying state-only demonstrations have been done. We propose baseline methods that are straightforward implication of previous works and we compare them to our methods (RTGD, ATD, self-exploration). We show quantitatively how all methods presented perform in different situations.\n\nWe agree to the fact that in deterministic environments the consecutive states encode the action performed. The choice of deterministic environment was made on purpose. We believe that this choice makes the problem more challenging because discriminator is more likely to \u2018decode\u2019 action spaces used by two agents and easily discriminate based on that -- which leads to providing non-informative rewards (rewards that are not linked with the policy).\nThis intuition is confirmed in the paper: CSD performs bad when action spaces are disjoint. We report results for methods that can not decode actions (RTGD, ATD and SSD) and they perform better than CSD (unless action states are not disjoint, then all methods perform similar). We will modify the paper to make this more clear.\n\nAlthough the experiments show the main properties of the proposed algorithm, we also agree that more experiments on different tasks would definitely be helpful.\nWe explored the method in another gridworld setting, in which the agent does not have access to the whole map, but only partial observations (we use a 5x5 subgrid surrounding the agent). We used the same action spaces for both expert and learner to be able to compare the result directly. Results in the POMDP setting are very similar to the fully-observed setting.\nWe started experimenting on more complex environment, Vizdoom (3D POMPD). This environment is much more (computationally) demanding, so conducting systematic experiment set (as done for the original problem) is more challenging. Preliminary results lead to the similar conclusions, but we need more time to make any statement in this setting.\nVizdoom environment dynamic implements inertia and hence the previous action cannot be inferred from consecutive states. Also the behavior of another agents (bots) is non-deterministic.\n\nWe would appreciate any suggestions on the experimental setting that could improve our work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1212/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1212/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1212/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reinforced Imitation Learning from Observations", "abstract": "Imitation learning is an effective alternative approach to learn a policy when the reward function is sparse.

Can you comment if GAN-based methods are immune or susceptible to this?\n   \n- Would this work for tasks where the state-space has to be learned together with the policy? E.g. image captioning tasks or Atari games.\n\n- Is it possible to quantify the ease of learning or the frequency of use of the \"new\" actions, i.e. $A^l \\setminus A^e$?. Won't learning these actions effectively be as difficult as RL with sparse rewards? Say, in a grid world where 4-way diagonal moves allow reaching the goal faster, learner is king 8-way, demonstrations come from a 4-way expert, rewards are sparse and each step receives a -1 reward and the final goal is large positive -- does the learner's final policy actually use the diagonals and when?\n\nRelated work:\n   \n- Is it possible to make a connection to (data or policy) aggregation methods in IL.
