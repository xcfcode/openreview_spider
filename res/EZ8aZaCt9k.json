For  a general setup, the paper shows that if the network width is greater than $2m(n+1)^l$, then any parameter value has a path to a global minimum on which the training loss does not increase. Here, $m$ is the output dimension, $n$ is the number of training examples, and $l$ is the number of hidden layers.\n\nStrength\n\nThe result presented in the paper holds for a surprisingly wide range of setups. The theorem holds for any convex loss function, any arbitrary activation, arbitrary output dimension and depth. The theorem holds for unconstrained optimization setup, and also some specific type of constrained setup (Eq (3)).\n\nThe paper is well-written and it delivers its key messages fairly well. The main text provides a good proof sketch that is easy to follow. After a quick perusal of the proof I am convinced that the proof is correct. Overall, I enjoyed reading this paper.\n\nWeakness\n\nThere are two main weaknesses of this paper: one is the huge width requirement that exponentially grows with depth, the other is too many missing (directly relevant) citations and the unconventional usage of the term \u201cspurious local minima\u201d.\n\nLet me start with the second one. There is a large body of literature that refers to non-optimal local minima as spurious/bad local minima, and investigates existence/nonexistence of such local minima in the context of neural networks [1, 2, 3, 4, and many more]. In fact, for deep networks with piecewise linear activations, no matter how wide the network is, it is known that there are non-optimal local minima in the training loss in the unconstrained case [3, 4]. The paper misses the entire body of literature and defines spurious local minima in a different way, which can confuse the readers. The title already sounds like a contradiction to [3, 4]!\n\nMore importantly, there are also other missing citations that are even more directly relevant, namely, the ones studying nonincreasing paths to global minima [5, 6, 7]. This set of results typically require that one of the hidden layers is wider than the number of data points $n$ and that the subsequent layers after the wide hidden layer only get narrower. Although these results hold for more specific setups than this paper, the difference in the width requirement is huge: $n$ vs $O(n^l)$.\n\nIn light of these existing results, I fear that the width requirement in this paper is too big, and it grows exponentially with the depth $l$. Although I liked the construction illustrated in this paper, this significant weakness of the main result makes me hesitate to recommend acceptance.\n\nOne minor weakness I also wanted to point out was that, \u201cnonincreasing path to global minimum\u201d alone is not enough, in the sense that this property does not rule out the existence of a local minimum in a locally constant region of the loss landscape (think of the case where all the ReLUs are turned off in a ReLU network). Although sufficient width can ensure the existence of a nonincreasing path to a global minimum from this locally constant region, there is no way that a gradient-based local search algorithm can escape this region.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nAlthough I liked this paper as I read it, I believe the weaknesses of the main result are too significant. I also think that the paper could use a rewriting to contextualize the results relative to the missing citations. I lean slightly towards rejection at this time.\n\n\n[1] Kenji Kawaguchi.

The theory combines the features of the two mentioned works, as it applies to the entire optimization landscapes, allows for a wide spectrum of loss functions and activation functions, and constraint and unconstraint estimation. The proof defines two important concepts: path relation and block parameters and utilizes these two concepts and propositions and lemmas developed upon them to prove the main result. \n\n\nThe major concern of this work is that the setting is far from practice. In other words, the theory cannot provide much practical guidance nor insights for improvement.\n\n1. First of all, the network width, $w >= 2m(n+1)^l$, is too large to be practical. Since $n$, the number of training examples, and $l$, the number of layers of a network, are large most of the times in the field today, the theorem is not very practical and not applicable in real networks.\n\n2. Second, from the work of Zhang et al. \"Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization\u201d, we know that finding the global optimal solution for the training loss of overparameterized networks does not imply good generalization.  Therefore, it is not very meaningful to find the global solutions, since the network is highly overparameterized and not every global solution generalizes the same.\n\n3. Third, the result is far from practice in deep network training. In practice, people, in general, believe that there are spurious local minimizers in deep networks (see Itay et al. \u201cSpurious local minima are common in two-layer relu neural networks\u201d, \u201cVisualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets\u201d), but the data has structures and the deep network is enforcing implicit regularizations to avoid those bad local minimizers.

The main contribution of this paper is the result that shows the empirical risk of very wide networks has no *spurious local minima*. The results hold for both constrained (like the norm or sparsity constraints on the network parameters) or unconstrained risks, but require the network width larger than $O(mn^\\ell)$, where $m$ is the output dimension, $n$ is the number of training samples, and $\\ell$ is the number of layers.\n\n[Pros] This paper provides interesting results on the optimization landscape of deep learning. These results could provide a better understanding of the training problems in deep learning and why the neural networks can be successfully trained by local search algorithms like SGD.\n\n[Cons] 1. My first major comment is about the definition of *spurious local minima* used in this paper. People usually say a local minimum as a spurious local minimum if it is not a global minimum, and hence say a function has no spurious local minima if every local minimum is global. This is different from what has been used in this paper (Definition 1), which only counts a subset of local minima and excludes other local minima that are also not global. For example, see the local minima in Figure 1.a in [A]. \n\n[A] On the Benefit of Width for Neural Networks: Disappearance of Basins (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11039)\n\n2. Indeed, I feel like the definition of *spurious local minima* used in this paper is similar to the so-called *set-wise strict local minimum* in the above-mentioned reference [A]. [A] provides similar results but is missing. The authors should compare the results with [A]. In particular, [A] also proves the empirical risk of networks has no spurious *set-wise strict local minimum* in the sense that every set-wise strict local minimum contains a global minimum, but only requires the width of the last hidden layer larger than $n$.\n\n3. The results require a huge-width network, i.e., the network width larger than $O(mn^\\ell)$. In this case, it is known that the network acts as a kernel method (also known as \"lazy training\") and many results have shown simple gradient descent converges to a global minimum. So in this sense, the result that the training problem in this regime has a nice optimization landscape is not that surprising.

The \"No spurious local minima\" claim holds for all depth and quite general activation function. This greatly extends previous result and understanding.\n2. The proof is heavily based on a new concept \"path equivalence\" and the algebraic manipulation. It is nontrivial and different from previous techniques. I checked part of the proof, which are correct to me.\n\nWeak points:\n1. The paper is hard to read for the various calligraphic notations. Although there are some description of the proof, it is better to give more intuitive argument before going to details.\n2. The result requires extremely width O(n^l), under this regime each sample is guaranteed to be separable. This requirement is even larger than the NTK regime under which the gradient descent is guaranteed to find global minima. Thus it is doubtable of the theoretical/practical value of the work: use an even larger width and describe an optimization landscape that is not related with optimization methods.\n\nDespite of the above weakness, I will recommend its acceptance to foster diverse techniques.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper345/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper345/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "No Spurious Local Minima: on the Optimization Landscapes of Wide and Deep Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~Johannes_Lederer1"], "authors": ["Johannes Lederer"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Empirical studies suggest that wide neural networks are comparably easy to optimize, but mathematical support for this observation is scarce.
