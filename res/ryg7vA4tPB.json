One of these preferences is for \"papers with a theoretical basis over papers which are mostly experimental\".  There may be others.  Submitters are not told in advance of these preferences, but may have their submission rejected because of them.  That does not sound like a system in which I want to participate.  I hope that future versions of ICLR either make all such preferences explicit, or that unwritten preferences are not used as reasons for rejection.\n\nI also note that Review 1 stopped responding after we provided all the comparisons and additional datasets that they asked for (with the results in favor of our method), despite saying \"I temporarily provide the rating of weak reject. I may change my opinion if the authors provide those results during the rebuttal period.\"  This is precisely the situation where I would hope the AC might intervene beyond looking at raw aggregate scores, especially since the score 6-6-3 places the paper on the borderline.\n\nI also note the following quotes, while also noting that quotes from reviews are not enough justification for a decision one way or the other:\n\"Overall, I found the paper to be very clear and of high quality, and thus I find this to be an interest addition to investigations into the lottery ticket hypothesis.\"\n\"Overall, this is a nice paper that should be accepted to ICLR.\"\n\nI hope the AC learns from this experience and does a more thorough job if tasked with similar responsibilities in the future.\n\nRegards,\nErich Elsen"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.

This achieves an error rate of 1.6% in 200 epochs. The total FLOPs done during training are 583 GFLOPs.  We note that we need far fewer than 200 epochs to reach this error rate, but we leave training length as 200 to avoid a confounding factor when comparing to the other methods which reports results at 200 epochs.\n\nThe hyperparameters we use are:\n\nOptimizer: nesterov momentum, lr=0.2, momentum=0.9\nBatch size: 100\nL2 decay: 1e-4\nMaskupdate_begin_step: 0\nMaskupdate_end_step: 40000\nMaskupdate_frequency: 200\nDrop_fraction: 0.2\n\nSBP and VIB must do, as a lower bound, as much work as training the dense network.  This requires 13,521 GFLOPs.  For L0, as a generous lower bound, we assume the original network size for the first 10 epochs and the final network size for the remaining 190 epochs, this requires 1,964 GFLOPs.\n\nThis means that RigL does significantly less work than any of these approaches when starting from the original 784-300-100-10 network.\n\n(RigL-160) We also train the smaller network found by SBP 784-160-55-10 with RigL with 96% sparsity in the first layer and 90% of that (or 86.4%) in the second layer. This achieves an error rate of 1.7% in 200 epochs (again far more than necessary). The total FLOPS done during training are 397 GFLOPs.\n\nThe hyperparameters we use are:\n\nOptimizer: nesterov momentum, lr=0.2, momentum=0.9\nBatch size: 100\nL2 decay: 1e-4\nMaskupdate_begin_step: 0\nMaskupdate_end_step: 70000\nMaskupdate_frequency: 100\nDrop_fraction: 0.2\n\nTraining the SBP network of 245-160-55-10 from scratch would require 2,554 GFLOPs (SBP-S). Training the L0 network of 266-88-33 would require 1,356 GFLOPs (L0-S).  Training the VIB network 97-71-33-10 would require 523 GFLOPs (VIB-S).\n\nEven on the networks found through bayesian architecture search, RigL still requires fewer flops to achieve an equivalent error rate.  This demonstrates the orthogonality of these approaches.\n\nThe inference cost of each network is:\n\nRigL-Large: 18.5 MFlops\nRigL-Small: 13.5 MFlops\nL0: 53.2 MFlops\nSBP: 97.1 MFlops\nVIB: 19.12 MFlops\n\nIn short, RigL requires _far_ fewer FLOPs when starting from a larger architecture and still requires 1.5-7x fewer flops when starting from an optimized architecture and the architectures it finds require fewer flops than the bayesian approaches.  RigL can still find more efficient architectures when starting from an architecture that has been found by the bayesian approaches.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n- SBP, Structured Bayesian Pruning via Log-Normal Multiplicative Noise, https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07283\n- VIB, Compressing Neural Networks using the Variational\nInformation Bottleneck, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10399.pdf\n- L0, LEARNING SPARSE NEURAL NETWORKS\nTHROUGH L0 REGULARIZATION, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01312.pdf "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.

The number of neurons and connections are *fixed* throughout training - RigL does NOT increase network capacity during training. Since the reviewer has made this claim multiple times, we would like to briefly summarize our method (Section-3 of our paper) below to make sure there is no confusion:\n\n(RigL) takes a predefined architecture (i.e. Resnet-50) and randomly sparsifies its *connections* (not neurons). Training is done on this sparse network. Every T steps we change the connectivity of each layer by dropping least magnitude connections and activating the ones that have the highest expected gradient. Note that the number of deactivated connections are same as the activated ones; therefore total number of connections *doesn't grow or change*: resource requirements are fixed throughout the training. This general idea of training sparse networks with dynamic connectivity is done in earlier work (see SET, SNFS, DSR references in our paper) and it is not the novelty of our work. The novelty of our work lies in using the instantaneous gradient information to select which connections to activate.\n\n------------Experiments with DEN---------\nWe checked the DEN-repo carefully. The code includes only a permuted-MNIST training setup which is only mentioned in the appendix of the paper, all the experiments from the main text are missing. Since there is no information on which hyper parameters used, we used the default values. There is also no option for running DEN-finetune experiments; therefore we added this capability. We ran the following experiments:\n(1a) Default training. The initial network starts with 31.14% sparsity and 784-312-128-10 units. The network obtained after 10 permuted MNIST task is 784-384-199-10 and has an overall sparsity of 0.1416. We finetuned the resulting model for 20 epochs (3 different runs). The total FLOPS needed during training is roughly 28,200 GFLOPs (Detailed calculation below).\n(1b) We trained the same architecture(784-384-199-10) from a random initial point for 20 epochs (Scratch) and 70 epochs (Scratch+). \n(1c) We randomly sparsified the first (95%) and second layer(85.5%) of the architecture found by (1a) and trained the architecture using RigL for 70 epochs. We set inital_drop_fraction=0.2, end_step=5e4, update_interval=200 and drop_fraction_annel=cosine.\n(2a) We also tried starting DEN training from a much smaller network of 784-100-50-10. This network started with a sparsity of 0.27 and grew into the final architecture of size 784-175-111-10 with an average sparsity 0.0893. After the continual learning setup, the network is finetuned for 20 epochs and the total FLOPs needed during training is approximately 9,920 GFLOPs. \n(2b) Similarly we trained the resulting architectures from scratch.

We hope that the reviewer can agree that in this case,  we can say for certain without even running SBP and VIB that they will do at least as much work during training as pruning*.  That is they will fall on or to the _right_ of the pruning in all of the plots.  Given this we don't think it makes sense to dedicate such limited resources to these experiments.\n\n*For example, SBP mentions \"At the start of the training procedure, we use pre-trained weights for initialization.\" meaning that the cost of SBP will be to the _right_ of the pruning line since it must include the cost of pre-training.\n\nL0 might do slightly less work than pruning, but given the data from their paper (approximately 7% less), it does not seem like a significant enough difference, as the results presented in our paper do 75-95% less work.\n\nAdditionally, we believe one key difference between those techniques and ours is that they will never be able to train a larger network than the largest dense network we can currently train (and in fact it will be smaller, since they introduce memory overheads).\n\nWe also note that we have experiments on MobileNet_v2 which is significantly less overparameterized relative to the networks used in those papers.  For example, SBP finds a VGG network with ~1M parameters that matches the original dense performance on CIFAR-10.  Our 75% sparse mobilenet_v2 ERK network needs fewer than 1M parameters to solve a much more difficult problem (ImageNet).\n\nFinally, we disagree with the nomenclature that \"SBP, VIB and L0 (when applied to neurons)\" are sparsification approaches.  They start with dense networks, train dense and result in a dense network that can be trained from scratch.  They are an architecture search over channel counts.  We will consider examining how architectures found with these techniques behave when trained with RigL in future work."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.

The sparse initialization makes the pruning algorithm to be memory- and computation- efficient, unlike existing models that starts with dense network weights. The authors train RigL with three different sparsity distributions that considers the number of input and output nodes, and validate them on various deep convnets for training on ImageNet, on which the model outperforms several existing sparsification methods and even dense counterparts. \n\nPros\n- The proposed model, RigL, is memory- and computation- efficient, and thus allows to train a large network in an efficient manner.\n \n- RigL obtains impressive sparsification performance, even yielding sparse networks that outperform their dense counterparts.\n\nCons\n- The idea of starting from a small, sparse network and expanding it is not novel. DEN [Yoon et al. 18] proposed the same bottom-up approach with sparsely initialized networks, while they allowed to increase the number of neurons at each layer and focused more on continual learning. The authors should compare the two methods both conceptually and experimentally. \n\n- The method is more like a set of heuristics rather than a principled approach, which makes it less appealing. This is not really an issue if the paper includes extensive experimental validation and in-depth analysis, but this is not the case. \n \n- The experimental validation is largely lacking, as the authors only perform experiments on ImageNet and do not compare against recent state-of-the-art Bayesian sparsification methods (SBP, VIB, L0-regularization). Without such extensive experimental validation, it is uncertain whether the result will generalize, given the highly empirical nature of the work. \n\nIn sum, although I believe that the paper proposes a very practical method that is easy to implement and is promising, due to lack of experimental validation against a similar approach, state-of-the-art sparsification methods, and results on more datasets, I temporarily provide the rating of weak reject. I may change my opinion if the authors provide those results during the rebuttal period.\n\n[Yoon et al. 18] Lifelong learning with dynamically expandable networks, ICLR 2018", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.

However, there are some important differences between our work and DEN:\n  (a) As emphasized in its abstract and in the introduction DEN attacks the problem of catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning setting and grows new neurons during training to efficiently learn each task in sequence. In contrast, we fix the number of available neurons in each layer and focus on sparse training of neural networks for a single task.  In theory we could compare the cost of training with these two different approaches, however:\n  (b) When extending continual learning (as used by DEN) to the split dataset regime it is non-trivial to match the performance of a standard training regime (as used by RigL).  For example, see http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wu_Large_Scale_Incremental_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf .  We are not aware of work that is able to do this successfully, and would appreciate references so that we can possibly make a proper comparison.\n\n(2) We have added two new datasets and architectures to address concerns about the lack of experimental validation. We pushed some of the analysis to the Appendix due to length constraints. We would like to point out Appendix B (Effect of Sparsity Distribution on Other Methods) , C (Effect of Momentum Coefficient for SNFS), D (Existence of Lottery Tickets), E (Effect of Update Schedules), F (Alternative Update Schedules) and H (Additional Plots and Experiments for CIFAR-10) for extended analysis of our results. We have an explanation based on a Taylor series approximation why magnitude pruning and largest gradient growth is optimal (at least greedily) in Appendix F (now Appendix A). Unfortunately we had originally forgotten to mention this in the main text, but we have now updated the last paragraph of Section 4 with a short discussion and a pointer to the appendix.\n \n(3) Regarding SBP (we assume you mean \u201cStructured Bayesian Pruning\u201d https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07283), VIB (assuming \u201cVariational Information Bottleneck\u201d https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10399.pdf), and L0-regularization (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01312.pdf) - we note that these techniques function as an architecture search over channel count distributions and are somewhat orthogonal to our own work. SBP and VIB do _at least_ as much work during training as training the large model they start with (often quite a bit more as there are non-trivial overheads associated with these techniques).  The resulting architectures can be trained from scratch (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05270).  Once these techniques find an improved architecture it could be trained with _weight_ sparsity using our technique.\n\n  L0 does slightly reduce the cost during training, but the difference is not very large.  According to Figure 4 of their paper, the cost is decreased from ~3.5 to 3.25 (e11) flops by the end of training, or a reduction of 7%.  The total decrease over the course of training would be even less.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.

Given N anchor points, the Bezier curves are capable of representing a more general path than the other technique we are aware of for connecting minima (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/draxler18a/draxler18a.pdf).

In order to break the limits of the size of the largest trainable sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model, the author proposes a dynamic method that updates the network topology via parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculation. In the experiments parts, they conduct extensive studies to show the proposed approach can surpass the previous sota with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and v2 on the imagenet 2012. What's more, the author also provides some intuitive explanation about why allowing topology change during the optimization is beneficial. \n\nStrength Bullets:\n\n1. Due to the dynamic network topology, the paper's methods exactly achieve the memory and computation efficient. i) Required memory is only proportional to the size of the sparse model. ii) The amount of computation is proportional to the number of nonzero parameters in the model.\n2. The author performs detailed comparison experiments among different sparsity distribution and different pruning methods. And the results overcome the previous state-of-the-art results.\n3. Fig 5 shows some interesting insight. It suggests that static sparse training may be stuck at some local minima which are isolated from improved solutions. However, the dynamic update has a big chance to avoid this problem.\n\nWeakness Bullets:\n\n1. The author claims that the ticket in the paper does not rely on a \"lucky\" initialization. But it doesn't exclude the possibility that starting from the original initial conditions may give a better performance. Even if the connection is dynamic, we can still record the initial point for each weight. It will be better the author can provide related analysis.\n2. In my opinion, in order to prove dynamic pruning is better than static methods, the author needs to provide a comparison with the previous sota method in it's own setting. i.e. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI think this paper is a novel work. Although it has some flaws in the experiment design, the motivation and experiment results are conniving enough. So, this is a weak accept."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.

The method involves a combination of dynamic pruning of weights coupled with a dynamic \"growing\" of new weights given a novel criterion based on the magnitude of the gradient of the loss. As a result, networks can stay sparse throughout training and testing, leading to a large reduction in computational cost.\n\nThe paper's approach of dynamically changing the topology of networks is an interesting and motivated idea that seems to work rather well. I also appreciate the experiments on MobileNet, a setting where one expects investigations into sparse network architectures to have significant application. Relatedly, I appreciate the importance of the fact that the computational cost of training and evaluating the network is proportional to the sparse model size, which is not normally true for masked dense models. Overall, I found the paper to be very clear and of high quality, and thus I find this to be an interest addition to investigations into the lottery ticket hypothesis.\n\nAs the authors state, the novelty of their method is that they use the gradients with the highest magnitudes to grow connections. This is somewhat intuitive given the role gradients play in gradient descent based optimization, but I was wondering if they had any further intuition as to why this is the right criterion?\n\nIn section 4.3, I was a bit confused by Figure 5. My understanding is that many paths between loss landscape minima follow nonlinear paths -- why is it at all significant that there's a linear barrier? Why are only quadric and cubic Bezier curves used, rather than a more general path finding algorithm?\n\nOverall, this is a nice paper that should be accepted to ICLR."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1169/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ue225@nyu.edu", "eriche@google.com", "tgale@google.com", "psc@google.com"], "title": "Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners", "authors": ["Utku Evci", "Erich Elsen", "Pablo Castro", "Trevor Gale"], "pdf": "/pdf/ff9c4f7d184a224e903a9b7a10be1ad832f1383f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results with ResNet-50, MobileNet v1 and MobileNet v2 on the ImageNet-2012 dataset.", "abstract": "Sparse neural networks have been shown to yield computationally efficient networks with improved inference times.
