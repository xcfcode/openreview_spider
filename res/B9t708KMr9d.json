Here we would like to provide more discussions on the comparison between our model with other unified network structures.\n\n**Q1: About the insight/motivation of UniMP.**\n\nA1: The most important motivation of our work is that labels of the neighborhood are vital information in graph neural network settings.\n\nIn the traditional machine learning scenarios, where predictions for instances are independent, labels in the training sets can't be used during testing. However, in graph neural network settings, unlabeled nodes in the testing phase are still connected with the labeled one in training sets. Therefore, it gives a chance to utilize the training label to predict those unlabeled ones. And we can see a rising trend of graph neural network communities trying to find a better way to utilize label information in their models[A][B][C][D].\n\nHowever, Table 1 has pointed out that the existed unified methods like APPNP[A], TPN[B], and GCN-LPA[C] are incorporating label information in a more indirect way. For example, APPNP and TPN only use the nodes feature $X$ as input, predicts a soft label, and then propagate them. As for GCN-LPA, they take the nodes features $X$ and labels $\\hat{Y}$ as input in training test, using the training labels to regularize their GAT attention weight between nodes, while their GAT model can only use $X$ in inference. \n\nAll the above models can not propagate nodes features and labels in both training and test time, while our model first propose the masked labeled prediction method to address this issue, incorporating feature and label propagation within a message passing model. \n- The experiment in table 7 shows that our method can also be applied to improve other kinds of GNNs. \n- Moreover, our unified model can take the additional validation labels as input to further boost model's performance, while other GNNs or unified networks do not have this advantage (They just use the validation to select hyper-perparameters and early stop their training step). We also provide related experiments.\n\n  model &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| ogbn-arxiv(test)  \n  Unimp w/o Masked label prediction &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| 0.7293 \u00b1 0.0010   \n  Unimp w/ Masked label prediction (training label) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;| 0.7332 \u00b1 0.0014   \n  Unimp w/ Masked label prediction (training label + validation label) | **0.7377 \u00b1 0.0002** \n\n**Q2: Compared with GCN-LPA, the improvements in the insight/motivation aspect is not very significant.**\n\nA2: As mentioned above, GCN-LPA uses LPA to regularize GAT\u2019s attention weight of connected edges to improve their performance. It makes a serious limitation that their method can only optimize attention base GNN. However, our masked label prediction strategy can be applied in many kinds of GNNs (GCN and GAT) to improve their performance, shown in table 7. \n\n**Q3: If more parameters/weights are deployed in other baselines, could the performance be better?**\n\nA3: We show our OGBN leaderboard results in Table 4\\~6 with given models\u2019 parameters. Our model is not the largest while gaining SOTA results in three datasets.\nMoreover, the ablation studies in table 7 also demonstrate that our masked label prediction strategy can incorporate node feature $X$ and $\\hat{Y}$ in many kinds of GNNs. Therefore, we can combine any state-of-the-art GNNs with our strategy.\n\n[A] Johannes Klicpera, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Stephan Gunnemann.

Here, we would like to provide more explanations to address the reviewer\u2019s concerns.\n\n**Q1: What is the label leakage problem?**\n\nA1: As our unified model will take the node feature $X$ and partially observed label $\\hat{Y}$ as input, when being trained, the model will overfit in their self-loop node labels information, invalidating their estimated performance. More concretely, when training labels are considered as model inputs, the model will tend to just simply copy the input labels and learn nothing about the relation between nodes. The objective function is   $\\arg\\max_{\\theta} \\log p_{\\theta}( \\hat{Y} |  X, A, \\hat{Y})$.\n\nHowever, in testing time, those unlabeled nodes only take their nodes features as input, using the neighborhood labels and nodes to make predictions as $p( Y_{unlabeled} |  X, A, \\hat{Y})  $. It will be lead to poor performance.\n\nTo avoid the above label leakage problem, we propose a masked label prediction (MLP) strategy to train our model. During training, we corrupt the $\\hat{Y}$ into $\\tilde{Y}$ by randomly masking a portion of node labels to zeros and keep the others remain. Let those masked labels be $\\bar{Y}$, our new objective function is to predict $\\bar{Y}$ with given $X$, $\\tilde{Y}$ and $A$. The formula can be rewritten as $\\arg\\max_{\\theta}  \\log p_{\\theta}(\\bar{Y}| X,\\tilde{Y}, A)$ with $\\hat{Y} =  [\\bar{Y}; \\tilde{Y}]$.\n\nHere, we extend the ablation studies in ogbn-arxiv to support this.\n\nModel  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| train | valid | test  \nUniMP ($A, X$) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| 0.8070 | 0.7414 | 0.7292  \nUniMP ($A, X, \\hat{Y}$) w/ MLP &nbsp;| 0.8116 | **0.7462** | **0.7332**  \nUniMP ($A, X, \\hat{Y}$) w/o MLP|  **0.9999** | 0.6169 | 0.6084  \n\nUniMP without MLP strategy can easily get nearly 100\\% training accuracy but poor validation score and test score, which is the consequence of label leakage. Without MLP strategy, labels will do more harm than good to our models. In table 7, by default, we have used MLP strategy to train the model with $A, \\hat{Y}$ and $A, X, \\hat{Y}$.\n\n**Q2:  Experimental results are not consistent, c.f. Table 4\\~6 and Table 7. Standalone Transformer even surpasses UniMP.**\n\nA2: Table 4\\~6 is the submitted result for OGB leaderboard which is actually graph Transformer + MLP strategy. And it has the same architecture with row 10 table 7 with ($A, X, \\hat{Y}$) as input. We can find that UniMP (Transformer + $A, X, \\hat{Y}$ inputs + MLP) outperforms Transformer + ($A, X$) inputs.\n\nSince the numerical scores are slightly different between Table 4\\~6 and Table 7, we want to make more clarifications:\n-  In Table 7, all the experiments are conducted 3 times, while the scores in Table 4~6 are reported as 10 times average following the rules of OGB leaderboard. \n- For ogbn-proteins in Table 7, we average the edge features as nodes features and drop edge features, for making a fair comparison between our model and others, because vanilla GCN and GAT are incapable of handling edge features. Therefore, without edge features, the UniMP of ogbn-proteins in Table 7 has a lower score than that in Table 5. \n- The above clarifications can be found in the footnote of Table 7.\n\n**Q3: About the hyper-parameter specifications**\n\nA3: We get the initial hyper-parameter from other baseline models [A][B] from the leaderboard, without over tuning it on the datasets. The tuned hyper-parameters can be found in Appendix B.\n\n**Q4: About the difference compared with GAT and whether adopting gated residual connections.**\n\nA4: We provide more ablation studies in ogbn-arxiv to make comparisons from the following 3 aspects: (1) Vanilla transformer (dot-product) and GAT (sum attention); (2) w/ and w/o residual; (3) residual and gated residual.\n\nModel &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u2502Transformer&emsp;&nbsp;|&emsp;GAT  \nogb-arxiv dataset | valid | test &emsp;&emsp;| valid | test  \nw/o residual &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;| 0.7402 | 0.7293 | 0.7405 | 0.7278  \nw/ residual &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;| 0.7444 | 0.7311 | 0.7444 |0.7297  \nw/ gated residual | 0.7462 | **0.7332** | 0.7435 | 0.7295  \n\nWe can find that dot-product attention can outperform sum attention. And gated residual can surpasses the one w or w/o simple residual in Transformer. \n\nMoreover, followed the official implement [A] in the leaderboard, GAT for ogb-product and ogb-proteins in Table 7 have been with residual connection.\n\nModel &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\u2502 ogbn-product (test) |  ogbn-porteins (test)  \nGAT + residual&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| 0.8193 &emsp;| &emsp;0.8556  \ntransformer + gated residual &emsp;| **0.8269** &emsp;| &emsp;**0.8560**  \n\n[A] https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/ogbn_products_gat.py\n\n[B] https://github.com/lightaime/deep_gcns_torch/tree/master/examples/ogb\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3122/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3122/Area_Chairs", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3122/Reviewers"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3122/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Masked Label Prediction: Unified Message Passing Model for Semi-Supervised Classification", "authorids": ["shiyunsheng01@baidu.com", "huangzhengjie@baidu.com", "~shikun_feng1", "zhonghui03@baidu.com", "wangwenjin02@baidu.com", "sunyu02@baidu.com"], "authors": ["Yunsheng Shi", "Zhengjie Huang", "shikun feng", "Hui Zhong", "Wenjin Wang", "Yu Sun"], "keywords": ["Unified Message Passing Model", "Graph Neural Network", "Label Propagation Algorithm", "Semi-Supervised Classification."], "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm (LPA) are both message passing algorithms, which have achieved superior performance in semi-supervised classification.

The UniMP first employs graph Transformer networks to jointly propagate both feature and label information. Then, to avoid label leakage, a masked label prediction strategy is employed.\n\nPros:\n* The presented method shows strong empirical performance on the open graph benchmark dataset.\n* The whole framework is simple and the idea is easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n* What is the label leakage problem? It is not clear to me (1) why label will be leaked during the joint learning process and (2) what the outcome does label leakage bring.\n* The writing of this paper is poor. The authors are suggested to polish their paper. Please see minor comments below.\n* Although the proposed UniMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, the experiments are not convincing enough.\n  * Experimental results are not consistent, c.f. Table 4~6 and Table 7. It seems that the standalone Transformer even surpasses UniMP on ogbn-products and ogbn-arxiv.\n  * It seems that the hyper-parameter specifications vary greatly across the three datasets. To me the residual connection is helpful when stacking many layers (Li et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020), while in this paper the number of layers is relatively low. A sensitivity analysis on the network depth is necessary to demonstrate the impact of the residual connection.\n  * When compared with GAT, the main differences are (1) different implementations of self-attention mechanisms and (2) whether to adopt gated residual connections. However, no ablation studies are provided to demonstrate the impact of these two independent components. Especially, as shown in Table 7 and Figure 3, given $X$,$A$,$\\hat{Y}$, transformer outperforms GAT. The authors are expected to elaborate on which component (self-attention implementation or gated residual connection) brings the improvement.\n\nMinor comments:\n* Abstract: we adopt a Graph Transformer jointly [using] label embedding?\n* Abstract: UniMP ... and be empirical powerful -> is empirical powerful\n* Page 2: there are different -> they are different\n* Mathematical notations are severely abused; for example, hidden_size should be represented by $f$, and how $\\hat{Y}_e$ is transformed from $\\hat{Y}$ is not clear.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3122/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3122/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Masked Label Prediction: Unified Message Passing Model for Semi-Supervised Classification", "authorids": ["shiyunsheng01@baidu.com", "huangzhengjie@baidu.com", "~shikun_feng1", "zhonghui03@baidu.com", "wangwenjin02@baidu.com", "sunyu02@baidu.com"], "authors": ["Yunsheng Shi", "Zhengjie Huang", "shikun feng", "Hui Zhong", "Wenjin Wang", "Yu Sun"], "keywords": ["Unified Message Passing Model", "Graph Neural Network", "Label Propagation Algorithm", "Semi-Supervised Classification."], "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm (LPA) are both message passing algorithms, which have achieved superior performance in semi-supervised classification.
