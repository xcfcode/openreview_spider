The generated nodes help boost the performance in state-of-the-art classifiers (GCN and its variants). The intuition can be summarized as we want to generate fake nodes to help improve the graph convolutional network and its variants.  It is important to move from intuition to a solid body of work.\n\nRegarding to \u201ctechnical issue (1)\":\n\nMinimizing the loss function for generator considers the dependency on the existing nodes, because the mapping from latent variable z to fake node v is shaped by the existing nodes. \n\nRegarding to \u201ctechnical issue (2)\":\n\nPeople are more interested in the classification of real nodes. Based on Equation (7), the layer propagation for real nodes is constructed based on their neighbors (both real and fake nodes). Hence, the links within fake nodes cannot affect the representation of real nodes in single propagation. \n\nRegarding to \u201ctechnical issue (3)\":\n\n\u201cPull-away item\u201d prevents the fake nodes to shrink together. \u201ccomplementary loss\u201d leads the fake nodes to complementary space for existed nodes. We would add more explanations in next version. The ablation study for the loss function necessity can be found in Table 2 in page 10. \n\nRegarding to \u201cgrammar errors, typos, and hard-parsing sentences\u201d:\n\nThank you for pointing out.

The proposed framework can be easily extended to include other GNN methods. However, the novelty of the proposed model is limited, and the motivation of this paper is not strong. Also, the only motivation stated by the authors is to improve the performance on semi-supervised learning, while the improvement of the performance in the experiments is limited (i.e. ~1% improvement). The followings are the details of comments regarding this paper from three aspects.\n\n1.\tMotivation and significance are not clear.\n(1)\tThe author(s) claim(s) that combining GCN with GANs could boost the performance of semi-supervised learning, which however is not solidly validated by the experiment results. \n(2)\tThe author claims that GANs have never been applied to the SSL task in graphs. However, the existing method GraphSGAN [1] has already done this and GraphSGAN shows better scalability than GCN. The only difference between the proposed GraphCGAN and GraphSGAN is the selection of classifiers (MLP vs. GCN). Thus, the significance of the proposed GraphCGAN is not clear compared to the existing GCN and GraphSGAN. \nAs a summary, considering the limited improvement on performance, I would like to see more other motivations why we need graph-convolution-based GANs for semi-supervised learning on graphs.\n\n       [1] Ding, M., Tang, J., & Zhang, J. (2018, October). Semi-supervised learning on graphs with generative adversarial nets. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (pp. 913-922).\n\n2.\tThere are some technical issues.\n(1)\tThe generator seems very weak. As stated in Section 3.1, the generator generates each node and edge only based on randomized latent representation \u201cz\u201d. If so, each new node (and edge) is generated independently without considering the dependency on the existing nodes and the dependency between the nodes and its adjacent relations.  \n(2)\tEquation 5 is confusing. As expressed in Equation 5, the adjacent matrix of all the newly generated nodes is defined as a unit diagonal matrix I_B. It is not clear why the adjacent relation between each pair of the newly generated nodes is set to zero. \n(3)\tThe author mentions \u201cpull-away item\u201d and \u201ccomplementary loss\u201d without giving any explanations on these two items in the loss function.  An ablation study is better to be conducted to validate the necessity of these two terms in loss function.\n\n3\tThe presentation of the paper has many grammar errors, typos, and hard-parsing sentences.\n(1)\tIt is hard to parse \u201c\u2026as the map from feature vector and adjacency vector to the space of second to the last layer in convolution-based GNN...\u201d. It is not clear what \u201cthe space of second to the last layer in convolution-based GNN\u201d refers to.\n(2)\tIt is hard to parse \u201c\u2026.and extract the map to the intermediate layer g(:; :) \u2026.\u201d In Algorithm 1. The term \u201cmap\u201d is confusing. \n(3)\tIt is not clear what \"i\" refers to in the equation of L_{G_2}. If it refers to the index of one node, then there may lost a \u201csum\u201d symbol to sum up all the nodes into the loss.\n(4)\tThere are many grammar errors and typos, e.g., \n-----\u201cexisted methods\u201d\n                 -----the font of word \u201csoftmax\u201d is not unified, see Section 2.1 on Page 2.\n                 -----\u201c\u2026Later on, Dai et al. provided a theoretical\u2026.\u201d lacks the hyper-reference.\n----- \u201c: =\u201d  in Equation 4.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2790/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2790/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GraphCGAN: Convolutional Graph Neural Network with Generative Adversarial Networks", "authorids": ["~Sheng_Zhang8", "~Rui_Song2", "~Wenbin_Lu1"], "authors": ["Sheng Zhang", "Rui Song", "Wenbin Lu"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCN) achieved superior performances in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. \nGenerative adversarial networks (GAN) also show the ability to increase the performance in SSL.\nHowever, there is still no good way to combine the GAN and GCN in graph-based SSL tasks.\nIn this work, we present GraphCGAN, a novel framework to incorporate adversarial learning with convolution-based graph neural networks, to operate on graph-structured data. \nIn GraphCGAN, we show that generator can generate topology structure and features of fake nodes jointly and boost the performance of convolution-based graph neural networks classifier.\nIn a number of experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that the proposed GraphCGAN outperforms the baseline methods by a significant margin.

Summary\nThe paper presents a method to combine graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) with generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors focus on the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs and propose an end-to-end framework in which the generative model is followed by direct convolutions on the graph nodes. Experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed method, GraphCGAN is compared against several state-of-the-art approaches.\n \n##### 2. Rationale for the score\nAs stated by the authors, the proposed method is an extension of GraphSGAN. In GraphSGAN a similar process of generating fake nodes is performed. As in GraphSGAN, the fake nodes in GraphCGAN are also linked to real nodes in the graph. The difference is that in GraphSGAN a graph Laplacian regularization is done while GraphCGAN applies a convolution on the graph. This could be considered a novel change if the authors were to show that the proposed approach outperforms GraphSGAN. Yet, if there exists an increase in classification performance, it is modest at best. The accuracy and margins of error in Table 1 do not show any actual increase in performance between GraphCGAN and GraphSGAN.\n\n##### 3. Positive aspects\n- The plots included in section 5.3 are interesting and match the behavior previously reported in GraphSGAN.\n- In the analysis, the authors show how their method compares to GCN and GAT when these two are included as classifiers in the end-to-end learning process of GraphCGAN. This is a good idea and the aim is to determine if there are advantages in using the generative model. Although the idea is good, there are issues with the reported values (see section 4 of this review).\n- The authors included the code associated with the method. This is always appreciated.\n\n##### 4. Negative aspects\n- The experiments are not comprehensive and it is not clear if the authors performed the experiments from scratch. For example, the performance values reported for GAT and GCN are the same as the ones listed in Table 3 of [R1].\n- The claim that GraphCGAN outperforms GCN and GAT is not supported by all the results in Table 1. For example, the performance on Pubmed is within the margin of error for GCN. Similarly for GAT, on all three datasets.\n- When comparing against state-of-the-art methods, the authors omitted the comparison against Graph U-Nets [R1]. This is, in my opinion, the main weakness of this manuscript. If we have a look at the results obtained by Graph U-Nets (reported in Table 3 of [R1]), GraphCGAN does not seem to outperform Graph U-Nets in any dataset, including margin of errors. \n- The authors refer to an ablation study but only a couple of parameters are analyzed, e.g., number of fake nodes in Figure 1 and loss function of the generator in Table 2. The many other parameters of the model are listed in section 5.2 without details about how they were derived.\n\n##### 5. Questions to be addressed during rebuttal period\n* How does GraphCGAN compare to Graph U-Nets on the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed datasets?\n* The margin of errors are quite high, similarly to those reported for GraphSGAN. Can the authors elaborate on why this is the case?\n* Can the authors confirm on what set (hopefully a partition of the training set) were the plots in Figure 1 obtained? There is no margin of error associated to each point in the plots and it gives the impression of overfitting to the test set.\n\n##### 6.
