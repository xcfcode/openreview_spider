Actually the model in the paper is not single model, it proposed two models. One consists of \"reading\", \"writing\", \"adaptive computation\" and \" Answer module 2\", the other one is \"reading\", \"composing\", \"writing\", \"gate querying\" and \"Answer module 1\". Based on the method section and the experiment, it seems the \"adaptive computation\" model is simpler and performs better. And without two time memory update in single iteration and composing module, the model is similar to neural turing machine.\n\nComparing NSE to NTM: NTM has a single centralized controller, which is usually an MLP or RNN while NSE takes a modular approach. The main controller in NSE is decomposed into three separate modules, each of which performs for read, compose or write operation. In NSE, the compose module is introduced in addition to the standard memory update operations (i.e. read-write) in order to process the memory entries and input information.\n\nThe main advantage of NSE is in its memory update. The NTM controller does not have mechanism to avoid information collision in the memory. Particularly the NTM controller emits two separate set of access weights (i.e. read weight and erase and write weights) that do not explicitly encode the knowledge about where information is read from and written to. Moreover NTM has a fixed-size memory with no memory allocation or de-allocation protocol. Therefore unless the controller is intelligent enough to track the previous read/write information, which is hard for an RNN when processing long sequences, the memory content is overlapped and information is overwritten throughout different time scales. We think that this is a potential reason that makes NTM hard to train and makes the training not stable. We also note that the effectiveness of the location based addressing introduced in NTM is unclear. \n\nIn NSE, we introduce a systematic memory update approach based on the soft attention mechanism. NSE writes new information to the most recently read memory locations. This is accomplished by sharing the same memory key vector between the read and write modules. The NSE memory update is scalable and potentially more robust to train. NSE is provided with a variable sized memory and thus unlike NTM, the size of the NSE memory is more relaxed. The novel memory update mechanism and the variable sized memory together prevent NSE from the information collision issue and avoid the need of the memory allocation and de-allocation protocols.\nEach memory location of the NSE memory stores a token representation in input sequence during encoding. This provides NSE with an anytime-access to the entire input sequence including the tokens from the future time scales, which is not permitted in NTM, RNN and attention-based encoders.\n \n2. What is the MLP setting in the composing module?\n\nWe used a single layer MLP with 436 hidden units and ReLU activation for the composition module.\n\n3. This paper tested different size of hidden state:[256, 368, 436, 512], I do not find any relation between those numbers, how could you find 436? Is there any tricks helping you find those numbers?\n\nIt is usually not trivial to find those hyper-parameter settings as the search space is huge. Grid search is preferred for small tasks that we can afford multiple runs. For the large scale tasks like ones addressed in this paper, we turn to a random search or rely on previous experiences. Those hidden state sizes mainly came from the previous work, except 436. 436 was selected by a random search and it worked better than 256, 368 and 512 that were taken from the related work. \n\n4. It needs more ablation study about using different T such as T=1,2.. 5. According to my understanding, for the adaptive computation, it would stop when the P_T <0. So what is the distribution of T in the testing data?\n\nFor the given time and resource, we were able to conduct an additional experiment with 12 different runs with T=1,2. In the updated manuscript we also discussed about using different T, maximum number of permitted steps. In general given a small number of permitted steps, we found that our models less likely overfit although the final performance is not high. As the number of permitted steps increases both dev and test accuracy improves yielding an overall higher performance. However, this holds up to a certain point. When the permitted steps are large, we no longer observe a significant performance improvement in terms of testing accuracy. For example, NSE Query Gating model with T=15  achieved 79.2% dev accuracy and 71.4% test accuracy on CBT-NE task, showing the highest accuracy on the dev set yet massively overfitting on the test set. Furthermore it becomes expensive to train a model with a large number of allowed steps.\n\nDuring the qualitative analysis, we found out that the distribution of T is mostly concentrated at 2. This is also indicated in the query regression visualizations in Appendix A. As noted in the manuscript, our adaptive computation model adjusts T for a particular task (i.e document and question pair). More recently and following our work, the adaptive computation framework was successfully adapted for image classification and object recognition tasks [1]. Particularly the adaptive computation framework was deployed within residual networks to decide when to halt the computation.\n\nFinally for the CNN news task, we ran our NSE adaptive model without any hyper-parameter tuning.  It achieved ~74% accuracy (74%~75%) on the CNN test set. The result is not included in our paper as we speculate that the results could be improved further if we have more time. We think that ~74% accuracy is reasonable considering the fact that the human performance on the task is ~75%.\n\n\nRef:\n1.

Here we address the reviewer's questions below:\n\n> what is the relationship between eqn 10 and eqn 13? Is 13 an alternatively way of updating the query? Where is z_t in the query gating approach?\nFor the query gating model, the memory is updated twice per step by applying both eqn 10 and 13 sequentially whereas for the adaptive computation model the memory is updated only once with eqn 10. The first update rule defined by eqn 10 involves the information s^d_t retrieved from the document and the memory key z_t. The second update rule of eqn 13 performs gating of the old query information M^q_{t-1} to the current time step. Through this memory gating operation, the write module locks the query content or rolls back the new query updates to prevent the model from forgetting useful information or from making overconfident updates. We showed the effectiveness of the memory gating operation in the query regression visualization of Appendix A.\n\n>For the adaptive computation approach, do you stop based on sampling from the normalized stopping score? Is this stopping decision supervised (it doesn't seem to be)? \nFor the adaptive computation approach, the write module outputs a halting score ranging from 0 to 1 through its termination head in every step. As the  hypothesis-testing loop proceeds, the scores computed in the previous steps are summed up and once this sum exceeds 1, the model halts the loop and outputs the final answer for a particular query. This stopping decision is not explicitly/directly supervised. The halting score is rather incorporated in the loss function as in eqn 19 for training. \n\nIn our approach, no supervision is provided until the models halt the reasoning process, giving the models a freedom to form varying hypotheses. Only a high level supervision to whether the prediction is true or not is given once the models halt the loop. In order to reason about input, the models make multiple intermediate decisions without any explicit supervision, like which memory slot to read new information from, where to write it and when to stop.\n\n\n>I would like to see results of T=1 and T=2 of the proposed models to see how important the dynamic aspect of the model is. Although machine performance on the CNN/Daily News dataset is approaching human performance as the authors noted, I would nevertheless like to see the author demonstrate the effectiveness of this model on the CNN/Daily News dataset, as it has seen more interest in the community and is thus more competitive.\nWe will run the experiments and update the paper when we have the results. Please note that we would train roughly 12 models + CNN/Daily News experiments assuming that all hyper-parameters are available. Each model takes days/weeks to train. \nWhile we agree with the reviewer, we would also like to emphasize the importance of the CBTest and WDW datasets. The CBTest and WDW datasets seem to be gaining popularity quickly as there are multiple submissions at this conference, that are evaluated by using them.\n\n\nThanks again for the comments.\n\nBest,"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Reasoning with Memory Augmented Neural Networks for Language Comprehension", "abstract": "Hypothesis testing is an important cognitive process that supports human reasoning.

Is 13 an alternatively way of updating the query? Where is z_t in the query gating approach? For the adaptive computation approach, do you stop based on sampling from the normalized stopping score? Is this stopping decision supervised (it doesn't seem to be)? I would like to see results of T=1 and T=2 of the proposed models to see how important the dynamic aspect of the model is. Although machine performance on the CNN/Daily News dataset is approaching human performance as the authors noted, I would nevertheless like to see the author demonstrate the effectiveness of this model on the CNN/Daily News dataset, as it has seen more interest in the community and is thus more competitive.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Reasoning with Memory Augmented Neural Networks for Language Comprehension", "abstract": "Hypothesis testing is an important cognitive process that supports human reasoning.
