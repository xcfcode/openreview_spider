Their vision is that such a database could serve as a starting set of modules for neural architecture search algorithms.\n\nNeural architecture search and, more generally, AutoML, is definitely a topic of great interest for the community. As such, efforts to explore and better understand existing successful architectures are definitely worthwhile. \n\nWhile the idea proposed in the article is interesting, I have some major concerns regarding the way in which the database was created.\n\nFirstly, it appears that the authors did not apply any quality control mechanisms when selecting which GitHub repositories should be incorporated into the database. This means that, in effect, an implementation of a certain model written by a hobbyist or an undergraduate student trying to solve a homework problem is given the same relevance than repositories of papers subjected to peer-review or which are the result of large, coordinated development efforts by institutions with a proven track record of reliability. Most importantly, nothing seems to prevent their system from incorporating incorrect or incomplete implementations into their database.\n\nThis problem is compounded by the fact that the authors define the relevance of a subgraph entirely based on its frequency in the corpus: this could skew the distribution of \u201crelevant\u201d computational subgraphs found to those which are easier to use or simply more popular rather than those which account for performance improvements over a certain meaningful baseline.\n\nInstead, I strongly believe that the authors should: (1) think of quality control criteria to decide which repositories should be included and which ones should not and (2) give weights to repositories depending on how well they perform in a given task, and use such metric to substitute the mere frequency count they are currently using.\n\nFinally, while the main motivation of the paper seems to stem from AutoML, the authors provide no compelling evidence that their dataset can be used to improve existing neural architecture search algorithms.\n\n\nMinor points:\n\nThe text inside nodes of the computational graphs in Figure 1 is barely legible.\n\nThe choice of setting the support threshold to 30% seems arbitrary and should be better justified.\n\nKeeping only frequent subgraphs which are not contained by other frequent subgraphs is referred to as \u201cmaximal frequent subgraph mining\u201d in the data mining literature.\n\nTypos\n\nAbstract: \u201cA big issue(s) is its computational cost\u201d\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GitGraph - from Computational Subgraphs to Smaller Architecture Search Spaces", "abstract": "To simplify neural architecture creation, AutoML is gaining traction - from evolutionary algorithms to reinforcement learning or simple search in a constrained space of neural modules. \nA big issues is its computational cost: the size of the search space can easily go above 10^10 candidates for a 10-layer network and the cost of evaluating a single candidate is high - even if it's not fully trained.\nIn this work, we use the collective wisdom within the neural networks published in online code repositories to create better reusable neural modules.
