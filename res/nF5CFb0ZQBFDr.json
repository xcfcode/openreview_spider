I've added a couple clarifications\r\nregarding experiments on the PPMI dataset, you were indeed correct in\r\nyour assumptions.  I hope the experiments are now easier to understand.\r\n\r\nLet me respond to your 4 points:\r\n\r\n1)  In the case of PPMI, classification of an image as one where humans\r\nare playing an instrument vs. not playing can be done using only regions\r\nconcentrating on the instrument's interface with the human (mouth, hand,\r\netc.).  Any other regions in the image simply induce noise.  For\r\nexample, if we choose the static policy of looking only at the 4 central\r\nregions with the SVM classifier, we actually increase classification\r\naccuracy compared to looking at all regions.  Additionally, the\r\ndifference between the two datasets is that the 15 scenes dataset's task\r\nof detecitng the general environment in which the image was taken means\r\nthat classification information is much less concentrated in specific\r\nregions of the image, but rather spread out over the entire image.  This\r\nmay also explain why there is not such a strong advantage in using our\r\nmethod vs a random region selection policy for the 15 scenes dataset. \r\nI've added a brief mention of these aspects to the article.\r\n\r\n2)  Indeed, this behaviour would be most intuitive, however one possible\r\ninterpretation of these resuls is that regions preferred by B=8 are very\r\ninformative, but only if /all/ can be acquired, and if only a subset can\r\nbe acquired then it is better to select region (1,3).  Of course this is\r\npure conjecture, it is unfortunately very difficult to understand /why/\r\nthe algorithm performs the trade-offs that it does, but this is indeed\r\nan interesting remark, and warrants further investigation.  \r\n\r\n3) If I understand correctly, once we would have trained the chain a\r\nfirst time, we could run the training examples down the chain, and train\r\nthe final classifier with the new distribution of provided regions, and\r\nthen re-train the chain again using this new final classifier.  This is something we've attempted without significant increase in performance, and significantly increases learning complexity.\r\n\r\n4) Ideally, if there is some way to estimate the 'best' of the 'bad'\r\nactions during training, then it might be a good idea to use this as a\r\npositive training example, but ideally with an associated weight to\r\nindicate that it is however not as good as an actually optimal action.\r\nIn the case of a binary classification task there is no obvious way to\r\ninstore an order amongst all the 'bad' actions since they all result\r\nultimately in incorrect classification, however if there is some\r\nstructure on the label set with a similarity measure, then this would be\r\nimportant information to leverage, thus allowing us to penalize the\r\nclassifier with a negative reward related to how 'far off' the\r\nclassifier's prediction was in label space."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequentially Generated Instance-Dependent Image Representations for Classification", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a new framework for image classification that adaptively generates spatial representations.

This is accomplished by training a chain of region selection predictors, each one of which outputs the k'th region to take, given the image features from k-1 already-selected regions.  Each selector is trained to choose a region that leads to an eventual correct classification, given already-trained downstream selectors.  Since downstream predictions are required for training, the chain is trained last-to-first, and random region selection is used to generate training inputs at each stage.  Both the conditional region selection chain and its training method are interesting contributions.\r\n\r\nThe method is evaluated on two tasks, playing vs. holding a musical instrument (PPMI) and outdoor scene classification (15-Scenes).  Here, I wish the authors were more detailed in their descriptions of these tasks.  In particular, I'm a bit unsure whether the PPMI task is a 12-way classification on musical instruments, or an average of 12 binary classification tasks (playing vs holding), one for each instrument.  I think it's the latter -- if so, I'm also unclear on whether a different selection/classification chain was trained and tested for each of the 12 subsets, or if a single classifier was trained over the entire dataset.\r\n\r\nStill, the proposed method beats a random selection baseline for both tasks (though not by much for 15-Scenes), and for PPMI it also beats a baseline of including all regions.  The latter is a particularly nice result, since intuitively region selection should stand to help performance, yet such gains can be hard to find.  Evaluating the 12- or 24-way instrument classification task for PPMI would have been good here as well, though, as there is clearly a compatibility between region selection and this data and/or task, and this may help provide insight into why that is.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n- Interesting and new method of region selection trained for classification\r\n- Shows a nice gain in one task and reasonable results in another\r\n- Interesting discussion sheds light on how the method operates (figs 7, 8)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n- Tasks and datasets could be better explained\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n- Why does selecting 8 regions beat using all 16 for PPMI but is only about the same for 15-Scenes?  Some discussion on the difference between the two datasets and their fit with region selection would be nice here.\r\n\r\n- Fig. 8:  I might have expected the B=8 (right) histogram to have its highest values mostly where the B=4 (left) histogram does, since one would think the best regions would be required in both cases.  However, region 3 (x=1,y=3) seems to be used with more frequency for B=4 than B=8, for example.  Why does this occur?\r\n\r\n- Is it possible to continue retraining the classifier and selectors?  Currently the chain is trained once, starting with the classifier and proceeding upstream.  Yet by doing this, each stage must be trained on a random sample of input regions, which can include many more configurations than would be seen at test time.  Could each stage (particularly the final classifier f) be iteratively retrained given *all* selectors?  Would this help by adjusting the training distribution closer to the test distribution and allowing better use of resources, or might it lead to worse generalization by narrowing the training set too much?\r\n\r\n- Alg. 4 adds a sample to the training set only if it leads to a correct prediction.  But what if no region has this property -- is it better to ignore these cases, or should some be included (perhaps by trying to predict the choice closest to correct)?  Surely such cases will arise at test time, and the consequences of ignoring them isn't entirely clear.  I suppose there's an argument to be made that the classifier will eventually fail anyway, so it's better to bail on these cases and concentrate the predictor's resources only on those where it stands a chance.  But in cases where the classifier is wrong, might this also lead to more arbitrary region selection and more drastic types of mistakes (e.g. mistaking a clarinet for a harp vs a recorder)?"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequentially Generated Instance-Dependent Image Representations for Classification", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a new framework for image classification that adaptively generates spatial representations.

Let me respond in a couple points to your comments:\r\n\r\n1. Classifier complexity:  In effect, the training algorithm is more complex than a standard SVM, but it only increases in complexity linearly relative to the fixed budget B and the number of windows.  Inference complexity is lower than an SVM computed on the entire picture, and is B times more complex than a fixed SVM on a B-sized window.  \r\n\r\n2. With regards to the work of Larochelle & Hinton on foveal glimpse learning, there is a fundamental difference in what is being learned by the region selection algorithm. L&H learn a gaze direction model that greedily chooses regions that are most likely to increase the final classifier's output given the current state.  In our model, intermediate sub-policies learn to select regions that help their subsequent policy the most.  The final sub-policy indeed learns to select a Bth region that helps classification, but each of the previous policies learns to select a region that will best disambiguate the image information given the curernt state, only ultimately helping in classification.  This detail is important, as a greedy system will not spend time on image regions that are irrelevant to classification, but necessary to region selection.   Typically, in Experiment 2, H&L's system must be given a starting point, and would (as far as we can tell) not be able to find it on its own."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sequentially Generated Instance-Dependent Image Representations for Classification", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a new framework for image classification that adaptively generates spatial representations.

The approach decomposes an image into multiple non-overlapping sub-windows, and tries to find a sequence of subsets of these sub-windows that can efficiently lead to classify the image. The idea is interesting as it could potentially classify faster by concentrating only on the relevant part of the image; on the other hand, the training complexity is significantly increased (and I suspect for the approach to work we should include many more sub-windows at various scales and potentially with overlaps). The proposed approach is not compared to any other approaches, for instance the work of Larochelle and Hinton, 2010. The results are encouraging but not groundbreaking: it seems one needs to see a significant portion of the image in order to get similar or better performance than the baseline, so it's not clear the proposal works that well.
