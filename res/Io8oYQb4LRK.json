It's not clear that for regularization parameters that this problem exists or that your method would apply.\n\nA small nit:  Is hypervariance the right thing to look at, since the problem can exist even in deterministic settings?  Perhaps some sort of sensitivity analysis would be more appropriate.  Also you should reference Barack Pearlmutter's thesis which first explores these issues.   I would also mention that the hypervariance is generally tiny for smaller-than-optimal learning rates, and massive for larger-than-optimal learning rates, (the chaotic regime)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-greedy Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization Over Long Horizons", "authorids": ["~Paul_Micaelli1", "~Amos_Storkey1"], "authors": ["Paul Micaelli", "Amos Storkey"], "keywords": ["Hyperparameter optimization", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Gradient-based meta-learning has earned a widespread popularity in few-shot learning, but remains broadly impractical for tasks with long horizons (many gradient steps), due to memory scaling and gradient degradation issues.

We've had time to run BOHB experiments, and hope to expend on our last comment below.\n\nThe range of alpha stated previously was taken from the tables in the appendices of the BOHB paper (Table 1,3,4). Note that the range for the CIFAR-10 experiment doesn't seem to be given, so we stated the range used for alpha in related experiments in the paper. \n\nOur last comment was based on BO experiments only, and assuming BOHB would suffer from similar issues. Since then, we ran BOHB and Hyperband experiments using the same search range, network and computational budget as our method. We use the HpBandSter library (https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/index.html) which provides both methods. We use all standard BOHB hyperparameters and set  min budget equal to $5$ epochs.\n\n On CIFAR-10, we obtained $\\sim 87$% with BOHB and $\\sim 85$% with Hyperband. Although more seeds should be run, evidently you were correct in pointing out that BOHB is better than BO and RS (while still falling short compared to using gradients, since our method gets $\\sim 89$%). These preliminary results also indicate that the 'HB' component of 'BOHB' is mostly responsible for the good performance in our setting. Indeed, setting min budget = max budget for BOHB recovers the poor performance we observed in BO. \n \n Note that some for of successive halving/HB could be combined to our method in future work to make our approach cheaper. We also expect that the gap between our method and BOHB would broaden if more hyperparameters were searched (and shrink for less hyperparameters), since BO/RS based-methods typically struggle with many hyperparameters.\n \nIn short, after running more experiments we now agree with Reviewer 1 that adding these extra baselines do make the paper more complete, and we plan to do so once final results have all come in. Again, we thank Reviewer 1 for taking the time to follow through on this discussion."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper791/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper791/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-greedy Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization Over Long Horizons", "authorids": ["~Paul_Micaelli1", "~Amos_Storkey1"], "authors": ["Paul Micaelli", "Amos Storkey"], "keywords": ["Hyperparameter optimization", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Gradient-based meta-learning has earned a widespread popularity in few-shot learning, but remains broadly impractical for tasks with long horizons (many gradient steps), due to memory scaling and gradient degradation issues.

We hope to address your points in what follows. \n\n1. *The forward-mode algorithm is limited to SGD with momentum and weight-decay*. While we chose to only show results on the SGD optimizer with momentum and weight decay, our method is applicable to any differentiable hyperparameter, which includes most modern optimizers. We focused on the optimizer that is by far the most common for CIFAR-10 so that the reader has a feel for what sensible hyperparameter values are, which hyperparameters are useful etc. while looking at our results. Other optimizers have different matrices $A, B, C$ but their derivation is analogous to that shown in Appendix A. We have clarified this point at the end of section 3.2.\n\n\n2. *It\u2019s not clear to me the sign of the hypergradient is a good test for convergence. If we can\u2019t use modern optimizers like Adam with the hypergradient, I am worried that the algorithm is very brittle*. The hypergradient signs was observed to make convergence faster than other common optimizers. Hypergradients don't have the same distribution as common neural network gradients, and as such common optimizers are not the most appropriate. For instance, the hypergradient on the first step can be much larger than subsequent steps, because the first step has zero learning rate and therefore a small positive change in learning rate creates a large change in the validation loss. As such, using a momentum-based outer optimizers like Adam can bias subsequent gradient steps, and slow down outer optimization. This is not the result of unstable hypergradients, but rather a result of their natural distribution.\n\n\n3. *The improvements aren't very large relative to the hand-tuned baseline*. This is correct. For the hand tuned baseline we searched ``around'' the standard hyperparameter settings used in the literature for CIFAR-10 and Wide-ResNets. It is hard to state how much time the community has collectively invested to settle on these hyperparameters, but we considered them to be an approximate upper bound for this dataset/network. Therefore the argument here is that our method can match the performance of this upper bound while other search methods fail to. While our hand tuned baseline did take more time to run, we didn't make that argument since it all depends on the size and quality of the search range chosen, which could be made arbitrarily large probably without improving the performance of the setting found. \n\n\n4. *A good baseline to test against might be Bayesian optimization as opposed to grid-search*. Other reviewers have made this point so we have included our reply as a separate comment on this page.\n\n\n5. *What happens if you start your training with the hyperparameters initialized at the best-value from the grid-search?*. We have tried this setting and did not find a significant improvements when considering several seeds. This seems to come from the fact that the scale of the noise on the validation loss irons out the margin for improvement around the hand-tuned configuration. In other words, small improvements can be observed for a given train-val split, but no significant improvement is found that holds for any train-val split.\n\n\n6. *Typo in Figure 1?*. This was not a typo but our phrasing was somewhat confusing and has been clarified.

We hope to clarify some elements of our methods in what follows.\n\n\n1. We use the term \"greedy\" the same way it is sometimes used in computer science, to describe \"any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage\" (see Wikipedia page for Greedy Algorithm). Consider training a network on CIFAR for 50 epochs. Now consider the process of learning the best learning rate to use for epoch 1. We can find this learning rate such that it minimizes validation loss after epoch 1, but this is greedy (local). Indeed, what we we really want to find is the learning rate for epoch 1 that minimizes the validation loss after 50 epochs (non-greedy). We briefly defined greediness as locality in the introduction, and formalized it at the end of section 3.1. We added some explanations in Related Work. Please let us know if we could further clarify things in some way.\n\n\n2. You are correct that showing the benefits of averaging out hypergradients from contiguous hyperparameters is the main contribution of our paper, as stated in (1) at the bottom of our introduction. However, this only becomes relevant for long horizons (where gradient degradation occurs), for which reverse-mode differentiation cannot be applied. Therefore, integrating this as part of a forward mode algorithm in a way that works also made up other contributions of this paper\n\n\n3. The size of the hyperparameter search space is given in Appendix B for all experiments. Since we share hyperparameters across steps, we can learn schedules over many steps by only learning a few values (5+1+1 in Fig1). You are correct when saying that one outer step can be more expensive for our method than other methods, but results in Table 1 are computed over the same GPU budget for each method (so more outer steps are taken for random search, since it's very cheap). Forward mode differentiation is indeed paramount to our algorithm, because reverse mode does not scale well in memory for long horizons (see beginning of section 3.2).\n\n\n4. This is related to weight sharing. When a parameter is shared across two computational graphs (i.e. two operations), its total gradient is the sum of the gradients coming from each graph. Therefore sharing two hyperparameter is the same as summing the hypergradients they would each get individually if there was no sharing. The average can be obtained manually from the sum trivially. This property was checked using the Pytorch autodiff.\n\n\nWe hope that this helps clarify things. If this wasn't enough to address your queries, please let us know the points that remain unclear and we would be happy to pursue this discussion further. Again, we thank you for time you invested in reading our paper.

We hope to address your points in what follows.\n\n\n1. *How does this work compare against tools like BOHB?* We have included a separate comment on experiments based on Bayesian optimization on this page. The bottom line is that methods that rely on Bayesian optimization (like BOHB) struggle to even match random search in our experimental setting, where the search range is large and the computational budget is low. For instance, BOHB searches hyperparameters in narrow ranges that only contain reasonably good values (e.g $\\alpha \\in [10^{-6}, 10^{-1}]$ using a log scale inductive bias) while our experiment makes much fewer assumptions about the hyperparameters we are searching  ($\\alpha \\in [-1, 1]$). Finally, our method runs in about 13 GPU hours while BOHB is run for 33 GPU days (albeit on a larger architecture). We have added the BOHB paper in related work, because it is still relevant to our paper.\n\n\n2. *Structure of the paper.* We agree that a Background section would make our contribution clearer, so we have moved 3.1 and 3.2 to section \"3 Background\" and changed 3.3 to section \"4.0 Enabling Non-Greediness\". Thank you.\n\n\n3. *Justification for hyperparameter sharing and sign-based outer optimizer.* While we concede that a more theoretical approach could make up interesting future work, there is some justification for these heuristics. Hyperparameter sharing averages the hypergradient of contiguous hyperparameters, and therefore is expected to reduce noise, because the standard error of the mean (SEM) is inversely proportional to $\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of samples to calculate the mean (here, the number of shared steps). Of course this picture only holds if we assume that the hypergradients for contiguous steps come from the same distribution, which may not be the case. This point was added in section 4. Finally, using the oscillation in sign as a measure of convergence is motivated by the following. If the hypergradient is negative at $\\alpha_1$, the hyperparameter is updated to $\\alpha_2 = \\alpha_1 + \\gamma$ with $\\gamma > 0$. Now if the hypergradient at $\\alpha_2$ is positive, it is a signal that the best $\\alpha$ hyperparameter is in the range $[\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2]$, so we let $\\gamma \\leftarrow \\gamma/2$. After a while $\\gamma \\rightarrow 0$. \n\n\n4. *Minor remarks.* These were all helpful. We have opted to keep Figure 1 on the first page and instead clarified what outer steps are in the caption. We followed your advice on all other points.

We have, in fact, run numerous BO experiments for our experimental configuration. We used the highly efficient BoTorch-Ax library, with the common BO settings found in the HPO literature: Gaussian process with Matern 5/2 kernel, with expected improvement (EI) as the acquisition function, and using Sobol search for the first few arms. \n\nIn the paper, we sought to showcase the efficiency of using gradients in HPO by considering a large hyperparameter search range. This means that we assume very little about the hyperparameters we are trying to learn. For instance we learn the learning rate in a range $\\alpha \\in [-1, 1]$ while a common search range in BO would be about $20$ times smaller like $\\alpha \\in [10^{-6}, 10^{-1}] $ [1], and would use a log scaling prior to search this space in a way that is tailored for learning rates. In our setting, we find that BO and related methods struggle to even match random search. This is because the search space mostly contains configurations that have a high validation loss, and BO spends much of its time exploring irrelevant fluctuations in that high loss region. In order to slightly outperform random search with BO, we had to divide the search range by $\\sim 20$ and use $5$ times the computational budget. Indeed BO is usually orders of magnitude more expensive to run than our method, with some methods reporting up to $33$ GPU days on CIFAR-10 [1] while our algorithm takes $\\sim 13$ hours (albeit for smaller architectures).  Finally, note that random search has often been found to match or outperform more complex search algorithms in follow up work, pointing to the fact that the success of HPO algorithms can often be explained by a narrow and contrived search range [2] [3]. \n\nWe have included this information in Appendix E and pointed to it from the main text. We thank the reviewer for making this point and thereby anticipating future reader comments.

This novel method enables non-greediness through the mitigation of gradient degradation and allows for long horizons.\n\nHow does this work compare against tools like BOHB (not cited in this paper) [1]? The method introduced here is based on hypergradients while BOHB is based on a combination of Hyperband and Bayesian optimization, so these are two different algorithms. Nonetheless, since BOHB can perhaps be considered state-of-the-art for DNN HPO including continuous and discrete hyperparameters, it is still worth to provide a  comparison in the experimental section. This is reinforced by the fact that the authors use random sampling as a baseline which has been shown to be inferior to BOHB on similar or identical benchmarks.  \n\nIn the methodology section, 3.1 and 3.2 are background material. It'd perhaps be clearer if the authors move these parts in a background section so as to differentiate the contributions from the background. The contribution section of this paper is section 3.3 where the key idea is the reduction of the hypervariance induced by the gradient degradation phenomenon. In the experiment section, the authors define the hypervariance, which should be defined in a previous section instead of the empirical part. Or else, since the hypervariance is somewhat defined twice, these two parts could be merged in section 3.3.  \n\nTo reduce the hypervariance the authors propose hyperparameter sharing and show empirically how it helps gradient degradation. In addition, the authors propose to use gradient signs as an indicator of convergence and show the impact empirically. No formal justification is provided for these two contributions which is a weakness of the paper. \n\nMinor remarks: \n- The abstract should explicitly mention that this is a Deep learning paper. The authors shouldn't expect that since the paper is submitted at ICLR then a reader will know that the paper is on DL. \n- It is usually a good idea to have the figures either at the beginning or at the end of a page rather than in the middle of the page. See for example Figure 2. \n- It is odd to have figure 1 on the second page if the figure is then used on page 8. On page 2, the readers are not able to understand the figure because the outer step in the figure is introduced later in the text. \n\n[1] Falkner, Stefan, Aaron Klein, and Frank Hutter. \"BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale.\" ICML. 2018.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper791/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper791/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Non-greedy Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization Over Long Horizons", "authorids": ["~Paul_Micaelli1", "~Amos_Storkey1"], "authors": ["Paul Micaelli", "Amos Storkey"], "keywords": ["Hyperparameter optimization", "Meta-learning"], "abstract": "Gradient-based meta-learning has earned a widespread popularity in few-shot learning, but remains broadly impractical for tasks with long horizons (many gradient steps), due to memory scaling and gradient degradation issues.

IMO the main weakness of the paper is the clarity, for instance I had to read the article multiple times before understanding the main contribution. Some crucial terms should may have to be mathematically defined in the paper, like 'greedyness' for hyperparameter optimization, a term a was not aware of.\n\n\nAdvantages of the paper:\n- the proposed algorithm seems to lead to significance gain in performance in practice\n- authors proposed a new stopping criterion which seems to be more efficient in practice\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n1- The notion of greedyness is paramount for the paper, however it is not defined. Moreover the references provided are not very helpful to understand the concept. The word 'greedy' appears once in [1], twice in [4] and is not defined properly. The word 'greedy' does not appear in [2, 3]. Would it be possible for the authors to define the concept properly in the paper, or the provide a selfcontained reference?\n\n2- I founded the main contribution of the paper hard to find. If I understood well, authors propose a new to estimate the hypergradient by averaging out, and then updating the hyperparameter. This is very subjective, I would recommend to highlight this contribution, and maybe to remove 'we combined the above [...] with momentum decay' in the introduction.\n\n3- The experiments do not seem clear to me, I do not know if it comes from my lack of experience in the field of from the lack of clarity of the paper, but experiments were hard to follow. In particular the number of steps in the inner problem is provided, but what is the size of the hyperparameter searching space? In particular all the experiments are provided with convergence as a function of the number of steps. Since authors rely on forward differentiation, one step of the proposed algorithm can be more costly than one step of the algorithms in the baseline. Am I missing something? Is forward differentiation paramount for the proposed algorithm?\n\n4- Authors claim that hyperparameter sharing is equivalent to averaging (page 5). Is it mathematically grounded? Is it trivial? Or could authors provide a reference?\n\nThere are a lot of things I did not understand, thus I voted for weak reject. However if authors answer my questions I am of course willing to change my score.\n\n\nMinor:\n- in section 1 there should have a space after the point in l3\n\n\n[1] Luketina, J., Berglund, M., Greff, K., & Raiko, T.

We implement this with forward-mode differentiation, which we extend to the popular momentum-based SGD optimizer. We demonstrate that the hyperparameters of this optimizer can be learned non-greedily without gradient degradation over $\\sim 10^4$ inner gradient steps, by only requiring $\\sim 10$ outer gradient steps. On CIFAR-10, we outperform greedy and random search methods for the same computational budget by nearly $10\\%$.
