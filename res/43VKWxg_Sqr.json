We address below.", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for bringing up these points: \n\n**Results could be better**\nWe agree that our current results can still be improved. Our method is based on manipulations of Mel-spectrograms. This makes the quality of our generation results heavily dependent on the wavenet vocoders, which reconstruct raw audio signals from Mel-spectrograms. From our observation, the transformation between Mel-spectrograms and audio signals is not lossless, especially for those in-the-wild audio samples. We believe our results will benefit from a more advanced vocoder, as well as a model structure with raw audio input. Future work in these directions using in-the-wild dataset will help address the challenges.\n\n**Are models trained with native English speakers?**\nThe standard VCTK dataset only contains native English speakers with various accents. Our CelebAudio dataset contains both native (e.g. John Oliver) and non-native (e.g. Takeo Kanade) English speakers. We have clarified this in Sec 4.1 in our revised edition and provided dataset details in the appendix.\n\n**Why not use i-vectors/x-vectors instead of Mel spectrograms?**\nI-vectors [3] and x-vectors [4] are learned features for speaker classification (which is a different task than speech synthesis), while Mel spectrograms are non-learned Fourier features. The heart of our approach is learning representations on the target clip of interest, rather than a large training corpus with many styles. Using pre-trained representations may limit our ability to capture target-specific styles, but specializing them to the target could potentially help. For simplicity, we use non-learned Fourier representations used by other voice conversion approaches [1,2].\n\n[1] Qian, Kaizhi, et al. \"Autovc: Zero-shot voice style transfer with only autoencoder loss.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.05879 (2019).\n\n[2] Chou, Ju-chieh, Cheng-chieh Yeh, and Hung-yi Lee. \"One-shot voice conversion by separating speaker and content representations with instance normalization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.05742 (2019).\n\n[3] Ibrahim, Noor Salwani, and Dzati Athiar Ramli. \"I-vector extraction for speaker recognition based on dimensionality reduction.\" Procedia Computer Science 126 (2018): 1534-1540.\n\n[4] Snyder, David, et al. \"Deep Neural Network Embeddings for Text-Independent Speaker Verification.\" Interspeech. 2017.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1197/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1197/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Audiovisual Synthesis via Exemplar Autoencoders", "authorids": ["~Kangle_Deng1", "~Aayush_Bansal1", "~Deva_Ramanan1"], "authors": ["Kangle Deng", "Aayush Bansal", "Deva Ramanan"], "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "autoencoders", "speech-impaired", "assistive technology", "audiovisual synthesis", "voice conversion"], "abstract": "We present an unsupervised approach that converts the input speech of any individual into audiovisual streams of potentially-infinitely many output speakers.

We have modified the manuscript.", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their careful review and pointer to the related work. We address specific concerns below.\n\n**What are Exemplar Autoencoders?** \nWe apologize for the confusion and have rewritten the intro paragraph in Sec.3 and the caption of Fig.3 to succinctly explain our approach: exemplar autoencoders are simply autoencoders trained on a single clip containing a single speech style. We use the term exemplar to contrast them with autoencoders trained on large-scale datasets spanning many clips and many styles. Training autoencoders on a single style allows them to act as translation engines that preserve out-of-sample content (words) while transferring onto the (single) target style.\n\n**Comparison to Zero-Shot Approaches. How do they work?** \nPrior work (such as Auto-VC [1]) trains a model for speech conversion using a large corpus of speeches from many speakers. Once trained, this model can be used to synthesize the voice of a new person who was not seen during training by requiring a small sample of speech from the target person at test-time. This small sample is processed by a style encoder (trained on a large corpus) that returns a style embedding. We denote this with the \u201cinput style from target speaker\u201d text in Fig-2a. In some sense, our approach dispenses with the large corpus of training data altogether and uses only this small target speech sample (to train an exemplar autoencoder).\n\n**What does retargeting mean?** \nThis term has been used in the computer graphics literature for motion retargeting or video retargeting, which often implies resynthesizing media content with a new identity. We will clarify.\n\n[1] Qian, Kaizhi, et al. \"Autovc: Zero-shot voice style transfer with only autoencoder loss.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.05879 (2019).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1197/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1197/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Audiovisual Synthesis via Exemplar Autoencoders", "authorids": ["~Kangle_Deng1", "~Aayush_Bansal1", "~Deva_Ramanan1"], "authors": ["Kangle Deng", "Aayush Bansal", "Deva Ramanan"], "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "autoencoders", "speech-impaired", "assistive technology", "audiovisual synthesis", "voice conversion"], "abstract": "We present an unsupervised approach that converts the input speech of any individual into audiovisual streams of potentially-infinitely many output speakers.

We reframed Sec 3.2 to highlight \u201cautoencoders for style transfer\u201d, rather than \u201cautoencoders as projection operators\u201d. We have added previous work in \u201cSec 2 Autoencoders\u201d that explicitly points out this projection property (e.g., denoising autoencoders [1] that project noisy inputs onto the data manifold). To our knowledge, autoencoders have been primarily applied to tasks such as dimensionality reduction and feature learning [2], while we repurpose their projection property for style transfer (by re-stylizing out-of-sample content onto the style of the target).

(2002).)\n\nI found the paper slightly verbose -- I'm not sure i fully \"got\" the central concept of Exemplar Autoencoders. Looking at Section 3, with that in the title, I was waiting to find the canonical definition of E.A.'s, but don't quite see it -- it seems somewhat unclear given the many variants of auto-encoders discussed. The discussion in Section 2, and e.g. Figure 2c, help clarify what the author's mean by EA's. What I'm not fully sure about is, are EA's basically what I would call Auto-encoders? Fig 3c is labeled \"Exemplar Autoencoder\", but then the caption for 3c mentions \"Non-linear autoencoder\", which is confusing. The caption starts with \"Figure 3: Our insights for Exemplar Autoencoders, \" leading me to think that actually all three of these sub-figures are variants of Exemplar Autoencoders. Maybe they could clarify their terminology or re-read the draft from the perspective of someone who is not as \"close\" to the work as they are.\n\nThe contrast with zero-shot conversion is very interesting -- but here too I feel I am somewhat missing the explanation of the essence of these zero-shot methods -- though it is possible most readers do not need any additional explanation. In particular, when I see Fig 2a, I'm wondering how the content and speaker embedding vectors are trained (and on what data), and the text doesn't quite clarify that for me.\n\nMore specific comments follow:\n\n\"(a) Zero-shot conversion that learns a generic low-dimensional embedding from a training set that _are_ designed ...\": \"are\" --> \"is\".\n\n\" In supp material, ...\" --> \"In supplementary material, ...\"\n\nDefine \"retargeting\"?\n\nTable 2: Use up & down errors, as you did in a later table, to indicate whether higher/lower is better.\n\nNo conclusion?

The presented approach is unsupervised, which makes it more practical. This approach required only a small amount of data to train the exemplar autoencoders when learning specialized models tailored to particular target data.\n\ncons: \n1- After listening to the provided sample demo files. I think this approach is still in an immature status. The generated output speech is highly distorted, without knowing the input speech, it is hard to understand the generated speech. Hence, more work is required to improve on the audio decoder part. \n2- It is not mentioned if the data used for training is all speech of native English speakers or not.\n3- Any reasons authors did not use the x-vector or i-vectors, which are proper for the speaker characterization, and instead used mel features? \n\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1197/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1197/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unsupervised Audiovisual Synthesis via Exemplar Autoencoders", "authorids": ["~Kangle_Deng1", "~Aayush_Bansal1", "~Deva_Ramanan1"], "authors": ["Kangle Deng", "Aayush Bansal", "Deva Ramanan"], "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "autoencoders", "speech-impaired", "assistive technology", "audiovisual synthesis", "voice conversion"], "abstract": "We present an unsupervised approach that converts the input speech of any individual into audiovisual streams of potentially-infinitely many output speakers.
