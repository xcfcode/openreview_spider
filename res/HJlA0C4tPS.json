On unsupervised machine translation, authors show a large improvement on Serbian-Bostian translation.

This is an extremely important point and is something we believe can be cleared up -- specifically, we believe we have supported the case in additional experiments (see below) that this is an optimization issue instead of modeling issue. \n\nStop-gradient can be viewed as an approximation technique for optimizing the training objective of the proposed probabilistic model. As you mention, many techniques fall into this category: Gumbel softmax approximates the true gradient with a biased estimator, hoping to reduce variance. Other techniques yield unbiased estimators, but at the cost of higher variance. Finding an effective optimization technique for a given model class often involves some degree of empirical exploration of the bias-variance tradeoff. Stop-gradient, when viewed in this light, is certainly a biased estimator of the true gradient, but may substantially reduce variance. We completely agree that this point could be supported more effectively with further experiments and comparisons. Specifically, is stop-gradient actually a better optimizer for our model class than Gumbel softmax or REINFORCE? Or does stop-gradient just lead to better task performance without actually better optimizing the modeling objective we claim to care about? If the latter were true, your concern about a disconnect between model and training procedure would be well-founded.\n\nIn order to resolve this, we have run additional experiments on the sentiment transfer task. We compare stop-gradient, Gumbel softmax, and REINFORCE as optimization techniques, reporting the best train and test ELBO under our model class achieved with each approach -- as well as task performance corresponding to best test ELBO. These results are presented in Table 5 and discussed in Section 5.4 of the updated paper draft. \n\nThe key finding is that stop-gradient leads to better training and test ELBO in our model class than propagating gradients with either REINFORCE or Gumbel softmax, validating stop-gradient as a better choice if our goal is truly to optimize our models training objective. (In other words, whichever optimization method achieves the better ELBO can be seen as a superior method for optimizing the proposed fully probabilistic model.) Further, across optimization methods, ELBO is correlated with task performance -- i.e. for these three optimization methods, the better the final ELBO achieved, the better the task performance.  \n\nTogether, we hope these results help support the case that, while somewhat unsatisfying a priori as a gradient estimator, the use of stop-gradient is in fact about optimization in our actual model class. If you think it would help support the case further, we can add similar experiments on the other tasks in future revisions. We also believe that one nice thing about our probabilistic formulation is that it allows us to separate out problems of learning the model and optimization, as we did here. This could help guide future work in better ways to optimize such probabilistic objectives. \n\n\n\n## Q2: Similarities to unsupervised neural machine translation\nYes, we agree that the underlying ELBO objective for our model class is similar to non-ELBO training objectives used in related unsupervised MT systems. However, we believe this is partially a strength: One goal of this paper is a probabilistic formulation that relates and interprets prior work. That said, there are important distinctions between our ELBO objective and objectives used in related work. For example, the main difference between the proposed model and UNMT is the added language model and the KL loss term. As mentioned in the paper, the language model is more useful when the two domains are less divergent, where the language models behave like a discriminator to avoid copying, and copying is very likely to happen in this case without supervised data. Therefore, the proposed model performs similarly to UNMT on decipherment where the vocabulary from two domains are completely different.

Due to time limitations we could only address major points, but we\u2019ll make sure to reflect all advice in future revisions.\n\n## Q1: Comparison of greedy and sampling decoding in terms of ELBO\nWe agree that a comparison between gradient approximation techniques in this context would be informative. In preliminary experiments not included in the paper draft we tried various approaches -- in retrospect (and based on your comment) we realize it makes complete sense to include this analysis. Thanks for the suggestion! \n\nWe have updated the paper with a comparison between greedy and sample-based gradient approximations for ELBO on the sentiment transfer task. Please see the last paragraph in Section 5.3 and Table 4 for details. Here we report training ELBO, test ELBO, and task performance. We find that the greedy approximation leads to better optimization of both training and test ELBO and better task performance. It\u2019s worth noting that once the model is trained, the sample-based approximation of ELBO is low-varaince. Thus, in Table 4, we are showing the sample-based training ELBO regardless of the gradient approximation technique. The fact that the greedy gradient approximation leads better ELBO optimization even though the greedy estimator is biased indicates that the sampled-based approximation (which is unbiased) has much higher variance during the early stages of learning -- we are trading variance for bias with positive effect. Using more samples might mitigate this issue during training, but would require substantially more computation. We are currently running additional experiments to explore methods for reducing training variance with sample-based approximations, and hope to include these results in future revisions.\n\n## Q2: Would it be beneficial to control each term in KL separately?\nThis is a good point, and we believe that it would be beneficial with more control for each term. However, this also introduces an additional tunable hyperparameter. Due to time limitation we are not able to fully verify this hypothesis on these tasks, but we will try to include experimental analysis regarding this separate control in the next revision. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1451/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1451/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["junxianh@cs.cmu.edu", "xinyiw1@cs.cmu.edu", "gneubig@cs.cmu.edu", "tberg@eng.ucsd.edu"], "title": "A Probabilistic Formulation of Unsupervised Text Style Transfer", "authors": ["Junxian He", "Xinyi Wang", "Graham Neubig", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick"], "pdf": "/pdf/b040383264bfff0ce2ed87f26c4859dcf3ab59be.pdf", "TL;DR": "We formulate a probabilistic latent sequence model to tackle unsupervised text style transfer, and show its effectiveness across a suite of unsupervised text style transfer tasks.

Given two non-parallel corpora X,Y in different domains, the authors introduce unobserved corpora \\bar{X}, \\bar{Y}. These are used as latent variables that control the generation of the observed data. To train models, the paper proposes to optimize the evidence lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. To facilitate training, multiple techniques are suggested, such as parameter sharing, some gradient approximations and initialization with a reconstruction objective. The approach is evaluated on five style transfer tasks, as well as unsupervised machine translation. Models are evaluated with multiple metrics, and generally obtain reasonably strong performance.\n\nI lean towards the acceptance of the paper because the approach is fairly simple and elegant, while obtaining promising results. The connections to back-translation and language models are also potentially interesting. However, while the paper aims to suggest a principled approach to style transfer, using greedy samples biases the reconstruction objective, and as such the method does not really optimize the ELBO.\n\nCasting style transfer as data completion is a straight-forward idea that doesn't introduce unnecessary or too simplistic assumptions. Optimizing the ELBO follows naturally, and can lead to more diverse outputs than the BT+NLL approach, which misses the negative entropy term. Reference BLEU scores on all tasks are competitive, and sometimes clearly better, with strong baselines.\n\nGreedily sampling latent sequences during training should ideally be justified more carefully as it biases the objective function. In particular, an experimental comparison to stochastic sampling, which should more closely approximate the expectation, would be appreciated. Additionally, detailing the similarities and differences between the proposed approach and current UNMT techniques could be helpful to some readers.\n\nQuestions:\n\nCould you present the validation and test evidence lower bounds? If so, how is sampling performed?\n\nIn footnote 2, you mention tuning the strength of the KL regularizer. As the KL can be decomposed into 2 terms (Eq. 5), would it be beneficial to control each term separately?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1451/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1451/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["junxianh@cs.cmu.edu", "xinyiw1@cs.cmu.edu", "gneubig@cs.cmu.edu", "tberg@eng.ucsd.edu"], "title": "A Probabilistic Formulation of Unsupervised Text Style Transfer", "authors": ["Junxian He", "Xinyi Wang", "Graham Neubig", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick"], "pdf": "/pdf/b040383264bfff0ce2ed87f26c4859dcf3ab59be.pdf", "TL;DR": "We formulate a probabilistic latent sequence model to tackle unsupervised text style transfer, and show its effectiveness across a suite of unsupervised text style transfer tasks.

An\nencoder-decoder model is trained to transfer text from one style\nto another and back.\n\nReview:\n\nThis work is very well-written and easy to follow. The\ncontribution is clearly articulated as while there are\nprobabilistic generative models for transfer in the\nliterature (Shen et al does include one) they don't perform as\nwell. Ablation studies further confirm the need for the\nparticular kind of parameter sharing used in the model in the\npaper. Great results are shown on 5 text transfer problems.\n\nClarifications and improvements:\n\nJust for clarity, in the last paragraph on page 4. It says two encoder-decoder\nmodels are learnt, but isn't the idea that there is effectively only one\nencoder and one decoder learned that just put together in different ways\nduring training? I'm also curious why the baseline of BT+NLL was so strong? Is\nhaving the loss of a language model work that much better than the regular\nentropy term?\n\nI would also like if possible if you could share some of the repetitive examples\ncreated by BT-NLL which explain its low PPL."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1451/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1451/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["junxianh@cs.cmu.edu", "xinyiw1@cs.cmu.edu", "gneubig@cs.cmu.edu", "tberg@eng.ucsd.edu"], "title": "A Probabilistic Formulation of Unsupervised Text Style Transfer", "authors": ["Junxian He", "Xinyi Wang", "Graham Neubig", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick"], "pdf": "/pdf/b040383264bfff0ce2ed87f26c4859dcf3ab59be.pdf", "TL;DR": "We formulate a probabilistic latent sequence model to tackle unsupervised text style transfer, and show its effectiveness across a suite of unsupervised text style transfer tasks. ", "abstract": "We present a deep generative model for unsupervised text style transfer that unifies previously proposed non-generative techniques. Our probabilistic approach models non-parallel data from two domains as a partially observed parallel corpus. By hypothesizing a parallel latent sequence that generates each observed sequence, our model learns to transform sequences from one domain to another in a completely unsupervised fashion. In contrast with traditional generative sequence models (e.g. the HMM), our model makes few assumptions about the data it generates: it uses a recurrent language model as a prior and an encoder-decoder as a transduction distribution. While computation of marginal data likelihood is intractable in this model class, we show that amortized variational inference admits a practical surrogate. Further, by drawing connections between our variational objective and other recent unsupervised style transfer and machine translation techniques, we show how our probabilistic view can unify some known non-generative objectives such as backtranslation and adversarial loss. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of unsupervised style transfer tasks, including sentiment transfer, formality transfer, word decipherment, author imitation, and related language translation. Across all style transfer tasks, our approach yields substantial gains over state-of-the-art non-generative baselines, including the state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation techniques that our approach generalizes. Further, we conduct experiments on a standard unsupervised machine translation task and find that our unified approach matches the current state-of-the-art.", "keywords": ["unsupervised text style transfer", "deep latent sequence model"], "paperhash": "he|a_probabilistic_formulation_of_unsupervised_text_style_transfer", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nHe2020A,\ntitle={A Probabilistic Formulation of Unsupervised Text Style Transfer},\nauthor={Junxian He and Xinyi Wang and Graham Neubig and Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJlA0C4tPS}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/87189857d2f30a28f1761ed3ee5624a2bacb4058.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
