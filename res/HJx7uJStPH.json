We provide a solid experimental comparison of spectrogram methods, Tasnet and Demucs, both with standard source separation metrics and human evaluations.

We made significant updates to the paper to respond to the reviews:\n\n1- We performed several improvements to the model, and updated the corresponding empirical study (increased the number of channels, changed the batch size, and updated the inference procedure using an average over random initial shifts of the song (see Section 4.5). The results are now of 5.6 SDR, while the best previous results on MusDB are 5.3 (see the updated Table 1). You might notice that the validation loss has increased between the two versions, this is because we initially used pytorch DistributedSampler which repeats some of the tracks to make the dataset a multiple of the number of GPUs. This biased the validation loss in the first version of the paper and we fixed that since.\n\n2- We added experiments with Tasnet, as suggested by reviewer 1. Because Tasnet was developed for monophonic source separation with a sampling rate of 8kHz, we had to adapt it to make it work on stereo sampled at 44kHz (which requires increasing the receptive field of the overall network to obtain reasonable performances). With these modifications (described in a new Section 3), Tasnet obtains state-of-the-art SDR of 5.7, slightly better than Demucs. The difference diminishes when adding more training data, as they both obtain 6.3 SDR with 150 additional songs, whereas the previously best reported result on MusDB test set was 6 with 800 additional songs.\n\n3- We performed additional human evaluations between Tasnet and Demucs (trained without additional data) in terms of quality and contamination with other sources. The lower SDR for Demucs is explained by a bit more contamination. On the other hand, Demucs obtains significantly better results in terms of quality. \n\n4- We updated the paper overall to reorganize the discussion on the differences between Demucs and Tasnet instead of the differences between Demucs and Wave-U-Net.\n\n5 - We added the source code to the supplementary material. Pre-trained models are also available for evaluation and can be downloaded on demand from the demucs.separate script. All instructions the README file in the code folder in the ICLR code link. The link will download both the code and audio samples for Demucs, Conv-Tasnet and all the baselines.

In particular, the work considers the task of supervised source separation where the individual target tracks are available during training time. The main contribution of this work is the improvement of an end-to-end waveform-to-waveform separation models through a number of architectural changes that allow such waveform-to-waveform models to perform comparably with other current state-of-the-art methods that instead operate in the spectrogram domain.\n\nOverall, the paper is generally well written and the method is easy to follow. However, I have a couple of concerns about this work, based on which I would rate the work as \u201cweak reject\u201d:\n\n1. The specific architecture proposed in this task does appear to improve performance for this particular task, but it is not clear to me that the conclusions drawn based on the study in this work will be generally applicable to other related tasks. Also, the final model is still only comparable to the spectrogram-based methods overall, and appears to do a slightly worse job in separating the \u2018vocal\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 tracks than these baseline methods. As such, I\u2019m unsure about the impact of this work.\n2. The section describing the evaluation metric SDR wasn\u2019t very clear to me. Perhaps it would be better to just refer back to (Vincent et al., 06) and just describe what SDR captures instead? Or alternatively, more details could be added to explain the computation more clearly.\n3. Section 4.2: The authors mention that they multiply each source by +/- 1. I didn\u2019t follow why this is being done. Could the authors please clarify.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The notation in Equation 1 is slightly confusing because \u2018s\u2019 is used to index both the mixture and the sources. I think x \\in \\mathcal{D} would be clearer. Similarly I wonder if x_s \\in \\mathbb{R}^C \\times \\mathbb{R}^T would be clearer than x_s \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C,T}\n2. The reference (Oord et al., 2017) should be rendered as (van den Oord et al., 2017) \n3. The Figure uses K, and S to denote Kernel Width and stride, but this isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned in the text. Perhaps it would be useful, in Section 3.1 to write: \u201c... convolution with kernel width, K=8, and stride, S=4, ...\u201d or something similar, and updating the caption to explain the notation.\n4. Section 3.2: \u201cThe decoder is almost the symmetric of the encoder\u201d --> \u201cThe decoder is almost the inverse of the encoder\u201d would perhaps be better?\n5. Section 3.2: \u201cThe final layer \u2026 S.C_0 ...\u201d --> \u201cThe final layer \u2026 S * C_0 ...\u201d\n6. The notation in Equation 1 and Equation 2 is slightly inconsistent (lower-case vs. upper-case L for the loss function)\n7.

While end-to-end models that directly generate the waveform are state-of-the-art in many audio synthesis problems, the best multi-instrument source separation models generate masks on the magnitude spectrum and achieve performances far above current end-to-end, waveform-to-waveform models. We present an in-depth analysis of a new architecture, which we will refer to as Demucs, based on a (transposed) convolutional autoencoder, with a bidirectional LSTM at the bottleneck layer and skip-connections as in U-Networks (Ronneberger et al., 2015). Compared to the state-of-the-art waveform-to-waveform model, Wave-U-Net (Stoller et al., 2018), the main features of our approach in addition of the bi-LSTM are the use of trans-posed convolution layers instead of upsampling-convolution blocks, the use of gated linear units, exponentially growing the number of channels with depth and a new careful initialization of the weights.  Results on the MusDB dataset show that our architecture achieves a signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) nearly 2.2 points higher than the best waveform-to-waveform competitor (from 3.2 to 5.4 SDR). This makes our model match the state-of-the-art performances on this dataset, bridging the performance gap between models that operate on the spectrogram and end-to-end approaches.", "code": "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o0gps94s120v7l4/AABS5vDfuuRjgY_zDjdSm_Fsa?dl=1", "keywords": ["source separation", "audio synthesis", "deep learning"], "paperhash": "defossez|music_source_separation_in_the_waveform_domain", "original_pdf": "/attachment/44a21dfb20f452c5eaf86a655e78b08b1a988513.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ndefossez2020music,\ntitle={Music Source Separation in the Waveform Domain},\nauthor={Alexandre Defossez and Nicolas Usunier and Leon Bottou and Francis Bach},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJx7uJStPH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
