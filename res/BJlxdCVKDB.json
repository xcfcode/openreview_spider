The proposed approach can imitate the deep policy better compared with Viper while preserving verifiability. Empirically the proposed method demonstrates improvement in terms of cumulative reward and misprediction rate over Viper in four benchmark tasks.\n\nI tend to reject the paper in its current form because (1) the idea of using mixture of trees to do policy extraction is somewhat incremental; and (2) experiments do not consistently show significant performance gain over the existing approach.\n\n=============================================================================================\n\nNovelty and significance\n\nThe paper addresses an important problem in RL, trying to extract an interpretable and verifiable policy from a deep RL model. The novel aspect of the paper is employing a mixture of expert trees model instead of a single decision tree in Viper. The proposed method is somewhat incremental in the sense that it is equivalent to replacing the first layer of the hard decision tree with a soft decision layer, which enables learning a non-axis-align decision boundaries in the first layer. This is more like a small modification of the original method than a significant contribution.\n\nMoreover, in the experiments, the proposed method does not consistently show significant improvements over Viper. Of course one can expect some improvements over Viper because the proposed method is using more flexible model by employing a soft and non-axis-align decision layer. Besides, for Viper the comparison is not fair because it is comparing with the best performing mixture of expert trees model among many candidate structures. I would like to see how Viper compares with the average performance of different structures. \n\n=============================================================================================\n\nOther comments\n\nThe organization of this paper is good and the paper is easy to read. However the authors can improve the tables and figures by providing more descriptions to be more self-contained. For example, I don't know what the column labels in table 1 (D/R/M/C) are referring to by solely looking at the table. And their actual meanings are really hard to find in the text. And for figure 2, the authors should point out the meaning of colors inside the illustrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Bastani, Osbert, Yewen Pu, and Armando Solar-Lezama. \"Verifiable reinforcement learning via policy extraction.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018.\n\nUpdate after rebuttal: score unchanged\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vasic@utexas.edu", "aapetrovic@mas.bg.ac.rs", "kaiyuanw@google.com", "nikolic@matf.bg.ac.rs", "rising@google.com", "khurshid@ece.utexas.edu"], "title": "MoET: Interpretable and Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Mixture of Expert Trees", "authors": ["Marko Vasic", "Andrija Petrovic", "Kaiyuan Wang", "Mladen Nikolic", "Rishabh Singh", "Sarfraz Khurshid"], "pdf": "/pdf/1e44e1d76a1d5d7f42d73a2565551548785009b3.pdf", "TL;DR": "Explainable reinforcement learning model using novel combination of mixture of experts with non-differentiable decision tree experts.", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has led to many recent breakthroughs on complex control tasks, such as defeating the best human player in the game of Go.

The main objective of this procedure is to obtain an \"interpretable\" and verifiable policy while maintaining the performance of the policy. The authors build over the previously published algorithm Viper (Bastani et al, 2018), which distillates deep policies into a single decision tree using the DAGGER procedures, i.e. alternation of imitation learning of an expert policy and of additional data-sampling from the newly learned policy. In the VIPER algorithm decision trees are chosen because their structured nature allows to formally prove properties of the policy they represent when the environments dynamics are known and expressible in closed form. \n\nThe main contribution of the paper is the adaptation of VIPER to ensembles of trees, specifically to mixtures of experts, and an adaption of the mixture of experts algorithm to non-differentiable experts. The mixture of experts is extended to decision trees with an em-like two step procedures that alternatively trains the experts and their input dependent weighting function. The main reason for extending VIPER to multiple trees is to increase the representation power of the procedure and obtain more faithful approximations of the original policy. The choice of using a input-dependent linear mixture of trees model instead of a more classical aggregation procedure like random-forests or xg-boosts is instead due to the assumed interpretability of input-dependent linear combinations.\n\nThe results in the paper seems to demonstrate comparable or improved performance of MOET over viper, but also show the systematic inability of both methods in imitating the actual neural network policy in all the environments but CARTPOLE. The authors conclude showing that the formal methods proposed to verify the policy in (Bastani et al, 2018) can be extended to MOET as they only rely on the choice of using decision trees as a target model.\n\nOn overall the paper creates a consistent narrative grounded on the notions that decision trees and linear models are interpretable, neural networks are not, individual decision trees can only create limited decision boundaries. The authors frame their technical contribution (em-like training of decision trees mixtures of experts) as necessary for creating more sophisticate decision boundaries through ensembling, while keeping the interpretability of the model (the ensembling method is linear and the components are decision trees).\n\nWhile the narrative is consistent and consequent technical work seems valid the paper has some flaws that put it in my opinion slightly below the acceptance threshold:\n\n1) The notions that linear models and decision trees have the \"interpretable\" propertiy is simply assumed as a known fact in the scientific field, while it is actually a largely discussed point of contention. See as an example \"Lipton 2017, The Mythos of Model Interpretability\". The authors should explain specifically what they mean by interpretability and how the properties of decision trees and linear mixtures of experts are consistent with their definition. \n\n2) On the overall paper (similarly to the narrative used for Viper) the authors speak of interpretability as if it was referred to the original deep neural network model while they only interpret the surrogate model. The lack of a formal definition of interpretable masks the problem of interpreting a model through the interpretation of a surrogate model, which would rely on some proof that links whatever is demonstrated on the surrogate to hold for the original model. \n\n3) The presentation of the results focus on the improvement of MOET with respect to VIPER. As a results it is difficult to compare the performance of both procedures to the original neural network model. For Pong and Acrobot the surrogate models do not achieve comparable performance, nor seems to be good imitations of the original policy, the reasons and the implication of this fact are not discussed.\n\n4) There should be a better connection with the knowledge distillation/model compression literature and in general the important idea that the same computation can be represented by different algorithms. (Born Again Trees, Model Compression, Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network, Policy Distillation, Born Again Neural Networks).  There is also some related novel literature mapping neural network policies and word models to minimal hidden-markov models that could be of interest to the authors (Learning Finite State Representations of Recurrent Policy Networks, Learning Causal State Representations of Partially Observable Environments). \n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vasic@utexas.edu", "aapetrovic@mas.bg.ac.rs", "kaiyuanw@google.com", "nikolic@matf.bg.ac.rs", "rising@google.com", "khurshid@ece.utexas.edu"], "title": "MoET: Interpretable and Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Mixture of Expert Trees", "authors": ["Marko Vasic", "Andrija Petrovic", "Kaiyuan Wang", "Mladen Nikolic", "Rishabh Singh", "Sarfraz Khurshid"], "pdf": "/pdf/1e44e1d76a1d5d7f42d73a2565551548785009b3.pdf", "TL;DR": "Explainable reinforcement learning model using novel combination of mixture of experts with non-differentiable decision tree experts.", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has led to many recent breakthroughs on complex control tasks, such as defeating the best human player in the game of Go.

I'm unsure about the importance of verifying experimentally that it is also the case in the context of DAGGER. \n\nIndeed, it is expected that the mixture of experts model performs better than a single decision tree\u2014this in fact motivates our work. However, there are key challenges in embodying the mixture into a verifiable and interpretable model, which our work shows how to address. To support interpretability we formulate a novel training procedure with decision tree experts. In addition, we show how mixture of experts with hard thresholding can be translated down to SMT to enable verification. To the best of our knowledge, MOET is the first technique to show how to combine decision trees with a mixture of experts, and it is applicable even outside of the RL setting.\n\n> Could you please expand on why using a mixture of experts in the context of DAGGER is challenging? I think that would be an important addition to the paper.\n\nOff-the-shelf mixture of experts models can directly be used with DAGGER without any problem. However, as we pointed out earlier, there was no previous mixture of experts model using the decision tree experts, because of the challenge that decision trees are not differentiable. We defined such a combination in order to construct an interpretable model. More importantly, this combination allowed us to define a translation algorithm that translates a MOET model to an SMT formula, which allows reasoning in logical space. Once translated to SMT, we can verify properties of the model, check for equivalence between two models, verify that agent never loses (assuming we have model of the environment), etc. We will add this discussion to the paper.\n\n> - The notation \"EM\" that appears in the fourth paragraph of the introduction is not defined previously.\n> - There a few typos: e.g., \"there do not exist\"\n\nThanks for pointing this out.

Below we provide answers and clarifications related to the different points made in the review.\n\nAnswer to Point 1:\n\nWe consider interpretability of MOET (and DT) models relative to the deep neural networks. Indeed, Lipton argues that linear models cannot be a priori considered more interpretable than neural networks since they often use heavily engineered features to approach neural networks in performance thus sacrificing decomposability. However, we do not use heavily engineered features and we use simple models. In Lipton's terms, by interpretability we mean transparency, i.e.: 1) simultability, 2) decomposability and partially 3) algorithmic transparency. As noted by Lipton, simultability of decision tree and linear models is preserved because our models are small (2 <= depth <= 10) and we do not use high dimensional features. Similarly, decomposability is preserved because we do not use heavily engineered features. Finally, algorithmic transparency is achieved because MOET relies on DT training for the experts and linear model training for the gate, both of which are well understood. However, transparency is partially achieved because the alternating refinement of initial feature space partitioning and experts makes the procedure more complicated.\n\nMore importantly, as the paper describes we have a well-founded translation of MOET models to SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formulas, which opens a new range of possibilities for interpreting and validating the model using automated reasoning tools. SMT formulas provide a rich means of logical reasoning, where a user can ask the solver questions such as: \u201cOn which inputs do the two models differ?\u201d, or \u201cWhat is the closest input to the given input on which model makes a different prediction?\u201d, or \u201cAre the two models equivalent?\u201d, or \u201cAre the two models equivalent in respect to the output class C?\u201d. Answers to these questions can help better understand and compare models in a rigorous way. Note also our symbolic reasoning of the gating function and decision trees allows us to construct SMT formulas that are readily handled by off-the-shelf tools, whereas direct SMT encodings of neural networks do not scale for any reasonably sized network because of the need for non-linear arithmetic reasoning.\n\nWe will add and emphasize both of these points in the revision.\n\nAnswer to Point 2:\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding here probably caused by our presentation. We do not try/claim to interpret the original neural network model, instead we only use it as a proxy to train an interpretable and verifiable MOET model. This is similar in spirit to Viper, which trains a DT policy not as a means of interpreting the DRL policy via the surrogate DT model, but with a goal of constructing a verifiable policy that can be used directly and achieves acceptable performance. We show that with MOET models we can achieve better performance than Viper while still maintaining verifiability and interpretability of the trained MOET models.\n\nAnswer to Point 3:\n\nOur goal is not to outperform the original policy, rather our goal is to create a verifiable surrogate with acceptable performance. Note that for a fair comparison between MOET and Viper the paper only shows results that are averaged across multiple trained models. In fact, the best performing MOET models achieve the perfect reward for Cartpole and Pong, solve Mountaincar environment, and achieve close to DRL performance on Acrobot. The following table shows the best case performance of MOET models and original agent (averaged across multiple trials as noted in the paper):\n\n                                 DRL         MOET      MOET_h  \n  Cartpole                 200             200              200  \n  Pong                         21               21                 21  \n  Acrobot              -68.60        -73.64          -73.31  \n  Mountaincar   -105.27        -97.57          -97.59\n\nAnswer to Point 4:\n\nThank you for the pointers to the papers. We will add a discussion on these two areas of knowledge distillation and constructing finite state representations of models to our related work section. In summary, the model compression and distillation literature tries to construct student networks that transfer policy or learnt function from a teacher network. But unlike our MOET models, the student networks are still neural networks and therefore less interpretable and more importantly not verifiable. In comparison with learning finite state moore machines, MOET enables learning more hierarchical behaviors because of tree representation and learning complex predicates in a more scalable way.\n\nWe hope our clarifications addresses your concerns, but please let us know if there might be any additional questions or clarifications.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vasic@utexas.edu", "aapetrovic@mas.bg.ac.rs", "kaiyuanw@google.com", "nikolic@matf.bg.ac.rs", "rising@google.com", "khurshid@ece.utexas.edu"], "title": "MoET: Interpretable and Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Mixture of Expert Trees", "authors": ["Marko Vasic", "Andrija Petrovic", "Kaiyuan Wang", "Mladen Nikolic", "Rishabh Singh", "Sarfraz Khurshid"], "pdf": "/pdf/1e44e1d76a1d5d7f42d73a2565551548785009b3.pdf", "TL;DR": "Explainable reinforcement learning model using novel combination of mixture of experts with non-differentiable decision tree experts.", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has led to many recent breakthroughs on complex control tasks, such as defeating the best human player in the game of Go.

Below we provide clarifications and comments on the questions and concerns raised.\n\n> The proposed method is somewhat incremental in the sense that it is equivalent to replacing the first layer of the hard decision tree with a soft decision layer, which enables learning a non-axis-align decision boundaries in the first layer. This is more like a small modification of the original method than a significant contribution.\n\nAlthough the models are related, they cannot be trained in a similar way, therefore the method is significantly modified. Traditional mixture of experts model is defined for differentiable experts. Unfortunately, decision trees are not differentiable, and in this paper we present an algorithm that adapts mixture of experts training to support decision tree experts. To the best of our knowledge, MOET is the first technique to show how to combine decision trees with a mixture of experts, and it is applicable even outside of the RL setting.\n\n> the proposed method does not consistently show significant improvements over Viper. Of course one can expect some improvements over Viper because the proposed method is using more flexible model by employing a soft and non-axis-align decision layer. \n\nMOET generalizes Viper, and the experiments show that MOET performs consistently better than Viper. For example, the motivation section illustrates a case where MOET is significantly better than Viper. Indeed, we do not expect that to always be the case.\n\n> Besides, for Viper the comparison is not fair because it is comparing with the best performing mixture of expert trees model among many candidate structures. I would like to see how Viper compares with the average performance of different structures. \n\nIndeed, for a given depth, MOET allows multiple ways to configure the model by alternating number of individual decision trees and their depth. For fair comparison, for both Viper and MOET we train 10 different models for each configuration (structure), and average results across them. Only after averaging we choose the best performing MOET model for a given effective depth and compare it to Viper.\n\nWe have now also computed the average MOET performance across different configurations and we show them below. As can be observed MOET outperforms Viper in majority of cases even when averaged across different configurations. We will also add this in the revision.\n\n\ufeff                 Viper                       MOET                   MOET_h\nD           R           M              R             M            R               M\n                                         Cartpole\n1      181.76    30.43%\n2      200.00    16.65%    200.00      0.84%    200.00       0.91%\n3      200.00    11.04%    200.00      0.87%    200.00       0.84%\n4      200.00      6.87%    200.00      1.01%    200.00       0.96%\n5      200.00      5.89%    200.00      1.16%    200.00       1.17%\n                                           Pong\n4         -6.35    76.50%        3.03    74.48%        3.08     75.18%\n6        11.01    70.74%      14.92    71.49%      12.66     72.59%\n8        15.96    68.12%      18.50    64.74%      17.99     65.94%\n10      20.57    59.35%      20.66    55.67%      20.29     52.81%\n                                         Acrobat\n2       -86.17    19.83%     -82.47    20.50%    -81.70     19.18%\n3       -83.40    19.68%     -82.45    19.34%    -81.79     19.52%\n4       -82.64    20.17%     -82.36    17.61%    -81.52     17.37%\n5       -81.99    17.41%     -82.44    16.16%    -83.57     17.44%\n                                     Mountaincar\n2     -119.07    35.09%   -105.53    21.35%  -107.15     22.85%\n3     -109.82    24.12%   -101.57    12.62%  -101.68     12.42%\n4     -103.53      9.19%   -100.83    10.12%  -100.96     10.03%\n5     -102.64      7.67%   -101.06      8.03%  -100.69       7.73%\n\nR - rewards, M - mispredictions, D - depth (effective depth in a case of MOET)\n\n > However the authors can improve the tables and figures by providing more descriptions to be more self-contained.

The decision trees are learnt by imitation learning (DAGGER) and are guided by a DNN policy (called the oracle) and its Q-function. The paper is an extension of VIPER to mixture of Experts.\n\nThe paper does two contributions:\n- the modification of Viper to learn a mixture of decision tree policies that better mimics the DRL agent, and\n- the fact that the model based on Mixture of Experts is still interpretable.\n\nForm my understanding, it is known that mixture of experts can be more accurate than a single decision tree. I'm unsure about the importance of verifying experimentally that it is also the case in the context of DAGGER. Could you please expand on why using a mixture of experts in the context of DAGGER is challenging? I think that would be an important addition to the paper. That being said, the experimental results are of interest as they bring interpretability and verifiable RL to more challenging environments.\n\nMinor comments:\n- The notation \"EM\" that appears in the fourth paragraph of the introduction is not defined previously.\n- There a few typos: e.g., \"there do not exist\"\n- How many seeds are used for the \"average results (e.g. Appendix E)?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1199/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vasic@utexas.edu", "aapetrovic@mas.bg.ac.rs", "kaiyuanw@google.com", "nikolic@matf.bg.ac.rs", "rising@google.com", "khurshid@ece.utexas.edu"], "title": "MoET: Interpretable and Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Mixture of Expert Trees", "authors": ["Marko Vasic", "Andrija Petrovic", "Kaiyuan Wang", "Mladen Nikolic", "Rishabh Singh", "Sarfraz Khurshid"], "pdf": "/pdf/1e44e1d76a1d5d7f42d73a2565551548785009b3.pdf", "TL;DR": "Explainable reinforcement learning model using novel combination of mixture of experts with non-differentiable decision tree experts.", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has led to many recent breakthroughs on complex control tasks, such as defeating the best human player in the game of Go.
