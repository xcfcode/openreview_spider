The motivation for WaveVAE is that the model can be trained from scratch without requiring a two-stage knowledge distillation (pre-training an autoregressive teacher model and then distilling a student model from it). That means the encoder and decoder in WaveVAE will be trained jointly which simplifies the training process. We use IAF as the decoder in WaveVAE.\n\n2.

Our response is as follows.\n\n1. We agree that the simultaneous work on the same topic doesn\u2019t undermines the fundamentals of each work. Indeed, it demonstrates the wide interest & practical importance of the topic. We didn't discuss the simultaneous work in related work, because it would encourage searching on arXiv (e.g., for checking the simultaneousness) and hurt anonymous review process. We would like to discuss them in the final draft.\n\n2. The main advantage of WaveVAE over ClariNet is that WaveVAE can be trained from scratch without knowledge distillation, which largely simplifies both the training process and the model development. In comparison, ClariNet requires a two-stage training process, where the authors first pretrain an autoregressive teacher model and then distill a student model from it.  Although WaveVAE still performs worse than ClariNet vocoder, we believe it is an interesting endeavor.  In particular, it is very challenging to model raw audio with VAE using non-autoregressive decoder because of the over-smoothing issue.  The vanilla implementation couldn't even produce intelligible speech. \n\n3.  We tried a long time tuning the WaveGlow model on our internal dataset. But there are still constant high-frequency noises present in the synthesized speech. To remedy this, we applied the denoising function with strength 0.1 in the open source repository. The denoising function is effective when the predicted mel spectrograms are from DV3, but not quite effective when the predicted mel spectrograms are from ParaNet. These noises have a huge impact on the MOS evaluation results, which is the major reasons for the MOS score gap between DV3 + WaveGlow and ParaNet + WaveGlow.\n\n4.  We didn\u2019t claim the proposed model is \u201cend-to-end\u201d in our paper. Even without the attention distillation, it is still not end-to-end training, because it involves the separate training of text-to-spectrogram model and neural vocoder. But we agree that the comparison between traditional alignment model and attention distillation could be interesting. \nNote that, the traditional front end usually uses RNN or autoregressive model to predict phoneme duration and fundamental frequency, thus it is not parallel at frame-level (e.g., typically ~200 frames per second) during synthesis.  In contrast, ParaNet generates spectrogram frames in parallel, and feed them to parallel IAF vocoder. Thus, ParaNet + IAF vocoder should be considered as \u201cmore parallel\u201d than Parallel WaveNet."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1045/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1045/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Parallel Neural Text-to-Speech", "authors": ["Kainan Peng", "Wei Ping", "Zhao Song", "Kexin Zhao"], "authorids": ["pengkainan@baidu.com", "weiping.thu@gmail.com", "zhaosong02@baidu.com", "zhaokexin01@baidu.com"], "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "non-autoregressive model", "parallel decoding"], "abstract": "In this work, we first propose ParaNet, a non-autoregressive seq2seq model that converts text to spectrogram.

In particular, it looks at the problem of efficient training and inference. Many current state-of-the-art approaches in the area employ an autoregressive component at one or another part of text-to-speech model making training and/or inference complicated/slow. The main idea behind this paper is to remove autoregressive components. \n\nI believe there is a great deal of interest for efficient and fast text-to-speech. I believe stirring more interest towards non-autoregressive approaches is the right direction. I believe that the approach proposed does indeed accomplish the task of removing autoregressive components from the text-to-speech model. I find however that the results with parallel neural vocoders for the proposed approach to lag behind (autoregressive) Deep Voice 3 with the same set of vocoders even though when an autoregressive vocoder is used the situation is different. \n\nI find that the presentation of this work to be lacking a balance. This work makes 2 contributions 1) non-autoregressive text-to-spectrogram and 2) non-autoregressive spectrogram-to-speech model. \n\n The first contribution is presented in a completely verbal manner to describe the complex process of text-to-speech mapping.

The backbone can either be an RNN or a wavenet style model (autoregressive). Synthesizing audio from the feature representation (mel spectrogram) by a neural vocoder is usually an autoregressive model from the wavenet family. \n\nIn the current work, the main novelties seem to be the following:\n\n1) Replace the autoregressive component in the decoder (seemingly inspired by DeepVoice3) with a non-autoregressive model. This could be very advantageous because synthesis in autoregressive models can be quite slow owing to the sample level generations (and to overcome this defect, faster sampling with inverse autoregressive flows has been used in parallel wavenet, clarinet, etc. and probability density distillation). Here, if I can interpret the paper correctly, the authors use a trained attention model (autoregressive), to distill attention for the non-autoregressive setup used, which would otherwise have difficulties learning alignment. The paper claims speed up of ~50X over DeepVoice 3 which is very significant.\n\n2) In the mel to audio converter (vocoder), the proposal is a VAE Wavenet, with appropriate modifications for the sequence modeling. The authors mention that there are similarities to the approach used in Clarinet (this has a closed form KLD between the distilled distributions, which makes things easy). \n\nExperiments: It is mentioned that poor attention alignments are the cause of many issues in these architectures (repeats, mispronunciations, skipped words, etc.), and they go on to show that their architecture fares well as regards these metrics, while maintaining a comparable MOS score with DeepVoice3+Wavenet. \n\nEvaluations: I am reasonably convinced by the audio demos provided. \n\nMy thoughts: \nThe paper is generally a good addition to the TTS literature. These are difficult to implement, brittle setups, and a practitioner could spend a lot of time debugging their broken attention curves. To that end, I feel that any technique that throws light into the modeling process would be useful for the practitioner. It is suggested that we can use a non-autoregressive model with speedups. Likewise, they also use a wavenet VAE, which they claim can be trained without distillation (could the authors please clarify this point?)\n\nI do, however, feel that the paper has a few drawbacks. \n\n1) The presentation is not at all clear. This is a very subjective comment, but I feel that this work might be unreadable to someone who hasn't studied the literature (starting from Tacotron, DeepVoice 1, 2, 3, wavenet, parallel wavenet, transformer, distillation, etc.). Furthermore, the paper does not seem to make things any clearer with succinct architecture diagrams. Just as a comparison, I would like to draw attention to Tacotron (1, 2) in which I think the details can actually be worked out with some effort. \n\n2) Why are we using the WaveVAE - is this just to do away with the probability distillation in wavenet? Are we also using the  IAF setup as described in Kingma's work?\n\n3) I really feel that we need more architecture diagrams for this work to be useful. That being said, the authors do provide a list of hyperparameters for potential use. \n\n4) Distilling attention seems to require a previously trained autoregressive attention model. What if we don't have one ready at hand?\n\nIn summary, while I see that the work will definitely be useful to the Speech Synthesis practitioner, the clarity of the paper could be improved and we need a few more diagrams (maybe even code) to make it implementable.

FastSpeech is one that was noted in public comment.  I have seen other work under submission as well.  I don't believe this undermines the fundamentals of the work, but it will color claims of being \"first\" by each submission.\n\nWaveVAE is an interesting approach to a parallel neural vocoding.  However it performs works than the IAF distilled ClariNet parallel vocoder with the same amount of parameters.  It is not clear what advantages WaveVAE has over ClariNet.\n\nMore problematic, ParaNet is described as providing a speedup over Deep Voice while maintaining quality.  However, this claim is somewhat misleading.  The maintained quality is only achieved when using an autoregressive wavenet vocoder.  It appears as though the inference speed up is only measured on the feature to mel conversion, while the wall-clock inference time is (likely) dominated by wavenet inference (a notoriously computationally intensive process).  When evaluated with parallel vocoders (ClariNet, WaveVAE or WaveGlow) ParaNet performs quite poorly when compared to Deep Voice 3. (This is especially true when using WaveGlow -- the best performing vocoder for DV3 MOS=3.96, ParaNet MOS=3.21).  While there are fewer attention errors (cf. Table 2) this doesn't seem to impact MOS to a great degree.\n\nAttention Distillation is somewhat equivalent to using an external alignment or duration model as is done in classical TTS.  Requiring this external resource somewhat undermines the claim of being an \"end-to-end\" TTS system.  It is worth comparing attention distillation to, say, training a traditional alignment model based on forced alignment and feeding the target durations as a conditioning feature along with the text.  This is what ParallelWaveNet (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10433.pdf) does.  From that perspective it is not clear why ParaNet+neural vocoder should be considered as \"more parallel\" than ParallelWaveNet or other IAF vocoding approaches paired with a traditional front end."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1045/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1045/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Parallel Neural Text-to-Speech", "authors": ["Kainan Peng", "Wei Ping", "Zhao Song", "Kexin Zhao"], "authorids": ["pengkainan@baidu.com", "weiping.thu@gmail.com", "zhaosong02@baidu.com", "zhaokexin01@baidu.com"], "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "non-autoregressive model", "parallel decoding"], "abstract": "In this work, we first propose ParaNet, a non-autoregressive seq2seq model that converts text to spectrogram.

In their paper, they describe a model for parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Below is their abstract:\n\n\"\"\"Neural network based end-to-end text to speech (TTS) has significantly improved the quality of synthesized speech. Prominent methods (e.g., Tacotron 2) usually first generate mel-spectrogram from text, and then synthesize speech from mel-spectrogram using vocoder such as WaveNet. Compared with traditional concatenative and statistical parametric approaches, neural network based end-to-end models suffer from slow inference speed, and the synthesized speech is usually not robust (i.e., some words are skipped or repeated) and lack of controllability (voice speed or prosody control). In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward network based on Transformer to generate mel-spectrogram in parallel for TTS. Specifically, we extract attention alignments from an encoder-decoder based teacher model for phoneme duration prediction, which is used by a length regulator to expand the source phoneme sequence to match the length of target mel-spectrogram sequence for parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Experiments on the LJSpeech dataset show that our parallel model matches autoregressive models in terms of speech quality, nearly eliminates the problem of word skipping and repeating in particularly hard cases, and can adjust voice speed smoothly. Most importantly, compared with autoregressive Transformer TTS, our model speeds up the mel-spectrogram generation by 270x and the end-to-end speech synthesis by 38x.\"\"\"", "title": "Related work"}, "signatures": ["~Rafael_Valle1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["~Rafael_Valle1", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Parallel Neural Text-to-Speech", "authors": ["Kainan Peng", "Wei Ping", "Zhao Song", "Kexin Zhao"], "authorids": ["pengkainan@baidu.com", "weiping.thu@gmail.com", "zhaosong02@baidu.com", "zhaokexin01@baidu.com"], "keywords": ["text-to-speech", "non-autoregressive model", "parallel decoding"], "abstract": "In this work, we first propose ParaNet, a non-autoregressive seq2seq model that converts text to spectrogram.

It is fully convolutional and obtains 46.7 times speed-up over Deep Voice 3 at synthesis while maintaining comparable speech quality using a WaveNet vocoder. ParaNet also produces stable alignment between text and speech on the challenging test sentences by iteratively improving the attention in a layer-by-layer manner. Based on ParaNet, we build the first fully parallel neural text-to-speech system using parallel neural vocoders, which can synthesize speech from text through a single feed-forward pass.  We investigate several parallel vocoders within the TTS system, including variants of IAF vocoders and bipartite flow vocoder.", "pdf": "/pdf/c00381604774c92ff1d4ab793a533b5d1457c375.pdf", "paperhash": "peng|parallel_neural_texttospeech", "original_pdf": "/attachment/c00381604774c92ff1d4ab793a533b5d1457c375.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\npeng2020parallel,\ntitle={Parallel Neural Text-to-Speech},\nauthor={Kainan Peng and Wei Ping and Zhao Song and Kexin Zhao},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeFQ0NtPS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"required": true, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).
