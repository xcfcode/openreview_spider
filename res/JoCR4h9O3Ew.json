The method uses **multi-view**-learning (as in using multiple models with different parameters to cast their votes/views on a given sample), semi-supervised learning to pseudo-label new data based on a consensus, and a diversity regularizer. The approach is evaluated in CIFAR-10 and SVHN against recent baselines in the presence of white-box attacks. The results yield by ARMOURED in these scenarios are superior.\n \n---\n \n### **Reasons for score**: \n \nMy recommendation is to accept the paper. I like the proposal, it is simple yet is able to produce better results than existing methods. It also performs well with clean samples, which is something that many other methods struggle with. The only thing I miss is to see experiments in ImageNet.  \n \n---\n### **Strengths**:\n \n* The problem is relevant for the community and the proposed approach seems to do a better job than the existing state-of-the-art leveraging weak-supervision/semi-supervision (definitely a plus). \n* The method is simple and seems easy to adapt to other architectures and tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses**:\n\n* The ablation experiments point to the unlabelled data as one of the core reasons for the method to work.

As a consequence, the final models achieve near state-of-the-art adversarial robustness, without explicitly generating them during its training process. Based on experiments on the CIFAR10 and SVHN classification tasks, the proposed technique produces models that maintain accuracy on clean as well as adversarially perturbed data.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score:\n\nThe proposed regularization terms of using unlabeled data and an ensemble of models with different views to indirectly promote adversarial robustness are quite interesting. However, the absence of evaluation against an adaptive adversary, along with signs of gradient masking makes this work in its current form not ready for publication. If the authors can run tests with an appropriately designed adaptive adversary, along with stronger evaluations (including gradient-free and black-box adversaries), and if the model performs well under those settings, the proposed work would be qualified to be part of the conference proceedings. \n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n\n- The idea of increasing inter-model diversity to decrease transferability between models is a very interesting concept. The fact that it leads to better robustness without explicitly training for it shows that the authors' intuition in using this regularization term is, in fact, sound.\n\n- Using the idea that augmented images are distorted views of the same image and thus their deep views should agree is great! However, I must point out that the idea of using augmentations to enforce consistency on unlabeled data is now new. One example of such work is [Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12848.pdf). Please cite this (and/or relevant work) and do include a comparison.\n\n- Using the concept of a stable sample (based on consensus) is great, since it might help filter out noisy labels.  \n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\n- Since this is primarily a paper that focuses on adversarial robustness (ultimately), I feel some very basic yet important changes are required. In general, the authors could follow the advice in the paper [On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06705.pdf). To be a bit more concrete, I would recommend having at least the following:\n  - Using FGSM to evaluate is not recommended, since it is not nearly as strong an attack as something like PGD. Instead, I would recommend swapping FGSM evaluation with a black-box attack like Boundary++, or some perturbation-minimizing attack like C&W \n  - Since the final model is trained using a combination of loss functions and non-trivial processes, it might be beneficial to run evaluations against an adaptive adversary. Space could be made for it by shifting to Figure 3 to supplementary material.\n\n- Is there any particular reason for skipping augmentation at inference time?\n\n- The part that involves using proper class-level information to incorporate it in the DPP regularizer seems similar to work that uses cost-functions to differentiate between different classes when working with adversarial inputs. One such work is [Cost-Sensitive Robustness against Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09225). It might be worthwhile to talk about and compare the matrices used in the experiments with the matrices used in this work.\n\n- Although the models do theoretically possess similar learning capabilities, it might be interesting to see if different models end up being more \"contributing\" than others in their predictions. Maybe some analysis might reveal that some augmentations/models are much more useful than the rest (which could be used for pruning), or perhaps trends like 'some models help with clean accuracy, while others help with robustness'. If space/time permits, it would be nice to have such analyses (perhaps in additional materials).\n\n- It has been observed in the literature that the performance of PGD attacks is significantly degraded when random restarts are not used. In your experiments, please run them with random-restarts and report numbers.\n\n- Tables 1&2 have '+-' numbers with them. Why are they there? Are these numbers accuracy, or error rates? Were the attacks run multiple times? If yes, how many? Also, are those numbers s.d? Please clarify.\n\n- The use of unlabeled data along in this case, along with multiple models to have an ensemble effect, seems to be somewhat related to this work [A2-LINK](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9104705).

However, I am slightly worried by the ablation study results -- from Table 3, it seems like the DPP component of the loss does not provide a statistically significant lift. \n\n## Clarity\nThis paper is very clearly written! The choice of parameterization, experiment settings, and overall proposed methodology were clearly explained and motivated.\n\n## Originality\nAs the authors have mentioned, improving diversity in ensembles is not a novel approach to improving robustness to adversarial attacks; the originality of the method lies in the parameterization of diversity through a DPP component and multi-view complementarity. \n\n## Significance\nImproving robustness to adversarial attacks is in of itself an important contribution to this field. This paper proposes a method that achieves a significant improvement over other competitors (Tables 1, 2); the proposed method is additionally intuitive, and can incorporate prior beliefs over the the data distribution, making it adaptable to several different settings.\n\n## Questions\n### Methodology\nMy main question lies in the uses of the DPP loss: did the authors use the determinant directly? Depending on the choice of kernel, I would expect the determinant portion of the loss to eclipse the other terms, potentially hampering learning. \n\nOn a related note, I am curious to know how sensitive the ARMOURED performance is to the $\\lambda_{DPP}$ and $\\lambda_{NEM}$ hyper-parameters.\n\n### Experiments\nDo the authors have insight in the significant gap between ARMOURED-B and its variants for a large $\\epsilon$ budget with $L_\\infty$ PGD? I am surprised by the significant gap in Table 3.\n\nAgain in Table 3, comparing the -F, no DPP, and -B variants, it seems like the highest lift in performance comes from the diversity in the NEM component. Do you know if a similar lift is observed by removing the NEM component and keeping the DPP? \n\nAt inference time, you state that the augmentation step is skipped. Naively, I would not have been surprised to see these augmentations improve resilience to adversarial attacks.

With this revision (rev_1), we would like to address the following issues:\n\n> ... it might be beneficial to run evaluations against an adaptive adversary. ... strong hints at some form of gradient masking in the final model. ... Most importantly, it is crucial to have evaluation against stronger attacks as well as an adaptive adversary, before claims of robustness can be substantiated. \n\nWe have evaluated the proposed method against stronger adversaries, including Auto-PGD, FAB, Square, and AutoAttack. Please refer to subsection 4.3 of this revision (rev_1), note that the ARMOURED method now includes random augmentation during inference. Experiment results in Table 4 show that ARMOURED-F is robust against FAB and Square, which suggests that gradient-masking is less likely to exists in the final model. ARMOURED-F also yield the highest clean accuracy among all competing methods. However, it is much more vulnerable to APGD, and especially AutoAttack.\n\nOn a side note, we found that the original implementation of ARMOURED-F (without augmentation during inference) is robust to $\\ell_2$ AutoAttack for small epsilon budgets. For $\\ell_2$ attacks with $\\epsilon = 0.1$, original ARMOURED-F achieves 74.12%, 64.07%, 60.18% and 60.18% robust accuracies against the sequence of attacks APGD-CE, APGD-T, FAB-T then Square (the AutoAttack sequence). Meanwhile, ARG achieves 62.56%, 62.18%, 62.18% and 62.18% robust accuracies against the same sequence of attacks. While achieving comparable robustness, the clean accuracy of ARMOURED-F is significantly higher at 86.06% versus 66.82% for ARG. \n\nTherefore, we believe that ARMOURED-F alone nonetheless confers some amount of robustness while significantly improving accuracy on clean samples. We further notice that multi-view diversity is an orthogonal approach to adversarial training (AT), and that stronger defenses always rely on AT. Thus, we decide to combine ARMOURED with AT. We propose a variant of ARMOURED-F with adversarial training, namely ARMOURED-F+AT. This model shows strong resilience against all adversaries: its performance asymptotes the state-of-the-art robustness against AutoAttack, and it substantially outperforms other benchmarks against APGD, FAB and Square attacks. \n\nWe are thinking about developing this new ARMOURED with Adversarial Training concept as one of the main contributions. We also understand that such a fundamental change at this point may give rise to great uncertainties. Thus, we would like to seek the reviewer\u2019s advice regarding this matter. \n\n> Is there any particular reason for skipping augmentation at inference time?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for raising this question. We have made changes to the ARMOURED method to include random augmentation during inference. This change has improved the performance of ARMOURED and has been updated in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of rev_1.\n\n> The part that involves using proper class-level information to incorporate it in the DPP regularizer seems similar to work that uses cost-functions to differentiate between different classes when working with adversarial inputs. \n\nThe cost-sensitive robustness paper presents an interesting idea to encode adversarial-cost information onto different classes. However, our DPP kernel works by encoding similarity information between classes, and may not be directly comparable to cost matrices. We still thank the reviewer for bringing this up.\n\n> In your experiments, please run them with random-restarts and report numbers.\n\nWe are implementing multiple restarts for PGD attacks. We will update our results accordingly in a future revision.\n\n> Tables 1&2 have '+-' numbers with them. ... Please clarify.\n\nEach result in our tables include the mean and standard deviation over three runs with different random seeds for selecting labeled samples.\n\n> The use of unlabeled data along in this case, along with multiple models to have an ensemble effect, seems to be somewhat related to this work A2-LINK.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The A2-LINK method applies a Mean Teacher-based framework and uses adversarial training to generate covariates. The ideas presented in this work are promising, and will be considered for our future work.\n\n> Typos/Minor edits:\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out these mistakes. We have made changes accordingly in this revision (rev_1).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper745/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper745/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ARMOURED: Adversarially Robust MOdels using Unlabeled data by REgularizing Diversity", "authorids": ["~Kangkang_Lu1", "~Cuong_Manh_Nguyen1", "~Xun_Xu1", "~Kiran_Chari1", "~Yu_Jing_Goh1", "~Chuan-Sheng_Foo1"], "authors": ["Kangkang Lu", "Cuong Manh Nguyen", "Xun Xu", "Kiran Chari", "Yu Jing Goh", "Chuan-Sheng Foo"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness", "Semi-supervised Learning", "Multi-view Learning", "Diversity Regularization", "Entropy Maximization"], "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose a major challenge for modern deep neural networks.

We would like to answer some of your questions with this revision (rev_1). The remaining questions will be addressed in a future revision:\n\n> My main question lies in the uses of the DPP loss: did the authors use the determinant directly?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for bringing this up. Our DPP loss never uses the determinant directly. Instead, a log function is applied to the determinant term. This practice was originally proposed by the ADP method. In our original submission, there was a typo in the DPP equation. We have fixed the DPP loss in section 3 of rev_1.\n\n> Do the authors have insight in the significant gap between ARMOURED-B and its variants for a large $\\epsilon$  budget with $L_\\infty$ PGD?\n\nThe high performance of ARMOURED-B on large-epsilon PGD attacks was also questioned by another reviewer and was suspected to gradient-masking. We are investigating this issue and will provide an update in the next revision.\n\n>  Do you know if a similar lift is observed by removing the NEM component and keeping the DPP?\n\nThis is a good question. Because there exist trivial solutions to the DPP loss function, removing the NEM component completely will cause numerical issues. This phenomenon has been studied in the ADP paper.\n\n> Naively, I would not have been surprised to see these augmentations improve resilience to adversarial attacks. Am I incorrect?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have made changes to the ARMOURED method to include random augmentation during inference. This change has improved the performance of ARMOURED and has been updated in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of rev_1.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper745/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper745/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ARMOURED: Adversarially Robust MOdels using Unlabeled data by REgularizing Diversity", "authorids": ["~Kangkang_Lu1", "~Cuong_Manh_Nguyen1", "~Xun_Xu1", "~Kiran_Chari1", "~Yu_Jing_Goh1", "~Chuan-Sheng_Foo1"], "authors": ["Kangkang Lu", "Cuong Manh Nguyen", "Xun Xu", "Kiran Chari", "Yu Jing Goh", "Chuan-Sheng Foo"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness", "Semi-supervised Learning", "Multi-view Learning", "Diversity Regularization", "Entropy Maximization"], "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose a major challenge for modern deep neural networks.

The major updates in Revision 1 (rev_1) are as follows:\n\n* A common question was whether augmentation would help during inference. We have tried adding random augmentation and found that it improves the robustness of ARMOURED. Thus, we have made changes to the ARMOURED inference procedure in the methodology section itself (c1). Another concern is regarding adding random initialization for PGD $\\ell_\\infty$, because our original PGD $\\ell_\\infty$ implementation started from the clean sample. We have fixed this issue. Now, both PGD $\\ell_\\infty$ and PGD $\\ell_2$ start from a randomly perturbed sample (c2). Both changes (c1) and (c2) have been applied to create new results for Tables 1, 2 and 3. The overall trends and observations from these results have also been updated.\n\n* A critical request is to evaluate ARMOURED against stronger attacks, including adaptive attacks and black-box attacks. To address this, we conducted a new experiment in subsection 4.3 to evaluate against Auto-PGD (better convergence than PGD), FAB (white-box perturbation-minimization attack), Square (black-box attack) and AutoAttack (ensemble attack). The results in Table 4 suggest that (i) ARMOURED-F achieved highest clean accuracy (by 10%-15% margin), (ii) gradient-masking does not develop in the ARMOURED-F model, evident by its high robustness against FAB and Square, and (iii) when combined with Adversarial Training, ARMOURED-F approaches state-of-the-art robustness against AutoAttack, and outperforms other benchmarks against APGD, FAB and Square attacks.\n\nWe are considering revising the paper towards ARMOURED with Adversarial Training and would appreciate any further feedback. Due to time and resource limits, we have prioritized key concerns; nonetheless we will continue to address any further and remaining issues over the rest of the discussion period. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper745/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper745/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ARMOURED: Adversarially Robust MOdels using Unlabeled data by REgularizing Diversity", "authorids": ["~Kangkang_Lu1", "~Cuong_Manh_Nguyen1", "~Xun_Xu1", "~Kiran_Chari1", "~Yu_Jing_Goh1", "~Chuan-Sheng_Foo1"], "authors": ["Kangkang Lu", "Cuong Manh Nguyen", "Xun Xu", "Kiran Chari", "Yu Jing Goh", "Chuan-Sheng Foo"], "keywords": ["Adversarial Robustness", "Semi-supervised Learning", "Multi-view Learning", "Diversity Regularization", "Entropy Maximization"], "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose a major challenge for modern deep neural networks.
