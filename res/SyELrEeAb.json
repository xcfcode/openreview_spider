The model can be viewed as a variant of Structural Equation Model. Overal the paper is interesting and relatively well-written but some important details are missing and way more experiments need to be done to show the effectiveness of the approach.\n\n*  How do the authors call a variant to be associated with the phenotype (y)? More specifically, what is the distribution of the null hypothesis? Section D.3 in the appendix does not explain the hypothesis testing part well. This method models $x$ (genetic), $y$ (phenotype), and $z$ (confounder) but does not have a latent variable for the association. For example, there is no latent indicator variable (e.g., Spike-Slab models [1]) for each variant.  Did they do hypothesis testing separately after they fit the model? If so, this has double dipping problem because the data is used once to fit the model and again to perform statistical inference. \n\n* In GWAS, a method resulting in high power with control of FP is favored. In traditional univariate GWAS, the false positive rate is controlled by genome-wide significant level (7e-8), Bonferroni correction or other FP control approaches.  Why Table 1 does not report FP? I need Table 1 to report the following: What is the power of this method if FPR is controlled(False Positive Rate < 0.05)? Also, the ROC curve for FPR<0.05 should be reported for all methods. \n\n* I believe that authors did a good job in term of a survey of the available models for GWA from marginal regression to mixed effect model, etc. The authors account for typical confounders such as cryptic relatedness which I liked. However, I recommend the authors to be cautious calling the association detected by their method \" a Causal Association.\" There are tons of research done to understand the causal effect of the genetic variants and this paper (and this venue) is not addressing those.  There are several ways for an associated variant to be non-causal and this paper does not even scratch the surface of that. For example, in many studies, discovering the causal SNPs means finding a genetic variant among the SNPs in LD of each other (so-called fine mapping). The LD-pruning procedure proposed in this paper does not help for that purpose. \n\n* This approach jointly models the genetic variants and the phenotype (y). Let us assume that one can directly maximize the ML (ELBO maximizes a lower bound of ML). The objective function is disproportionally influenced by the genetic variants (x) than y because M is very large (  $\\prod_{m=1}^M p(w) p(x|z,w,\\phi)   >>   p(z) p(y|x,z,\\theta) $  ). Effectively, the model focuses on the genetic variants, not by the disease. This is why multi-variate GWAS focuses on the conditional p(y|x,z) and not p(y,x,z). Nothing was shown in the paper that this focusing on p(y,x,z) is advantageous to p(y|x,z). \n\n* In this paper, the authors use deep neural networks to model the general functional causal models. Since estimation of the causal effects is generally unidentifiable (Sprites 1993), I think using a general functional causal model with confounder modeling would have a larger chance to weaken the causal effects because the confounder part can also explain part of the causal influences. Is there a theoretical guarantee for the proposed method? Practically, how did the authors control the model complexity to avoid trivial solutions?\n\nMinor\n-------\n* The idea of representing (conditional) densities by neural networks was proposed in the generative adversarial networks (GAN). In this paper, the authors represent the functional causal models by neural networks, which is very related to the representation used in GANs. The only difference is that GAN does not specify a causal interpretation.

To solve the first problem this paper effectively suggests learning the latent confounders jointly with the rest of the model. For the second problem, this paper proposes \u201cimplicit causal models\u2019, that is, models that  leverage neural architectures with an implicit density. \n\nThe main contribution of this paper is to create a bridge between the statistical genetics community and the ML community. The method is technically sound and does indeed generalize techniques currently used in statistical genetics. The main concerns with this paper is that 1) the claim that it can detect epistatic interactions is not really supported. Yes, in principle the neural model used to model y could detect them, but no experiments are shown to really tease this case apart 2) validating GWAS results is really hard, because no causal information is usually available. The authors did a great job on the simulation framework, but table 1 falls short in terms of evaluation metric: to properly assess the performance of the method on simulated data, it would be good to have evidence that the type 1 error is calibrated (e.g. by means of qq plots vs null distribution) for all methods. At the very least, a ROC curve could be used to show the quality of the ranking of the causal SNPs for each method, irrespective of p-value cutoff.\n\nQuality: see above. The technical parts of this paper are definitely high-quality, the experimental side could be improved.\nClarity: if the target audience of this paper is the probabilistic ML community, it\u2019s very clear. If the statistical genetics community is expected to read this, section 3.1 could result too difficult to parse. As an aside: ICLR might be the right venue for this paper given the high ML content, but perhaps a bioinformatics journal would be a better fit, depending on intended audience.\n", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implicit Causal Models for Genome-wide Association Studies", "abstract": "Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference.

We added these limitations and notes in the revision. In short, we agree guaranteeing real-world causation has myriads of complexity. For example, the discussion now includes future work to incorporate linkage disequilibrium and the granularity of SNP loci.\n\n> * [...] Effectively, the model focuses on the genetic variants, not by the disease. This is why multi-variate GWAS focuses on the conditional p(y|x,z) and not p(y,x,z). Nothing was shown in the paper that this focusing on p(y,x,z) is advantageous to p(y|x,z).\n\nThis might be a misunderstanding: we also focus on the conditional, as the goal is to infer parameters from p(y | x). We only use the joint p(y, x, z) to adjust for population-confounders, and which is similar to common techniques in GWAS. The paragraph below Eq 4 describes that like two-stage estimation, the method can be thought of as first inferring p(z | x, y); then it infers parameters in p(y | x, z), drawn over posterior samples of z.\n\n> * [...] Since estimation of the causal effects is generally unidentifiable (Sprites 1993), I think using a general functional causal model with confounder modeling would have a larger chance to weaken the causal effects because the confounder part can also explain part of the causal influences. Is there a theoretical guarantee for the proposed method? Practically, how did the authors control the model complexity to avoid trivial solutions?\n\nProposition 1 provides a consistency guarantee, rendering the adjustment for latent confounders valid in observational data (assuming the causal graph is correct).  In practice, the number of latent dimension in the confounder reduces to typical probabilistic modeling with latent variable models, precisely like the number of latent factors in PCA (Price et al., 2006) and logistic factor analysis (Song, Hao, Storey, 2015).

We avoided discussion of GANs as we did not use any of their architecture or training insights. However, implicit models are indeed a model class including GANs (e.g., Mohamed and Lakshminarayanan, 2016).

Yes, in principle the neural model used to model y could detect them, but no experiments are shown to really tease this case apart\n\nOne quantitative evidence is that for all setting configurations excluding Spatial, the GCAT baseline captures the latent confounder as well as the implicit causal model (true data is generated from a class that the GCAT subsumes). This means the baseline and implicit causal model only differ by the trait's model, p(y | x, z). The baseline uses a linear model; the implicit causal model uses a neural network. The latter outperforms across all configurations.\n\nWe're open to other suggestions on how to show this quantitatively. In practice, we also see that each trained hidden unit in the first layer has nonzero weights coming from multiple SNPs simultaneously.\n\n> 2) to properly assess the performance of the method on simulated data, it would be good to have evidence that the type 1 error is calibrated [...]\n\nSee discussion in the Comment to all reviewers.\n\n> Clarity: if the target audience of this paper is the probabilistic ML community, it\u2019s very clear.

They all found the paper interesting, well-written, and novel. Quoting R2 for example, \"The main contribution of this paper is to create a bridge between the statistical genetics community and the ML community. The method is technically sound and does indeed generalize techniques currently used in statistical genetics.\"\n\nWe addressed comments in the replies and revision. All reviewers asked questions about the experiments; we provide more detail here.\n\n> R1:  From the description in D.3 the p-value threshold of 0.0025 has been applied. Has this threshold been used for all methods?\n\nThe experiment's procedure strictly follows Song, Hao, Storey (2015). Namely, the p-value threshold is 0.0025 and set across all methods.\n\n> R1:  [...]  the paper should provide additional detail on the results and should contrast the performance of the method without the use of genomic control.\n\nWe used genomic control only to compare to baselines in the literature for the real-world experiment. Unfortunately, we're unable to reproduce these papers' results using the genomic control. This makes it difficult to compare to baselines without genomic control unless we're unfair against them. It's also difficult to necessarily assess which method performs best as there is no ground truth: we can only establish that our work can indeed capture well-recognized causal SNPs as the baselines.\n\n> R1, R2, and R3 ask about recall, false positive rate, and ROC curves.\n\nWe included recall in the revision. All true-positives were found across all methods. Like a real-world experiment, only few (10) SNPs are causal; and in absolute number, the number of false positives typically ranged from 0 to 50 (excluding number of expected false positives); PCA deviated more and had up to 300 for TGP and sparse settings.  Rarely did a method not capture all true positives, and if so, it only missed one.\n\nRegarding false positive rate, it gives a similar signal as the measured precision. This is because as mentioned, the number of true positives was roughly the same across methods. Because precision is the number of detected true positives over the number of detected true positives and false positives, precision simply differed by a method's number of false positives. We also did control for the number of expected false positives; this is clarified in Appendix D's revision.\n\n> R3: * How do the authors call a variant to be associated with the phenotype (y)? More specifically, what is the distribution of the null hypothesis?\n\nWe revised Appendix D. In summary, we followed Song Hao Storey (2015), which calculates a likelihood ratio test statistic for each SNP. It is the difference of the maximum likelihood solution on the trait model to the maximum likelihood solution on the trait model with influence of the SNP fixed to zero. This null has a chi^2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of weights fixed at zero (equal to the number of hidden units in the first layer)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Implicit Causal Models for Genome-wide Association Studies", "abstract": "Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference.
