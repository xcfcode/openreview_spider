We updated the manuscript version with feedback from Reviewer 2 and some of your feedback. We agree that there is a clear consensus of the reviewers in some aspect of our presentation that we will work on clarifying.\n\n* We regret that the assumptions of the theorem were not clear and will make it clearer in the context. While the theorem states that \"SMN and STPR are symbol-shift equivariant.\", where symbol-shift equivariant definition implies that $A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$, it is clear to us now that this should be better highlighted and explained.\n\n> \"There's a claim made in the introduction -- \"we rely solely on differentiation to determine whether a word acts like an entity\". I have not seen any follow up on this claim. \"\n\nThis refers to the parameter $\\alpha_x$ that is learned per word, for instance in Section 4: \"where $\\alpha_x$ is ... a learnable parameter, $0< \\alpha_x<1 $, that indicates how much each word should behave as a symbol\".\n\n> \"$A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$ is a huge assumption. In fact, the model is equivariant without even requiring the symbolic part at all.\".\n\nRegarding the assumption, we believe the problem comes mainly from our presentation and we will make this point clearer. The assumption $A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$ is not needed for our model (as shown in the experiments where this property obviously does not hold), it is needed only in our proof and symbol-shift definition.\n\nThe reason why we use this strong assumption is to be able to restrict the class of possible word permutations without knowing entities groups: clearly, there must be some restriction as we cannot expect the meaning of sentences to be preserved if we allow permuting \"John\" and \"the\" for instance. The classic definition allows permutation only between words of the same group but this imposes knowing the group while our definition of symbol-shift avoids this need.\n\nRegarding the fact that a model with $A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$ with no symbolic will be equivariant: this is true but such a model would not be able to distinguish entities in the same group.\n\nTo summarize, the assumption $A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$ is only required to investigate theoretical properties of the model. We will add experiments with another dataset to show that the approach proposed can also work out of bAbI in real-world settings.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Symbol-Shift Equivariant Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~David_Salinas1", "~Hady_Elsahar2"], "authors": ["David Salinas", "Hady Elsahar"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "Symbolic", "Equivariance", "question answering", "Language Processing"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown to have poor compositionality abilities: while they can produce sophisticated output given sufficient data, they perform patchy generalization and fail to generalize to new symbols (e.g. switching a name in a sentence by a less frequent one or one not seen yet).

When one reads the paper, these are not stated as assumptions but rather part of what's obviously true -- See equation 16 in Appendix A, specifically the assumption that   $A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$. Unless it's obvious from context, theorems clearly state the assumptions they are making, typically in their statement itself, and I ask the reviewers to the same.\n*  $A_{\\tau_{(i)}} = A_i$ is a huge assumption. In fact, the model is equivariant without even requiring the symbolic part at all. This more or less never happens in practice, and that's why I don't believe this model can generalize beyond toy settings, such as bAbI.\n* There's a claim made in the introduction -- \"we rely solely on differentiation to determine whether a word acts like an entity\". I have not seen any follow up on this claim.  \n\nSome suggestions on notations and writing:\n* \"which is a discrete set of n words\" -> Maybe just say \"where |V| = n\"\n* Currently square brackets are used for denoting both a continuos range, and a discrete range. In the \"Hybrid semantic-symbolic embedding\" paragraph, both $\\alpha \\in \\[0, 1\\]^n$ and $x \\in \\[1, n\\]$ are used.

Thank you for the clarification. This should be better mentioned/explained in the paper.\n2. I see that both R1 and R3 had the same confusion. I believe that your explanation is a **crutial** point that the paper should explicitly mention.\n\nI agree with the other reviewers that the paper is hard to parse. I think one suggestion would be to simplify the mathematical notations as I suggested in my original comment.\nfor instance, the one-hot vector of the order of appearance of token $x$ could be defined as $e_x$ rather than $e_\\phi(x)$. What is $\\phi$ anyway? --looking back at the paper-- oh right it is the bijection. yeah so this whole section could be rewritten to avoid confusion. I would suggest to simply talk about matrix $B$ as it is clear with Figure3 that this is just a simple mapping from tokens to 1-hot vector of position. Also, why matrix \"$B$\" and not \"$E$\" since the symbolic representation is noted \"$e_x$\"...?\nNow that I think about it, matrix $B$ (or $E$ to be consistent with vectors $e_x$) is just an $m \\times m$ identity matrix if you organize each row as being the words in order! So yeah really this whole section is very confusing. I think you could just replace it by saying what you said in all your replies to R1, R2, R3, eg:  *the symbolic representation is defined as $\\alpha_x e_x$ with parameter $\\alpha_x \\in [0, 1]$ and $e_x$ being defined as the one-hot vector of the order of appearance of $x$. $\\alpha_x$ is trained alongside the other network parameters with gradient descent, while $e_x$ is kept fixed. Note that if $\\alpha_x = 0 \\forall x$, the model is reduced to a classical \"semantic\"-only model.*\n\nAlso, is $\\alpha_x$ really $ \\in [0, 1]$? I am *guessing* $\\alpha_x$ is the output of a sigmoid unit (if it is, you should definitely say it in the paper), so a continuous variable between 0 and 1, and not a binomial variable that you sample for each word, in which case you should actually denote $0< \\alpha_x  < 1$ explicitly as the $\\in [0,1]$ notation could be confusing and interpreted as being either 0 **or** 1."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Symbol-Shift Equivariant Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~David_Salinas1", "~Hady_Elsahar2"], "authors": ["David Salinas", "Hady Elsahar"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "Symbolic", "Equivariance", "question answering", "Language Processing"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown to have poor compositionality abilities: while they can produce sophisticated output given sufficient data, they perform patchy generalization and fail to generalize to new symbols (e.g. switching a name in a sentence by a less frequent one or one not seen yet).

We would like to point out that the description of the method does not claim that it can restrict possible permutations. The definition of possible permutations (symbol-shift in the paper) is only required to define the class of symbol-shift equivariant models: e.g. the class of model whose outputs is equivariant to possible permutations of symbols. While the definition is restrictive (having semantic vectors equals for different groups of entities is a stringent condition), it is helpful in our view as it allows to restrict to permutations that does not alter syntax (e.g. preventing permuting \"John\" by \"Who\"), it is also helpful as we can prove that some models are indeed equivariant under those conditions.\n\nThe semantic word properties (gender, POS, ...) are learned in a standard way (as noted to R1 if $\\alpha_x = 0$ for all words, the model symbolic component vanishes). For instance, if the model sees \u201cJohn\u201d sufficiently many times, the model learns the word properties with its semantic vector. If the word is never seen during training, our experiments on zero-shot show that the model can still generalize by leveraging the symbolic representation (for words that does not appear in the training, semantic vectors are set to zero).\n\nRegarding the terminology, we agree that using \u201csymbolic\u201d is not standard but given that we are introducing a new type of equivariant representation, it is unclear to us if there would be a standard terminology (we would appreciate any suggestion). We choose to call \"symbolic representation\" parts of the model that are equivariant when permuting symbols (e.g. when applying symbol shift). Note that this does not contain *just* the one-hot of the order of appearance in the context but also how this one-hot representation can be projected back to the vocabulary (again preserving the equivariance property) and how this representation can be transformed.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Symbol-Shift Equivariant Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~David_Salinas1", "~Hady_Elsahar2"], "authors": ["David Salinas", "Hady Elsahar"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "Symbolic", "Equivariance", "question answering", "Language Processing"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown to have poor compositionality abilities: while they can produce sophisticated output given sufficient data, they perform patchy generalization and fail to generalize to new symbols (e.g. switching a name in a sentence by a less frequent one or one not seen yet).

The only free-parameter of the symbolic representation $\\alpha_x e_\\varphi(x)$ is $\\alpha_x \\in [0, 1]$ given that $e_\\varphi(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is set to the one-hot vector of the order of appearance of $x$. With the parameter $\\alpha_x$, the model can learn if a word $x$ should behave as a symbol or not.  \n2. In our definition of symbol-shift, permutation of symbols must happen without changing semantic embeddings so that \u201cbanana\u201d and \u201capple\u201d can be changed only if they share the same semantic word vector. This is a theoretical requirement which allows us to prove formally that the models we introduce are equivariant under symbol shift.\nHowever, in practice as you mention we cannot expect the semantic vector of two entities of the same group to be exactly the same, they would be close but different. Our claim is that the added inductive bias helps in practice, even if the theoretical requirement does not hold, which we aimed to demonstrate in our experiments as the models can generalize to a larger number of entities (for instance in the experiment of Fig 1, the semantic vectors of all entities are close but different), to unseen one and also converges faster than models that do not have the symbolic representation we propose.\n\nAbout your other points on notations, we will do our best to simplify them and we are grateful for your feedback. We agree that the symbolic vector can be described in simple words, however it is a bit more difficult to express the projection of a symbolic vector to the vocabulary in words without equations.\n\nPlease let us know of any other questions you may have.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Symbol-Shift Equivariant Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~David_Salinas1", "~Hady_Elsahar2"], "authors": ["David Salinas", "Hady Elsahar"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "Symbolic", "Equivariance", "question answering", "Language Processing"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown to have poor compositionality abilities: while they can produce sophisticated output given sufficient data, they perform patchy generalization and fail to generalize to new symbols (e.g. switching a name in a sentence by a less frequent one or one not seen yet).

The authors modified a Memory-Network and a Third-order tensor product RNN to make them symbolic-shit invariant. The new models were evaluated and compared on the 20 bAbi tasks. Results show that the symbolic versions of the models yield better performance than the original ones.\n\n**Positives**.\nThe topic is of great interest and it is indeed crutial that neural language models become symbol-shift invariant to allow them to better generalize. This work is clearly motivated.\n\n**Confusions**.\nThe beginning of Section4 mentions that the main idea of this work is to concatenate a regular \"semantic\" word vector with a \"symbolic\" representation essentially corresponding to a one-hot vector of the token order of appearance.\nIn the following paragraphs, the work presented lacks clarity and seems to over-complicate concepts with hard-to-follow math notations. For instance, the \u201c*Mapping words into and from symbolic representations*\u201d paragraph introduces tedious math notations to describes something simple that was clear before, namely, the mapping from tokens to their respective symbolic vector, which is simply defined as the one-hot vector position appearance of this token in the context.\nSimilarly, the \"*Hybrid semantic-symbolic embeddings*\" paragraph uses again tedious math notations to describe how semantic and symbolic embedding are concatenated.\n\nGiven the confusion presented in Section4, it is currently not clear how adding a one-hot vector to the input embedding can make a neural model symbol-shift equivariant.\nIn particular, below are the two things I could not understand:\n1) The paper mentions that \"*all parameters are differentiable*\". It is not clear if that also includes the symbolic representation or not? If so, then the initial one-hot vector may not be a one-hot vector after the gradient updates performed during training, which would result in a non-symbolic representation? if it is kept fix during training, then it is not clear how it is used by the network.\n2) In addition, assuming that the symbolic representation of all tokens stays the same during training, I don't see how \"_permuted symbols share the same latent representations_\" if the latent representations are made of both on-hot vectors **and** regular word vectors. I understand that the symbolic representation does not change for a permuted word since it will appear at the same place as the original word. But the semantic representation will be different. For instance, the semantic word vector of \u201cbanana\u201d is similar but still different than the word vector of \u201capple\u201d.\n\n**Conclusion**.\nI would suggest the authors to simplify their mathematical notation and make their paper easier to read. As of now, I could not fully understand the paper and unfortunately for that reason could only put a score of 4 with a low confidence of 2.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1162/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Symbol-Shift Equivariant Neural Networks", "authorids": ["~David_Salinas1", "~Hady_Elsahar2"], "authors": ["David Salinas", "Hady Elsahar"], "keywords": ["compositionality", "Symbolic", "Equivariance", "question answering", "Language Processing"], "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown to have poor compositionality abilities: while they can produce sophisticated output given sufficient data, they perform patchy generalization and fail to generalize to new symbols (e.g. switching a name in a sentence by a less frequent one or one not seen yet).
