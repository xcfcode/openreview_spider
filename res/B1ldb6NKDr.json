To improve learning in this multi-agent setting, they propose to pre-train a lower-level policy that takes as input foot-step goals and is executed for a fixed number of timestep, thereby simplifying both the learning and exploration. \n\nI'm a bit unsure of how to evaluate this paper. On the one hand, I believe it has several contributions:\n- Proposing a new MARL - continuous control environment\n- Proposing a new lower-level policy for high-demensional continuous control environments, including how to learn it\n- Using it to perform MARL in this environment\n\nOn the other hand, it is hard to say what the _main_ contribution is, which in turn makes it difficult to evaluate whether the experimental evaluation is sufficient:\nClearly, a main part of the paper is the work done to construct the hierarchical setup, including goal space, observation space and reward functions. However, this work, as far as I can tell, is separate from the MARL problem. Furthermore, there are several similar ideas already published, so comparison against those (for example by J. Peng, N. Heess or J. Mere) either as argument or even better as experiment, would be helpful to evaluate the quality of the proposed hierarchy.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the application of the hierarchical setup to the MARL problem. However, as far as I can tell, there is no difference between applying such a hierarchy to the MARL case and to the single agent problem. Especially if the lower-level component of the hierarchy is pre-trained in a non-MARL setup, it can just be seen as part of the environment from the point of view of the MARL training, offerring limited new insight into MARL. \nI believe in the second paragraph of 4.1 the authors provide some insight into this matter, however, I have to admit I do not understand this paragraph: \n- Why does temporal correlation reduce the non-stationarity of the MARL problem?\n- Why does structured exploration reduce the number of network parameters that need to be learned?\n- Why does partial parameter sharing make it easier for each agent to estimate other agents potential changes in behavior?\n\n\nIn summary, I think this is interesting work, but a clearer explanation of the relationship between HRL and MARL, as well as a clearer main argument, supported by experimental evidence, would greatly improve this paper.\n\nEdit:\nThank you for your response.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't feel like it sufficiently addresses my questions and concerns. \nI do apologize if my original comment wasn't clear regarding the contribution part of the paper. What I was trying to say is not that I didn't see the individual contributions of the paper, but instead that the paper does multiple things simultaneously, without comparing against the relevant baselines for any of the individual contributions. \n\nRegarding my questions: I understand where the temporal correlation is coming from in an HRL setting. However, what was not clear to me is how this reduces the non-stationarity of MARL. \nI also understand that HRL can reduce the number of parameters, but I don't see how structured exploration reduces the number of parameters.\nAnd lastly, I also can see how parameter sharing can simplify the learning, but I still don't see how it would allow agents to estimate the behaviour change of other agents easier. \nI feel like in the paragraph in questions, a lot of causes and effects are mixed up and more careful descriptions of the benefits of the algorithm would help. \n\nI want to re-iterate that I think that the submitted work by the authors is impressive and can provide valuable insights, but I believe it requires more work and more relevant baselines.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Navigation", "authors": ["Glen Berseth", "Brandon haworth", "Seonghyeon Moon", "Mubbasir Kapadia", "Petros Faloutsos"], "authorids": ["gberseth@gmail.com", "m.brandon.haworth@gmail.com", "sm2062@cs.rutgers.edu", "mubbasir.kapadia@gmail.com", "pfaloutsos@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Improving MARL by sharing task agnostic sub policies.", "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a particularly challenging problem.

We start by further explaining the contributions in the paper. Our main contribution is the combination of MARL with HRL to enable the decentralized learning of controllers that can navigate and seek goals in a robotic humanoid simulation. The unique combination of methods allows us to learn these sophisticated controllers with far less data than methods without hierarchy (cite openAI Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Interaction). Second, we also consider the environment in the paper another contribution. Few multi-agent environments simulate dynamics, and none have articulated humanoid robots that observer their world using egocentric vision. We plan to release this environment with the work to allow other researchers to pursue and make progress on important complex tasks.\n\nMany multi-agent problems have been studies using simple robot models (point-mass, etc), where more complex and realistic models have used the problem because significantly more challenging. However, often, an assumption can be made that the robots in the environment share similar morphology. We propose a method that uses a form of goal-conditioned RL to learn task agnostic low-level policies that can simplify the share control structure across robots. In most HRL methods, the lower level can be viewed as part of the environment, yet this restructuring of the environment enables faster and more capable learning.\n\n\nHere we clarify some of the proposed advantages of the method. First, the use of HRL enables temporal correlation in action exploration that helps reduce the non-stationarity challenge. The advantage of this temporal correlation is shown empirically in Figures 2 and 3 where the PPO policies do not improve on learning the tasks. This property can be understood to reduce the variance in the policy gradient. Instead of having the policy sample an action every step instead, the low-level policy is triggered for $k$ timesteps with a goal proposal. For these $k$ timesteps, no noise is added to the low-level policy outputs. Similarly, this $k$-step structured exploration enables learning. If we think of the policy as a type of VAE that is learning an encoder (high-level) that is trying to learn a good latent goal (z) that will result in the low-level performing the desired sequence of actions. The HRL structure is reducing the dimensionality of the control problem given a low-level designed to perform diverse behaviour wrt to the goal (cite Heess and DIAYN). Last, the partial parameter sharing appears to make the learning problem easier. We know it is challenging to learn Q functions, which implies that the centralized methods that use Q functions will not scale well. We compare our method to MADDPG, a popular centralized method that works by treating the problem as a single agent problem with complete information. In our case, this method results in a significant increase in network parameters for the Q function, which leads to poor learning performance, as can be seen in Figures 2 and 3. Our particular configuration allows our method to be decentralized, making the individual network for each agent more straightforward. We are also interested in generalization to different numbers of agents after training, which is also problematic for centralized methods. In short, decentralized learning will allow for more general methods, and HRL enables the learning of sophisticated controllers.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Navigation", "authors": ["Glen Berseth", "Brandon haworth", "Seonghyeon Moon", "Mubbasir Kapadia", "Petros Faloutsos"], "authorids": ["gberseth@gmail.com", "m.brandon.haworth@gmail.com", "sm2062@cs.rutgers.edu", "mubbasir.kapadia@gmail.com", "pfaloutsos@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Improving MARL by sharing task agnostic sub policies.", "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a particularly challenging problem.

While the method is the first to be applied to a multi-agent simulation with articulated humanoid character, our main contribution is a method to allow sophisticated controllers to be learned in this case. Our unique combination of structured learning enables the learning of strong polices without incredible amounts of computing time (cite openAI Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Interaction). We also argue that the learning and control problem for the high-level policies is more complicated than a \u201cpoint mass\u201d environment. The high level needs to learn strategies to cope with a dynamic simulation that includes, pushes, slips, balancing, etc, all through the capabilities of a low-level policy while optimizing a goal-seeking objective. This simulation environment it also novel in that no other simulation has put multiple dynamic humanoid agents in a simulation that observe each other using egocentric vision. In other simulation libraries, it is possible to add more agents, but no tasks have been constructed or learned that match the complexity in this work.\n\nWe agree that the paper writing can be improved. Significant edits to the paper have been made to make the method and its contribution more clear. These edits include moving the details for training the goal-conditioned low-level controller to the main paper, including adding a new task for 2-on-2 soccer for which MAHRL has shown significant progress on learning.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Navigation", "authors": ["Glen Berseth", "Brandon haworth", "Seonghyeon Moon", "Mubbasir Kapadia", "Petros Faloutsos"], "authorids": ["gberseth@gmail.com", "m.brandon.haworth@gmail.com", "sm2062@cs.rutgers.edu", "mubbasir.kapadia@gmail.com", "pfaloutsos@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Improving MARL by sharing task agnostic sub policies.", "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a particularly challenging problem.

In particular it proposes to explicitly decouple training of a high-level and low-level controller with grounded the controller interface as goals in the environment to reach for the low-level controller. The model is trained via PPO with GAE and evaluated on a small set of multi agent locomotion tasks.\n\nThe paper is overall well written and intuitive but limited in evaluation and novelty (see e.g. [1,2] ) with only limited modifications (sharing low-level controller) for the multi agent case. Furthermore, the experimental section does not compare to other forms of hierarchical approaches for MARL, and generally only provides a single comparison to PPO & MADDPG. To evaluate the impact of the proposed changes in this paper, one would have to perform extended evaluations and ablations for the submission. \n\nA large part of making the MA system work well is based on reward shaping which nearly fills all of page 5. This is clearly interested in as far as solving this particular task but does not provide any general insights for the design of (MA)RL algorithms. \n\nThe experimental section includes various mistakes (see under minor) and misses to describe figures, leading to the assumption that additional time is required for a more detailed evaluation of the algorithm (including more domains and in particular baselines).\nRegarding the challenges (and focus on learning simple tasks), reference [3] might be of interest to the authors.\n\nMinor\n- Direct duplication of text between parts of section 5.3 and 8.3 leading to the duplication of the error of describing the value function learning rate as 0.000.\n- Self-referential sentences in the supplementary materials (i.e. referral to itself)\n- Missing references on page 3\n- The egocentric velocity field is not described (section 5)\n- Section 3.1: maximize\n- The wording new paradigm in MARL might be unsuited given existing work on complex domains.\n\u2018Our proposed approach represents the first physics-based simulation of its kind that supports MARL.\u2019 This sentence remains unclear as the authors do not propose a simulation engine.\n- Text on experiment figures is much too small.\n\n[1] Andrew Levy, Robert Platt, and Kate Saenko.

The key difference of this paper with the prior work on MARL is that it used an accurate physics simulation of humanoid robots. This is the main reason of using the hierarchical RL. \n\nIn general, I like this paper. It is an important step towards multi-agent learning in complex physical environments. The results look appealing, too. However, I voted for \"Weak Reject\" for two reasons. First, the technical contribution is lean. Neither the multi-agent learning or the hierarchical learning of the algorithm is novel. The combination of these two methods seems straightforward. Once a low-level walking controller is trained, the high-level multi-agent navigation control is not much different from simple environments, e.g. point mass control, used in the previous works. I do not understand the \"deep integration of MARL and HRL\" that is claimed in the Introduction. I also do not agree with another claim that \"We consider the simulation and training environment to be another novel contribution... few simulator support more than one agent, at most 2\". In most of the simulators that I am familiar with, such as Mujoco, Bullet, DART, it is straightforward to add multiple simulated robots.\n\nSecond, the writing can be greatly improved. Almost half of the technical details are buried in \"8. Supplementary material\". Since it is not fair to use \"Supplementary material\" as a way to extend the page limit, I will make my judgement of the paper solely based on the contents up to Section 7. In the main text (up to Section 7), there is no mentioning of how the low-level controllers are learned, and how to combine PPO in a MARL partial parameter sharing setting. I think that these are important details and may also be the contributions of this paper. Most of these should be moved to the main text. \n\nHere are some more suggestions on writing:\n1) Certain paragraphs in the main text can be significantly shortened, such as the reward shaping in Section 5.2. \n2) It would be great if the paper can clearly define the experiments: \"waypoint\", \"oncoming\", \"mall\", and \"bottleneck\".\n3) The paper needs a thorough proof-reading. There are many grammar mistakes, typos, missing citations. For example,\npromiss->promise\nweek signal->weak signal\nmissing citation [?] in page 3\nreuse the same symbol v_{com} for agent's velocity and desired speed in eq(3)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper380/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Navigation", "authors": ["Glen Berseth", "Brandon haworth", "Seonghyeon Moon", "Mubbasir Kapadia", "Petros Faloutsos"], "authorids": ["gberseth@gmail.com", "m.brandon.haworth@gmail.com", "sm2062@cs.rutgers.edu", "mubbasir.kapadia@gmail.com", "pfaloutsos@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"], "TL;DR": "Improving MARL by sharing task agnostic sub policies.", "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a particularly challenging problem.
