We address your comments one by one as following:\n\n[Manipulate sharing/analyze what is shared]\n\nWe agree that controlling and analyzing the amount of sharing is an interesting direction. However, this is a non-trivial task as we explained in our response to reviewer 2. Manipulating the amount of sharing requires using disjoint lookup tables for embeddings, which is perhaps easier to achieve for contextualized representations using deep models than non-contextualized ones using fasttext. Nonetheless, our experiments in the response to reviewer 2 shows that better seed dictionaries for training fasttext are clearly beneficial. In general, what should be shared and how to share them are still open questions that we plan to explore in the future.\n\n[BLI results]\n\nThe two directions of en->others and others->en use different test sets and thus their results are not directly comparable. This is perhaps why their relative performance varies.\n\n[Intuition for (6)]\n\nThe intuition here is to reallocate words that predominantly appear in a single language to that language. Lambda is a threshold such that if the ratio falls outside of the range it means the word appears mostly in one language (depending on which side it falls) only. \n\n[Typo and better presentation]\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out typos and giving kind suggestions.

We address your comments one by one as following:\n\n[Terminology and joint training]\n\nWhile we meant to say this is a method that unifies two previously exclusive approaches by calling it a framework, we agree that it can be stated in a better way. We will rephrase our terminology in an updated version.\n\nThe joint training paradigm attracts the community\u2019s growing attention recently, especially for the contextualized representations such as multilingual BERT. There are still many open questions such as why joint training models work and how to further improve them. In addition to the non-contextualized joint training explored by [1], we also conduct experiments for the contextualized representations and show that alignment can still improve pretrained models. This is consistent with (very) recent results [2], which also suggest combining ideas from alignment as a future research direction. \n\n[BLI evaluation]\n\nYour understanding of the evaluation protocol is correct. We concatenate each language\u2019s own subset with the shared subset and use the two concatenated parts for evaluation. This is equivalent to your description since if the query is in the shared part it will automatically retrieve itself by the nature of CSLS. We will make this clear in an updated version.\n\n[Oversharing]\n\nThe oversharing issue has three undesirable effects: (1) it results in a poor seed dictionary for the joint initialization (2) it prohibits the application of alignment refinement, and because of which, (3) it hinders performance on downstream tasks by making false assumptions on word translations. While we agree that it is most relevant for BLI in our experiments, recent work [3] also shows less sharing (thus a larger vocab size & more parameters) can be beneficial for contextualized representations on harder downstream tasks such as language understanding and question answering, and we hypothesize this is partly due to oversharing of tokens with different meanings in different languages.\n\n[1] Phrase-Based & Neural Unsupervised Machine Translation.

We address your comments one by one as following:\n\n[Improvements of distant language pairs/Reduced isomorphism]\n\nThe source of improvement for jointly training two distant languages is still an open question. As recently shown in [1], joint training is still beneficial even for languages using disjoint vocabulary sets. Although their findings are based on contextualized representations, we observe similar improvements for non-contextualized representations in our experiments and we hypothesize that the improvement is due to the overlap in training corpus resulting in more similar graph structures of embeddings (i.e. suffer less from the reduced isomorphism issue). \n\nTo analyze the effect of reduced isomorphism, we compute the eigenvector similarity proposed in [2]. This metric measures the degree of similarity between two embedding graphs and therefore can be used to estimate the degree of isomorphism. In particular, we compute this metric using four embeddings: monolingual fasttext, fasttext aligned with RCSLS, joint training (unsupervised), and joint_align with RCSLS. The results are shown below (smaller values indicates graphs are more similar). In particular, we observe that jointly trained embeddings share more similar graph structures than independently trained counterparts and thus they suffer less from the reduced isomorphism problem. These results also suggest that the alignment refinement step suffers less from this problem due to a better initialization from joint training.\n\n                                  en-es |en-fr|en-de|en-it|en-ru|en-zh| avg\nfasttext                       3.25 | 3.73 | 4.48 | 4.15 | 4.92 | 5.02 | 4.26\nfasttext_RCSLS          2.56 | 2.59 | 2.02 | 2.72 | 3.60 | 2.82 | 2.72\nUnsupervised Joint   2.59 | 1.98 | 2.38 | 2.59 | 2.94 | 2.79 | 2.55\nJoint_Align                  1.48 | 2.00 | 1.75 | 2.45 | 3.07 | 2.68 | 2.24\n\n[Joint training with seed dictionary]\n\nWe agree that adding a joint training baseline using seed dictionaries is didactic. However, this is a non-trivial task since joint training works best with fasttext in order to utilize subword information, which does not take an explicit form of seed dictionary nor allow tokens with different surface forms to share same embeddings. Therefore, instead of fundamentally modifying fasttext, we use a simple approach: (1) for each word in the dictionary, we randomly replace its occurrences in the concatenated corpus with its translation 50% of the time and keep it unchanged for the rest, (2) we then train the joint training embeddings as in the paper, (3) for words in the seed dictionary, we take the average of their embeddings and treat them as one single word shared between the two languages. We use the same seed dictionary from MUSE as in other experiments. As pointed out by reviewer 3, manipulating the degree of sharing is an ambitious goal that we plan to study in the future and may include in a later version.\n\nAs shown in the table below, we observe that using the seed dictionary as \u201cshared words\u201d improves the performance of unsupervised joint training. However, since this method still treats identically spelled words as shared words (which is implicitly forced by the nature of fasttext), it still suffer from the oversharing problem as we observe further improvements by applying an extra vocabulary reallocation step.\n\nBLI:\n                                 en-es|es-en|en-fr|fr-en |en-de|de-en|en-it|it-en|en-ru|ru-en|en-zh|zh-en|avg\nUnsupervised Joint  33.4| 36.6 | 42.2 | 47.4 | 39.5 | 41.4  | 36.8 | 38.8| 4.00 | 3.50 | 17.9  | 10.2  |29.3 \nReplace                      48.2| 47.7 | 49.4 | 52.1 | 46.5 | 46.9  | 43.8 | 45.8| 20.3 | 36.6 | 32.7  | 34.1  |42.0 \nReplace+VR               67.1| 68.7 | 66.4 | 68.4 | 62.3 | 64.2  | 57.3 | 60.6| 42.6 | 50.1 | 46.5  | 43.6  |58.2 \nJoint_Align                 86.0| 88.5 | 83.9 | 85.8 | 79.3 | 78.7  | 79.9 | 83.1| 60.4 | 69.2 | 57.2  | 50.4  |75.2 \n\nNER:\n                                       es     |      nl     |     de     |    avg\nUnsupervised Joint  50.28   |   42.77  |  21.49  |   38.18\nReplace                      65.28   |   68.44  |  51.59  |   61.77 \nJoint_Align                 70.46   |   72.10  |  56.47  |   66.34 \n\n(The method described above is denoted as \u201cReplace\u201d and we also include baselines from the paper for your convenience. \u201cVR\u201d denotes vocabulary reallocation.)\n\n[Extension to contextualized representations]\n\nWe agree that applying alignment methods to contextualized representations is straightforward.

Put a different way, how much is performance affected if you perform alignment w/variously sized sub-partitions of the seed dictionary? Can you find a core lexicon (perhaps most common words shared cross-lingually) that will provide a good-enough alignment to joint-align with?

The authors argue that each approach has its own advantages, and propose a \"unified framework\" that essentially applies them sequentially (first train jointly, and then further align them after the necessary vocabulary reallocation).\n\nI have generally positive feelings about the paper. To be honest, I do not like the way the authors frame their work (e.g. the way the method is motivated in Section 2.3 or calling it a \"unified framework\"), but the actual method they propose does make sense, the experimental evaluation is solid, and the results are generally convincing.\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n- Good coverage of related work, including recent publications.\n\n- Thorough evaluation in 3 different tasks, much better than what is common in the area (usually limited to BLI).\n\n- The authors experiment with contextual embeddings in addition to conventional word embeddings.\n\n- Generally convincing results with relevant ablations and reasonable baselines.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- I feel that framing this as a \"unified framework\" for cross-lingual alignment and joint training is going a bit too far. The proposed method is as simple as first doing the joint training and then the cross-lingual alignment (with a special treatment for vocabulary reallocation). This is just a sequential application of two class of methods, and not what I would understand as a \"unified framework\" (which suggests some form of generalization or at least a closer interaction to me). At the same time, the only \"joint training\" that the authors explore is training regular embeddings over concatenated monolingual corpora, which as far as I know has only been explored by Lample et al. (2018), and I would not consider as a representative example of this family of methods.\n\n- It is not clear how the different vocabulary spaces are handled in BLI. My understanding is that if the query is in the source vocabulary subset the retrieval is done over the target subset, and if it is in the shared subset it is the same query word that is returned, but this is not clear at all.\n\n- I think that the issue of \"oversharing\" is magnified in the paper. I understand that this is directly connected to the reallocation step in the proposed method, and it of course makes sense to also map words that predominantly appear in a single language. However, in relation to the downstream tasks themselves, oversharing only seems relevant for BLI, where one needs to delimit the retrieval space and avoid returning the query word (which is of course its own nearest neighbor) unless it actually exists in the target language. This is connected to my previous point, and I think should be discussed in isolation.\n\n\nOther minor things to improve:\n\n- Please make Figure 2c an actual table instead of an image."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1420/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1420/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ziruiw@cs.cmu.edu", "jiatengx@cs.cmu.edu", "ruochenx@cs.cmu.edu", "yiming@cs.cmu.edu", "gneubig@cs.cmu.edu", "jgc@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Cross-lingual Alignment vs Joint Training: A Comparative Study and A Simple Unified Framework", "authors": ["Zirui Wang*", "Jiateng Xie*", "Ruochen Xu", "Yiming Yang", "Graham Neubig", "Jaime G.

While I like and acknowledge the fact that the paper examines these frameworks critically and has also some didactic value, I still have some concerns regarding the current experiments, and would like to see some additional analyses in the paper. Honestly, this type of work would work better as a short ACL/EMNLP paper, as the core methodological contribution is a very simple combination of the existing techniques.\n\nWith joint methods, it is true that shared words can be used as implicit bilingual learning signal which gets propagated further in the model. Even in the case of alignment-based methods, it was shown that this signal can assist in learning shared cross-lingual spaces, but: 1) such spaces are of lower-quality than the spaces learned by relying on seed dictionaries (see e.g., the work of Vulic and Korhonen (ACL 2016)), 2) this is useful only for similar language pairs which use the same script. The paper fails to provide an insightful discussion on how the scores differ when we move towards more distant languages. For instance, English-Chinese is included as a more distant language pair, and the combined method seems to work fine, but the reader is left wondering why that happens. The same is true for English-Russian. The paper should definitely provide more information and insights here. \n\nOne experiment that would be quite interesting imho is to take seed dictionaries to initialise the joint training method. It will not be unsupervised any more, but it would be very useful to report the differences in results between fully unsupervised joint initialisation (which, as mentioned should work only with more similar languages) and such weakly supervised init: e.g., the method could take all one-to-one translation pairs from the seed dictionary as 'shared words'. It would also be interesting to combine such 'shared words' and words that are really shared (identically spelled words) as initialisation and measure how it affects the results, also in light of differences in language distance. Adding one such experiment would make the paper more interesting.\n\nSome recent strong baselines are missing: e.g., I wonder how the model that does self-learning on top of seed dictionaries (similar to the work of Vulic et al., EMNLP 2019) compares to the proposed method. Also, can we use the same self-learning technique with the combined method here? Would that lead to improved results? Another work I would like to see comparisons to is the work of Zhang et al. (ACL 2019) and despite the fact that the authors explicitly stated that they decided not to compare to the work of Artetxe et al. (ACL 2019) as they see it as concurrent work, I would still like to see that comparison as the model of Artetxe et al. seems very relevant to the presented work.\n\nI do not see the extension to contextualized representations (described in Section 3.2) as a real contribution: this is a very straightforward method to apply an alignment-based method on multilingual BERT representations, and very similar techniques have been probed in previous work (e.g., by Aldarmaki & Diab), only the bilingual signal/dictionary came from parallel data instead.\n\nFinally, as mentioned before, one of the must-have experiments is including more (distant and diverse) language pairs and analysing the results across such language pairs, with an aim to further understand how the levels of sharing, over-sharing, and non-isomorphism affect performance. Also, while the authors state that reduced isomorphism is the key problem of alignment-based methods, I still fail to see how exactly the alignment refinement step does not suffer from that problem? More discussion is needed here.\n\nOther comments:\n- It would be useful to also point to the survey paper of Ruder et al. (JAIR 2019) where the difference between alignment-based and joint models is described in more detail and could inform an interested reader beyond the confines of the related work section in this paper. Similarly, differences between joint models and alignment-based models have also been analysed by Upadhyay et al. (ACL 2016); Vulic and Korhonen (ACL 2016).\n\n- I like how Figure 1 clearly visualizes the main intuitions behind the proposed framework, and how mitigating the oversharing problem leads to better alignments. This was very nice.\n\n- In light of the problems with silver standard MUSE datasets (see also the recent work of Kementchedjhieva, EMNLP 2019), I would suggest to run BLI experiments on more language pairs: e.g., there are BLI datasets of Glavas et al available for 28 language pairs."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1420/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1420/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["ziruiw@cs.cmu.edu", "jiatengx@cs.cmu.edu", "ruochenx@cs.cmu.edu", "yiming@cs.cmu.edu", "gneubig@cs.cmu.edu", "jgc@cs.cmu.edu"], "title": "Cross-lingual Alignment vs Joint Training: A Comparative Study and A Simple Unified Framework", "authors": ["Zirui Wang*", "Jiateng Xie*", "Ruochen Xu", "Yiming Yang", "Graham Neubig", "Jaime G.

[1] is an interesting work and we will include it in our discussion regarding isomorphism assumption in a later version. \n\nOur framework is highly generic and we also were considering the compatibility of this work with our method. But in doing so we became a bit confused regarding the results reported in [1]. It seems that the reported results for RCSLS in [1], with or without the proposed method applied, are lower than the results in the original RCSLS paper [2]. Do you know why this may be? Note that we have reported the original results from the RCSLS paper, which we were also able to reproduce in our own experiments.\n\nAdditionally, do you know if code from [1] is publicly available?
