The paper implements low-rank bilinear pooling on an existing model (Kim et al., 2016b) and builds a model for Visual Question Answering (VQA) that outperforms the current state-of-art by 0.42%. The paper presents various ablation studies of the new VQA model they built.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The paper presents new insights into element-wise multiplication operation which has been previously used in VQA literature (such as Antol et al., ICCV 2015) without insights on why it should work. \n\n2. The paper presents a new model for the task of VQA that beats the current state-of-art by 0.42%. However, I have concerns about the statistical significance of the performance (see weaknesses below).\n\n3. The various design choices made in model development have been experimentally verified. \n\nWeaknesses/Suggestions:\n\n1. When authors explicitly (keeping rest of the model architecture same) compared low-rank bilinear pooling with compact bilinear pooling, they found that low-rank bilinear pooling performs worse. Hence, it could not be experimentally verified that low-rank bilinear pooling is better in performance than compact bilinear pooling (at least for the task of VQA).\n\n2. The authors argue that low-rank bilinear pooling uses 25% less parameters than compact bilinear pooling. So, could the authors please explain how does the reduction in number of parameters help experimentally? Does the training time of the model reduce significantly? Can we train the model with less data? \n\n3. One of the contributions of the paper is that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-art on VQA by 0.42%. However, I am skeptical that the performance of the proposed model is statistically significantly better than the current state-of-art.\n\n4. I would like the authors to explicitly mention the differences between MRN, MARN and MLB. It is not very clear from reading the paper.\n\n5. In the caption for Table 1, fix the following: \u201chave not\u201d -> \u201chave no\u201d \n\nReview Summary: I like the insights about low-rank bilinear pooling using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication) presented in the paper. However, it could not be justified that low-rank bilinear pooling leads to better performance than compact biliear pooling. It does lead to reduction in number of parameters but it is not clear how much that helps experimentally. So, to be more convinced I would like the authors to provide experimental justification of why low-rank bilinear pooling is better than other forms of pooling.\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hadamard Product for Low-rank Bilinear Pooling", "abstract": "Bilinear models provide rich representations compared with linear models.

Although the evaluated model is similar to Fukui et al. several other changes have been made, including question encoding (GRU vs. LSTM), normalization (tanh vs. L2 vs. none). The small difference in performance (0.44% om Table 1) could easily be attributed to these differences.\n2.2.\tAn experimental comparison to the full outer product (e.g. for a lower dimension) is missing. It remains unclear how good the proposed approximation for the full outer product is. While a comparison to MCB is presented this seems insufficient as MCB is a very different model.\n2.3.\tOne of the most important hyper parameters for the Hadamard Product seems to be the dimension of the lower dimensional embedding d. What effect does changing this have?\n2.4.\tComparison with other pooling strategies, e.g. elementwise sum instead of elementwise product.\n3.\tNo theoretical analysis or properties of the approximation are presented.\n4.\tThe paper seems to be general at the beginning, but the claim of the benefit of the Hadamard product is only shown experimentally on the VQA dataset.\n5.\tRelated work: The comparison to the related works in the appendix should at least be mentioned in the main paper, even if the details are the supplemental.\n\n\nMinor\n-\tIt is not clear why the Lu et al, 2015 is cited rather than the published paper from Antol et al.\n-\tSect 2, first sentence: \u201cevery pairs\u201d -> \u201cevery pair\u201d\n\n\nSummary:\nWhile the paper provides a new best performance and an interesting interpretation of Hadamard product, to be a strong paper, either a more theoretical analysis of the properties of this approximation is required or a corresponding experimental evaluation. It is a bit unfortunate that most of the experimental evaluation is not about the main claim of the paper (the Hadamard product) but of unrelated aspects which are important to achieve high performance in the VQA challenge.\n\nTo be more convincing I would like to see the following experiments \n-\tComparison with Outer product in the identical model\n-\tComparison with MCB in the identical model\n-\tComparison with elementwise sum instead of elementwise product\n-\tOne of the most important hyper parameters for the Hadamard Product seems to be the dimension of the lower dimensional embedding d.

Theoretical analysis on multimodal compact bilinear pooling (MCB) is updated in Section 7.1 and Appendix B. In short, multimodal compact bilinear pooling reduces the number of parameters of two-way interactions in a three-dimensional tensor using a hashing function [1]. Each parameter is shared by NM/d terms in expectation, with the variance of NM(d-1)d^2 (N, M: input sizes, d: pooled representation size). The total number of bilinear terms is NM. Since our method is three-way factorization instead of two-way, the parsimony of our model is better than MCB, and our model can afford to allocate more parameters in the two-way interactions.\n2. In Section 5 Experiments, a description is updated to indicate the details of hyperparameters including preprocessing, question & vision embedding in Appendix A.\n3. The effect of joint embedding size d (800 to 1600) is explored in Table 5 (Appendix A).\n4. We publish our source code in Github repository (https://github.com/jnhwkim/MulLowBiVQA), and mention it in Section 5.\n5.

However, there was conflicted results; Malinowski et al. (2016) show that LSTM is slightly better than GRU, and Noh et al. (2016b) revert their previous choice of GRU (Noh et al., 2016a) into 2-layer LSTMs (via personal communication). The 2-layer LSTMs can be also found in Fukui et al. (2016). We cautiously argue that the choice of RNN for question embedding is up to overall architectural design, which is unlike to solely contribute to the performance gain.\n\nWe did not use the concatenation of GloVe word embeddings (Fukui et al, 2016). We are trying to be as simple as possible for model design. This is another reason that we did not take an advantage of question embedding techniques.\n\nFor an experiment of the explicit comparison with compact bilinear pooling, we explicitly substitute *compact bilinear pooling* for *low-rank bilinear pooling*.

(2016), we use MCB followed by Signed Square Root, L2-Normalization, Dropout(rate=0.1), and Linear projection from 16,000-dimension to the target dimension (one for attention parameters, one for output). Also, Dropout(rate=0.3) for a question embedding vector. Experiment details are from Fukui et al. (2016)\u2019s implementation from Github repository (https://github.com/akirafukui/vqa-mcb). For test-dev split, our version of MCB (Fukui et al., 2016) model get 61.48% for overall accuracy (yes/no : 82.48%, number : 37.06%, other : 49.07%) vs 65.08% (ours, MLB). The accuracy is not competent as Fukui et al. (2016)\u2019s, especially for other-type. We attribute this result to other hyper-parameters, which should be adjusted to accordingly. Note that this is an explicit comparison with compact bilinear pooling using the same architecture to control other factors, though it maybe not satisfactory to justify the claim. Rather, we emphasis on the parsimonious property of MLB, which reduces the total number of parameters around 25%, achieving the new state-of-the-art result with reasonable margin.  (We are doing additional experiments to response to your requests, and to double-check if there is any missing critical hyper-parameter in the explicit comparison experiment.)"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hadamard Product for Low-rank Bilinear Pooling", "abstract": "Bilinear models provide rich representations compared with linear models.

We sincerely appreciate that. \n\n# Contribution 1: \u201cFirst, we propose low-rank bilinear pooling to approximate full bilinear pooling to substitute compact bilinear pooling.\u201d\n\nTo enable bilinear approximation in deep neural networks, we propose low-rank bilinear pooling, which is effectively and efficiently replaceable with compact bilinear pooling (which is used for multimodal learning in Fukui et al., 2016). \n\nThe recent rise of multiplicative methods (Hadamard product) in deep neural networks makes us rethink this computation as an intermediate module of pooling in neural networks. In this paper, we explicitly discuss the role of \u201cHadamard product\u201d in deep neural networks as low-rank bilinear approximation.\n\nWe cited \u201cAntol et al. 2015 for VQA\u201d as Lu et al., 2015 (it\u2019s Github repository) in our paper. Xu et al. (2015) use multilayer perceptron as an attention model, to optimize with variational lower bound on the marginal log-likelihood of word sequence given image features.\n\n# Contribution 2: \u201cSecond, Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear Attention Networks (MLB) having an efficient attention mechanism using low-rank bilinear pooling is proposed for visual question-answering tasks. MLB achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, and has a better parsimonious property.\u201d\n\nYes, there are many attention models for VQA. Though some of them already used Hadamard product for multimodal representation learning, we argue that this advantage is not merely from Hadamard itself, but from the interpretation of low-rank bilinear pooling. This interpretation leads to, technically, appropriate embeddings for each modality and applying nonlinear activation function. With this, we could propose a novel attention model, MLB. We include a detailed comparison with Fukui et al. (2016) about stability of model structure and use of parameters in Section 7.1.\n\nBy the way, Xu et al. (2015) didn\u2019t use Hadamard product in attention model, only in LSTM. If we missed something, please let us know.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMoreover, we include FAQ via personal communications.\n\n# What is different from the element-wise multiplication model of Fukui et al. (2016)?\n\nSince they do not describe the details of the comparative experiment, we don't know why they couldn't get a better result. If they only substitute MCB with element-wise multiplication, appropriate embeddings for both modalities are missed. This condition leads to weak bilinear approximation as our paper noted. Nonlinear activation function for the pooling may get another advantage for the optimization. \n\n# For the nonlinear funtion, why is tanh?\n\nIn the prelimary experiments, tanh was the best. We believe tanh is a robust choice for learning except image classification tasks using CNNs (in that case, ReLU). Also, you can think about activation functions in various RNNs.
