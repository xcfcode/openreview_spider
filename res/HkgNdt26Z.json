For this\npurpose, authors employed a linearly interpolated objectives between user\nspecific text and general English, and investigated which method (learning\nwithout forgetting and random reheasal) and which interepolation works better.\nMoreover, authors also look into privacy analysis to guarantee some level of\ndifferential privacy is preserved.\n\nBasically the motivation and method is good, the drawback of this paper is\nits narrow scope and lack of necessary explanations. Reading the paper,\nmany questions arise in mind:\n\n- The paper implicitly assumes that the statistics from all the users must\n  be collected to improve \"general English\". Why is this necessary? Why not\n  just using better enough basic English and the text of the target user?\n\n- To achieve the goal above, huge data (not the \"portion of the general English\") should be communicated over the network. Is this really worth doing? If only\n  \"the portion of\" general English must be communicated, why is it validated?\n\n- For measuring performance, authors employ keystroke saving rate. For the\n  purpose of mobile input, this is ok: but the use of language models will\n  cover much different situation where keystrokes are not necessarily \n  available, such as speech recognition or machine translation. Since this \n  paper is concerned with a general methodology of language modeling, \n  perplexity improvement (or other criteria generally applicable) is also\n  important.\n\n- There are huge number of previous work on context dependent language models,\n  let alone a mixture of general English and specific models. Are there any\n  comparison with these previous efforts?\n\nFinally, this research only relates to ICLR in that the language model employed\nis LSTM: in other aspects, it easily and better fit to ordinary NLP conferences, such as EMNLP, NAACL or so. I would like to advise the authors to submit\nthis work to such conferences where it will be reviewed by more NLP experts.\n\nMinor:\n- t of $G_t$ in page 2 is not defined so far.\n- What is \"gr\" in Section 2.2?\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Distributed Fine-tuning of Language Models on Private Data", "abstract": "One of the big challenges in machine learning applications is that training data can be different from the real-world data faced by the algorithm.

Why is this necessary? Why not just using better enough basic English and the text of the target user?\"\n\nThere is strong evidence that  the language of SMS and/or private messaging is sufficiently different from what we can collect in publicly available resources. Since language changes constantly we need to update the models and we cannot just make a single fine-tuning of basic LM on device. On the other hand the data from a single user is not sufficient for model update so we need data from many different users. The problem is that we cannot (or at least don't want to) collect user data.  We've proposed a method of continuous update of language models without need to collect private data. \n\n\"- To achieve the goal above, huge data (not the \"portion of the general English\") should be communicated over the network. Is this really worth doing? If only the portion of\" general English must be communicated, why is it validated?\"\n\nAs we mention in the paper the volume of the user generated data is small. Actually users generate approx. 600 bytes/day. In our experiments we proceeded from the assumption that fine-tuning starts as soon as 10 Kb of text data is accumulated on device. Our experiments showed that random rehearsal with volume of the rehearsal data should be to the volume of the fine-tuning data. So it is 10 Kb. This number is very small compared to the volume of model weights which are communicated in Federated Learning algorithms. We also discussed the communication efficiency in the answers to other reviewers (see above).\n\n\"- For measuring performance, authors employ keystroke saving rate. For the purpose of mobile input, this is ok: but the use of language models will cover much different situation where keystrokes are not necessarily available, such as speech recognition or machine translation. Since this paper is concerned with a general methodology of language modeling, perplexity improvement (or other criteria generally applicable) is also important.\" \n\nBasically, we agree. And perplexity is reported in all our experiments. We just wanted to emphasize that target metrics should also be evaluated in language modeling like it is done in speech recognition (ASR) or machine translation (BLEU). Also, in (McMahan et al. 2017, https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1EPYJ-C-) word prediction accuracy is evaluated which is relative to KSS.\n\n\"- There are huge number of previous work on context dependent language models, let alone a mixture of general English and specific models. Are there any comparison with these previous efforts?\"\n\n\nThe term context is a bit vague. E.g. in (Mikolov, Zweig 2014, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.5120&;rep=rep1&type=pdf) term \"context\" refers to the longer left context which is unavailable to standard RNN. Anyway longer left contexts are reasonably well catched by LSTM. If \"context\" refers to the running environment (e.g. application context) it is not the exact scope of our work. The standard approach to model adaptaion for the user is either model fine-tuning or interpolation with simpler language model (e.g. Knesser-Ney smoothed n-gram). We tried approaches similar to the proposed in (Ma et al. 2017, https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ru//pubs/archive/46439.pdf) but they performed significantly worse.\n\nI also would like to draw your attention to the privacy analysys part of the paper which we included in the list of our contributions. We consider our contribution significant at least for the following reason. To our knowledge deep neural networks have never been checked for differential privacy coming from the randomness of the training algorithm (combination of SGD, dropout regularization and model averaging in our case). Existing approaches (e.g. Papernot et al. 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf) suggest adding random noise at different stages of training leading to the tradeoff between accuracy and privacy.

The authors assume that the global model will depict general english. However, it is not necessary that the population of users will adhere to general English and hence the averaged model at the next time step t+1 might be significantly different from general English. It is not clear to me as how this mechanism guarantees that it will not over-fit or that there will be no catastrophic forgetting.\"\n\nIn our problem statement we consider general English to be the common language i.e. the commonly used language with statistically insignificant portion of user-specific expressions. It is NOT necessarily the language induced by our in-house corpus. As far as we have a model averaged on many users on the server we can treat this model as general language model. So at each stage T the server-side model represents general language. When the model is sent to the device it is updated according to the user data so there is a risk of catastrophic forgetting. We prevent it by using (eventually) random rehearsal on device (only!). \n\n2) I also would like to draw your attention to the original and practically relevant problem statement.

Why not just using better enough basic English and the text of the target user?\"\n\nThere is strong evidence that  the language of SMS and/or private messaging is sufficiently different from what we can collect in publicly available resources. Since language changes constantly we need to update the models and we cannot just make a single fine-tuning of basic LM on device. On the other hand the data from a single user is not sufficient for model update so we need data from many different users. The problem is that we cannot (or at least don't want to) collect user data.  We've proposed a method of continuous update of language models without need to collect private data. \n\n\"- To achieve the goal above, huge data (not the \"portion of the general English\") should be communicated over the network. Is this really worth doing? If only the portion of\" general English must be communicated, why is it validated?\"\n\nAs we mention in the paper the volume of the user generated data is small. Actually users generate approx. 600 bytes/day. In our experiments we proceeded from the assumption that fine-tuning starts as soon as 10 Kb of text data is accumulated on device. Our experiments showed that random rehearsal with volume of the rehearsal data should be to the volume of the fine-tuning data. So it is 10 Kb. This number is very small compared to the volume of model weights which are communicated in Federated Learning algorithms. We also discussed the communication efficiency in the answers to other reviewers (see above).\n\n\"- For measuring performance, authors employ keystroke saving rate. For the purpose of mobile input, this is ok: but the use of language models will cover much different situation where keystrokes are not necessarily available, such as speech recognition or machine translation. Since this paper is concerned with a general methodology of language modeling, perplexity improvement (or other criteria generally applicable) is also important.\" \n\nBasically, we agree. And perplexity is reported in all our experiments. We just wanted to emphasize that target metrics should also be evaluated in language modeling like it is done in speech recognition (ASR) or machine translation (BLEU). Also, in (McMahan et al. 2017, https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1EPYJ-C-) word prediction accuracy is evaluated which is relative to KSS.\n\n\"- There are huge number of previous work on context dependent language models, let alone a mixture of general English and specific models. Are there any comparison with these previous efforts?\"\n\n\nThe term context is a bit vague. E.g. in (Mikolov, Zweig 2014, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.5120&rep=rep1&type=pdf) term \"context\" refers to the longer left context which is unavailable to standard RNN. Anyway longer left contexts are reasonably well catched by LSTM. If \"context\" refers to the running environment (e.g. application context) it is not the exact scope of our work. The standard approach to model adaptaion for the user is either model fine-tuning or interpolation with simpler language model (e.g. Knesser-Ney smoothed n-gram). We tried approaches similar to the proposed in (Ma et al. 2017, https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ru//pubs/archive/46439.pdf) but they performed significantly worse.\n\nI also would like to draw your attention to the privacy analysys part of the paper which we included in the list of our contributions. We consider our contribution significant at least for the following reason. To our knowledge deep neural networks have never been checked for differential privacy coming from the randomness of the training algorithm (combination of SGD, dropout regularization and model averaging in our case). Existing approaches (e.g. Papernot et al. 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf) suggest adding random noise at different stages of training leading to the tradeoff between accuracy and privacy.

The authors assume that the global model will depict general english. However, it is not necessary that the population of users will adhere to general English and hence the averaged model at the next time step t+1 might be significantly different from general English. It is not clear to me as how this mechanism guarantees that it will not over-fit or that there will be no catastrophic forgetting.\"\n\nIn our problem statement we consider general English to be the common language i.e. the commonly used language with statistically insignificant portion of user-specific expressions. It is NOT necessarily the language induced by our in-house corpus. As far as we have a model averaged on many users on the server we can treat this model as general language model. So at each stage T the server-side model represents general language. When the model is sent to the device it is updated according to the user data so there is a risk of catastrophic forgetting. We prevent it by using (eventually) random rehearsal on device (only!). \n\n2) I also would like to draw your attention to the original and practically relevant problem statement. In the works on Federated Learning issued so far each node is considered only as a client in distributed learning system for gradient calculation. In our approach we guarantee that the model sent to the aggregation server is at the same time the actual model used for typing and gives the best performance for the end user. It is guaranteed by the forgetting prevention mechanism. It has at least following advantages: 1) No need  for synchronization after every iteration as in standard Federated learning scheme. Standard Federated learning uses no more than 20 iterations on each device for reduction of the communication cost (McMahan et al. 2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629) while we send our models only once in an epoch thus significantly reducing the communication cost. ; 2) Simpler synchronization scheme on the server; 3) Faster convergence; 4) Only 1 model is stored on the disk. We think that these results may be interesting to many ML practitioners. \n\n3) You didn't discuss the privacy analysis part of the paper which we included in the list of our contributions.
