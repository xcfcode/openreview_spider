The authors show that the trade-off between compression and model accuracy can be improved by considering a set of k subspaces rather than just a single subspace. Methods for compressing DNNs is an active area of research and this paper presents a promising approach to do so as well as interesting results. \n\nRating: The paper presents interesting ideas for compressing embedding layers. However, since this is an empirical paper, I would expect a more comprehensive set of empirical results and a better comparison with other related methods. Overall, the paper seems not very mature in its current form, hence my rating is 'Ok but not good enough - rejection'.\n\nPros\n----\n* The proposed method is appealing due to its simplicity and the idea of considering multiple subspaces for embedding is plausible in the context of compressing embedding matrices of NLP models.\n\n* The results show improvements as compared to using just a single subspace. \n\n* The framework provides several ideas for future works. \n\nCons\n-----\n* Typically, the SVD takes the form A = UDV, where U and V are the left and right singular vectors and the diagonal entries of D are the singular values. From the discussion it is not clear whether you factor the singular values into U, or whether you simply ignore the singular values? Also, how do you enforce the orthogonality constraints on U and V during the fine tuning stage? Have you considered a simpler low-rank factorization A = EF in your experiments, where no orthogonality constraints on E and F are imposed?\n\n* It would be good to see the progression for k={2,3,4,5} in Figure 5 and 6. Further, the ensemble approach in Figure 6 hasn't been discussed in detail anywhere in the paper. It is not exactly clear to me how you are computing the ensemble.\n\n* It would be very helpful to see some Tables that shows the total number of weights, accuracy, k, j, etc., in order to better understand the performance.  \n\n* How do you determine k and j in practice? Are you using some heuristic or are you simply doing a grid search?\n\n* I would like to see how your method compares to ALBERT and whether a modified ALBERT (as you suggest in your future work section) is doing better.\n \n* I would be interesting to see if you approach is also useful for compressing a fully connected layer in different settings. This should be easy to test and could be reported in the Appendix. \n\nMinor comments:\n--------------\n* It is nice to see that you have many generalizations an extensions in mind, but this section appears very lengthy to me. \n\n* compression rater -> compression rates", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2517/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2517/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Learning meets Projective Clustering", "authorids": ["~Alaa_Maalouf1", "~Harry_Lang1", "~Daniela_Rus1", "~Dan_Feldman1"], "authors": ["Alaa Maalouf", "Harry Lang", "Daniela Rus", "Dan Feldman"], "keywords": ["Compressing Deep Networks", "NLP", "Matrix Factorization", "SVD"], "abstract": "A common approach for compressing Natural Language Processing (NLP) networks is to encode the embedding layer as a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$, compute its rank-$j$ approximation $A_j$ via SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), and then factor $A_j$ into a pair of matrices that correspond to smaller fully-connected layers to replace the original embedding layer.

The only difference is that the SVD computation of the optimal subspace for a cluster of points ($k=1$) is replaced by an approximation algorithm for computing the subspace that minimizes sum over non-squared distances.\n\nHowever, since the deterministic approximation algorithms for the new problem ($\\ell^1$ error) with $k=1$ take a time of $O(nd^4)$ (at least),  where $d=768$.  This change increased the running time of the algorithm from minutes to days (we need to run this approximation algorithm many times in the EM procedure.)\n\nFor that and due to time constraints, we conducted our experiments only on one network (RoBERTA) on $2$ tasks from the GLUE benchmark (MRPC and RTE).\n\nTable 3 compares the original approach of the paper to the $\\ell^1$ error, and it can be seen that mostly using the $\\ell^1$ error as initialization is better than the $\\ell^2$. However, for some reason (that needs further investigation), after fine-tuning for $2$ epochs both approaches reached almost the same accuracy, even more, the $\\ell^2$ approach achieved a better accuracy sometimes. We leave this for future research. \n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, we would like to thank you again for appreciating our result, and for the very helpful suggestions to improve the paper.\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2517/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2517/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Learning meets Projective Clustering", "authorids": ["~Alaa_Maalouf1", "~Harry_Lang1", "~Daniela_Rus1", "~Dan_Feldman1"], "authors": ["Alaa Maalouf", "Harry Lang", "Daniela Rus", "Dan Feldman"], "keywords": ["Compressing Deep Networks", "NLP", "Matrix Factorization", "SVD"], "abstract": "A common approach for compressing Natural Language Processing (NLP) networks is to encode the embedding layer as a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$, compute its rank-$j$ approximation $A_j$ via SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), and then factor $A_j$ into a pair of matrices that correspond to smaller fully-connected layers to replace the original embedding layer.

We have added the suggested table, you can see it in the new version (Table 1). Please, feel free to ask for any change/improvement.\n\n2. Experiments on Albert:\n\nWe tested if the suggested architecture (MESSI) can improve the accuracy of a pre-trained model while maintaining the same number of parameters.  So we used the model ALBERT and factored its embedding layer to the suggested MESSI architecture using our pipeline.  Here, we choose the values of $k$ and $j$ such that the original embedding layer size is maintained (up to a very small change).  The results are so promising. Table 2 in the paper shows that we improved the accuracy of the original model for most of the tasks.\n\n3.

I would expect a more comprehensive set of empirical results \n \nA: Following this reviewer's request,  many experiments were added. Including \n\n    1. compressing fully connected layers using the suggested approach.\n\n    2. checking how another clustering method can fit in our pipeline. \n\n    3. more results on other $k$-value as requested.\n\nAlso, we are coding and running more experiments now -- hoping to finish before the deadline.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ:  Typically, the SVD takes the form A = UDV...from the discussion, it is not clear whether you factor the singular values into U, or whether you simply ignore the singular values?\n\nA: As in previous papers, we use the more general factorization (as e.g. in NNMF) A=EF which corresponds to a pair of layers. This means that we did not ignore the singular values, and they can be assigned to either the left or right matrix. See next question.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: how do you enforce the orthogonality constraints on U and V during the fine-tuning stage? \n\nA: We did not.  This is a very good point that was added to the text. The orthogonalization is used to obtain a low rank approximation A~EF using SVD. From this point, we did not see an advantage to keep this property in the network.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: Have you considered a simpler low-rank factorization A = EF in your experiments, where no orthogonality constraints on E and F are imposed?\n\nA: This is exactly what we do after computing SVD, as explained in the previous answers. In fact, any non-orthogonal base to the span of the reduced matrix will do.  It is an interesting idea to try other non-orthogonal basis, as done e.g. in Dictionary learning.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ:  It would be good to see the progression for k={2,3,4,5} in Figure 5 and 6.\n\nA: Added. We thank the reviewer for this good suggestion.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ:  The ensemble approach in Figure 6 hasn't been discussed in detail anywhere in the paper. \n\nA:  Added. Due to space constraints, the graphs and explanations can be found in the appendix. \n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nQ:  It would be very helpful to see some Tables that show the total number of weights, accuracy, k, j, etc., in order to better understand the performance.\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, and expect to finish this task before the end of the rebuttal. \n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nQ: How do you determine k and j in practice? Are you using some heuristic or are you simply doing a grid search?\n\nA:  For a given compression rate $x$, we try multiple values of $k$ via binary search on $k$.,For every such $k$ value we compute the implied value  $j = (1-x)dn/(n+kd)$, and then check the compression result on those values.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: Apply your technique on ALBERT.\n\nA: We are implementing and running these experiments and expect to finish before the end of the rebuttal.\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: Compress a fully connected layer in different settings using your approach.\n\nA: Added. See Appendix C for  LENET_300_100 and vgg19 models. The results are strong and better than the competitors as in the other experiments. \n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: It is nice to see that you have many generalizations and extensions in mind, but this section appears very lengthy to me.\n\nA: Fixed.

I would be really interested in seeing the comparison of projective clustering vs simpler clustering methods such as k-means\n\nA: Added. This was a very good idea that we believe that significantly improved the paper. See graphs in section E.\n\n The new graphs show that projective clustering can guarantee a better initialization, i.e., better accuracy before fine-tuning. This implies a fewer number of epochs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ: Is projective clustering the only way to find clusters in multiple subspaces?\n\nA: It is a very good question and the answer depends on the definition of \"clusters in multiple subspaces\", i.e., the generative model. Projective Clustering aims to compute subspaces that maximize the likelihood, assuming that every point was generated by adding some noise to a point on a single subspace. As the reviewer suggests, we may assume soft clustering, e.g., that every point is a linear combination of points on a pair of subspaces. Such versions may be defined e.g. via Dictionary Learning.

The idea of finding more than one subspaces to factorize the embedding weight matrix has nice intuition and insights. I vote for accepting.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper has convincing evidence showing the reduction in percent of accuracy drop when applying projective clustering to the embedding weight vectors.\n2. The paper has illustration figures that clearly show the intuition of the approach as well as how the compression is achieved.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. It would be better if more baselines can be included in the experiment comparisons. In particular, Since Step 2-3 of the proposed MESSI pipeline (page 4) is partitioning of all the input neurons and computing SVD for each partition, I would be really interested in seeing the comparison of projective clustering vs simpler clustering methods such as k-means to partition the input neurons, in the evaluation.\n2. The authors discussed extensions such as using $L_1$ error and $L_1$ distance, but no experiments were performed for the extensions. Some experiment results will be better to establish the flexibility of the framework of projective clustering in model compression tasks.\n\nQuestions during rebuttal period: \n1. Please provide some results regarding the weaknesses above, especially the result of more baseline methods.\n2. Is projective clustering the only way to find clusters in multiple subspaces? What are some alternatives? For example, in subspace clustering, all the data points can be projected to the same subspace and form clusters; we may run subspace clustering for multiple times to get clustering results in different subspaces.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2517/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2517/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Learning meets Projective Clustering", "authorids": ["~Alaa_Maalouf1", "~Harry_Lang1", "~Daniela_Rus1", "~Dan_Feldman1"], "authors": ["Alaa Maalouf", "Harry Lang", "Daniela Rus", "Dan Feldman"], "keywords": ["Compressing Deep Networks", "NLP", "Matrix Factorization", "SVD"], "abstract": "A common approach for compressing Natural Language Processing (NLP) networks is to encode the embedding layer as a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$, compute its rank-$j$ approximation $A_j$ via SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), and then factor $A_j$ into a pair of matrices that correspond to smaller fully-connected layers to replace the original embedding layer.
