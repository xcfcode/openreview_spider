The experimental results are interesting which suggests that the method has value but there is key missing information on how the best response policies are constructed that make it difficult to assess the paper and lead to my not wanting to recommend its acceptance. I would highly recommend being more detailed in Sec. 3 to allow me to reassess the paper. I would certainly be willing to update my score if the paper was clearer to read.\n ##########################################################################Pros: \n \n1. The experimental results on Leduc Poker are very speedy in terms of time-steps. \n\n2. The idea of reusing the prior Q functions and just mixing them together rather than re-learning all of the policies is very good. \n\n \n##########################################################################\nCons: \n\n1. The algorithm boxes are so high level that I am struggling to understand how the algorithms work. I would not be able to implement it from reading the paper. \n\n#########################################################################\nThings that would improve readability:\n\n- It would be nice in the algorithm boxes to connect Q-mixing to how the best policy is explicitly output. I was not able to understand how Q-mixing was connected to either Algorithm 2 or 3 and subsequently had difficulty following the paper.\n- \\lambda does not appear to be defined anywhere but appears in the Mixed Oracles algorithm box\n- What is the OpponentOracle and the TransferOracle? They are defined in the algorithm boxes but are not clearly defined elsewhere.\n- The specific example of RPS in section 3.2 does not provide useful intuition by going through the numerics, it may be more helpful to walk through a more high level description. \n- It would probably be useful to move more of the experimental results to an appendix to leave room for the exposition of the algorithms.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response", "authorids": ["~Max_Smith1", "~Thomas_Anthony1", "~Michael_Wellman1"], "authors": ["Max Smith", "Thomas Anthony", "Michael Wellman"], "keywords": ["Empirical Game Theory", "Reinforcement Learning", "Multiagent Learning"], "abstract": "Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is a general algorithmic framework for learning policies in multiagent systems by interleaving empirical game analysis with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).\nAt each iteration, DRL is invoked to train a best response to a mixture of opponent policies.\nThe repeated application of DRL poses an expensive computational burden as we look to apply this algorithm to more complex domains.\nWe introduce two variations of PSRO designed to reduce the amount of simulation required during DRL training.\nBoth algorithms modify how PSRO adds new policies to the empirical game, based on learned responses to a single opponent policy.\nThe first, Mixed-Oracles, transfers knowledge from previous iterations of DRL, requiring training only against the opponent's newest policy.\nThe second, Mixed-Opponents, constructs a pure-strategy opponent by mixing existing strategy's action-value estimates, instead of their policies.\nLearning against a single policy mitigates conflicting experiences on behalf of a learner facing an unobserved distribution of opponents.\nWe empirically demonstrate that these algorithms substantially reduce the amount of simulation during training required by PSRO, while producing equivalent or better solutions to the game.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "smith|iterative_empirical_game_solving_via_single_policy_best_response", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75a3f6e06a8bfbaddae1098cef55e57139dca562.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/fb60abf7fdce06cdc3bb6ee76b85965240d6427d.pdf", "one-sentence_summary": "On each epoch, train against a single opponent policy rather than a distribution; reducing variance and focusing training on salient strategic knowledge.", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nsmith2021iterative,\ntitle={Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response},\nauthor={Max Smith and Thomas Anthony and Michael Wellman},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=R4aWTjmrEKM}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).

These approaches permit to reuse past knowledge in order to reduce the amount of data required for the RL training. The first algorithm Mixed-Oracles transfers the previous iteration of Deep RL, instead of the second one, Mixed-Opponents, transfers existing strategy action-value estimates.\n\nStrengths\nThe paper proposes two convincing alternatives to reuse previous knowledge in the PSRO framework. The two ideas are based on Q-mixing approach: the first one uses this method to transfer Q-values across epochs, the second one to design a new training objective. \nThe experiments show that the proposed methods find a good solution using less simulation than the original PSRO framework. \n\nWeakness\nThe paper is not very novel, since it uses previous approaches (PSRO and Q-mixing) to transfer knowledge for the PSRO framework. \nI am not aware of recent works in this framework but could be useful to compare the proposed approaches with P2RO [1].\nThe Mixed-Opponent section needs a better explanation of the use of Q-mixing as a training objective.\n\n[1]  McAleer, S., Lanier, J., Fox, R., & Baldi, P.

We are happy to hear you found the work very clear, even for a general audience. \n\nYou say that advances that shorten convergence time for PSRO are not significant advances. We disagree: (i) the computational cost of reinforcement learning algorithms is problematic in general. (ii) The PSRO framework uses an independent application of reinforcement learning in its inner loop, each iteration. This multiplies problem (1) by the iteration count. \n\nThe result of these problems is that PSRO can be prohibitively expensive to use. An excellent example of both the value of the PSRO framework, but also the particularly high cost of using it, is recent work on StarCraft 2. *Far from being insignificant, addressing the cost of using PSRO is a crucial challenge in imperfect information games research.*\n\nThe motivations of our work (identified by reviewer 1: \u201c1. starting anew everytime, 2. slower exploration of strategy space, 3. stochastic dynamics making learning difficult.\u201d) address these issues. By transferring knowledge between iterations of PSRO (motivation 1), we have reduced the multiplicative factor caused by multiple applications of reinforcement learning (problem ii). By exploring the strategy space more efficiently (motivation 2) we reduced the number of applications of reinforcement learning required (alleviating problem ii), and by reducing the stochasticity of learning dynamics (motivation 3) we reduced the cost of applying reinforcement learning (problem i).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response", "authorids": ["~Max_Smith1", "~Thomas_Anthony1", "~Michael_Wellman1"], "authors": ["Max Smith", "Thomas Anthony", "Michael Wellman"], "keywords": ["Empirical Game Theory", "Reinforcement Learning", "Multiagent Learning"], "abstract": "Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is a general algorithmic framework for learning policies in multiagent systems by interleaving empirical game analysis with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).\nAt each iteration, DRL is invoked to train a best response to a mixture of opponent policies.\nThe repeated application of DRL poses an expensive computational burden as we look to apply this algorithm to more complex domains.\nWe introduce two variations of PSRO designed to reduce the amount of simulation required during DRL training.\nBoth algorithms modify how PSRO adds new policies to the empirical game, based on learned responses to a single opponent policy.\nThe first, Mixed-Oracles, transfers knowledge from previous iterations of DRL, requiring training only against the opponent's newest policy.\nThe second, Mixed-Opponents, constructs a pure-strategy opponent by mixing existing strategy's action-value estimates, instead of their policies.\nLearning against a single policy mitigates conflicting experiences on behalf of a learner facing an unobserved distribution of opponents.\nWe empirically demonstrate that these algorithms substantially reduce the amount of simulation during training required by PSRO, while producing equivalent or better solutions to the game.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "smith|iterative_empirical_game_solving_via_single_policy_best_response", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75a3f6e06a8bfbaddae1098cef55e57139dca562.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/fb60abf7fdce06cdc3bb6ee76b85965240d6427d.pdf", "one-sentence_summary": "On each epoch, train against a single opponent policy rather than a distribution; reducing variance and focusing training on salient strategic knowledge.", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nsmith2021iterative,\ntitle={Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response},\nauthor={Max Smith and Thomas Anthony and Michael Wellman},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=R4aWTjmrEKM}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

We have gone through all of the relevant minor comments and corrected these issues. Moreover, we have since performed additional copy-edit passes of the entire draft cleaning up more minor grammatical errors. We appreciate the explicit list of issues that were provided.\n\nNext, we would like to address the proposed methods\u2019 dependency on Q-Mixing. This is a major limitation of our study, due to the lack of methods functionality similar to Q-Mixing, and as a result, has led to our focus on discrete action games. This leads to two limitations you\u2019ve mentioned: (1) Q-Mixing potentially confounding the benefit gained from Mixed-Oracles or Mixed-Opponents and (2) lack of evaluation on continuous-action games. We believe both of these points are important directions for future work on sample efficient PSRO. This study is meant to serve as a first-step towards addressing all of these diverse problems. We hypothesize that the naive version of Q-Mixing that we employed in this study serves only as an empirical lower-bound on performance gains afforded by Mixed-Oracles and Mixed-Opponents.\n\nFinally, we will soften the claims about the importance of the hyperparameter selection method. We selected 300 hyperparameter configurations from the options listed in the supplemental material. Each configuration was evaluated for both pure-hparam and mix-hparam. We have added the number of configurations to the paper, thank you for pointing this missing detail.\n\nMinor comments:\n - Fixed the environment dynamics definition.\n - Fixed to correctly refer to the algorithm instead of a section.\n - Figure 1 is an artifact of MSS producing a distribution of deterministic policies (rationally taking the best action) and therefore is independent of the solution concept of the MSS.\n - Fixed to instead directly refer to Markov-Conley Chains. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response", "authorids": ["~Max_Smith1", "~Thomas_Anthony1", "~Michael_Wellman1"], "authors": ["Max Smith", "Thomas Anthony", "Michael Wellman"], "keywords": ["Empirical Game Theory", "Reinforcement Learning", "Multiagent Learning"], "abstract": "Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is a general algorithmic framework for learning policies in multiagent systems by interleaving empirical game analysis with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).\nAt each iteration, DRL is invoked to train a best response to a mixture of opponent policies.\nThe repeated application of DRL poses an expensive computational burden as we look to apply this algorithm to more complex domains.\nWe introduce two variations of PSRO designed to reduce the amount of simulation required during DRL training.\nBoth algorithms modify how PSRO adds new policies to the empirical game, based on learned responses to a single opponent policy.\nThe first, Mixed-Oracles, transfers knowledge from previous iterations of DRL, requiring training only against the opponent's newest policy.\nThe second, Mixed-Opponents, constructs a pure-strategy opponent by mixing existing strategy's action-value estimates, instead of their policies.\nLearning against a single policy mitigates conflicting experiences on behalf of a learner facing an unobserved distribution of opponents.\nWe empirically demonstrate that these algorithms substantially reduce the amount of simulation during training required by PSRO, while producing equivalent or better solutions to the game.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "smith|iterative_empirical_game_solving_via_single_policy_best_response", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75a3f6e06a8bfbaddae1098cef55e57139dca562.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/fb60abf7fdce06cdc3bb6ee76b85965240d6427d.pdf", "one-sentence_summary": "On each epoch, train against a single opponent policy rather than a distribution; reducing variance and focusing training on salient strategic knowledge.", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nsmith2021iterative,\ntitle={Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response},\nauthor={Max Smith and Thomas Anthony and Michael Wellman},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=R4aWTjmrEKM}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

This criticism is based on the fact that we are proposing two algorithms that combine PSRO and Q-Mixing, and do not introduce either of these technologies within this paper. We can see how the experimental focus on using Q-mixing can give this impression. However (1) our approach does not require the use of Q-mixing, alternative methods for mixing pre-trained strategies could be used as the TransferOracle or OpponentOracle; (2) Our work is the first to use such a technology for combining pre-trained policies in PSRO, connecting two previously separate research directions; (3) we proposed two different methods, mixed oracles and mixed opponents. The question of how best to use Q-mixing or a similar technology for PSRO is important, and we make novel contributions to answering this question; (4) we empirically validate that these approaches achieve efficiency improvements in PSRO.\n\nWe will call out these important contributions more clearly in the camera-ready version of our work.\n\nThank you for bringing up a related work P2RO. Pipeline-PSRO (P2RO) is a variation of PSRO that has every epoch of PSRO train simultaneously against a moving target mixture of opponents. The focus of P2RO is not directly on reducing the simulation requirements, but instead the amount of elapsed time for the algorithm to complete by improving scalability. Therefore, P2RO will generally have a lower wall-clock time, but require the same or larger simulation budget then PSRO, and a substantially larger simulation budget than our proposed algorithms. Moreover, P2RO is altering PSRO at the \u201couter loop\u201d (by attempting to run each epoch simultaneously), and as a result, the speed-up can also be applied to both Mixed-Opponents and Mixed-Oracles. Due to the focus of P2RO being on a different problem we do not think it makes sense as a baseline, but we will include this discussion in the related work. \n\nThank you for the concrete feedback on the methodology section.

We are glad that you found the underlying idea behind Mixed-Oracles to be good, and that you thought our experimental results were promising. \n\nYour feedback on our methods section is particularly helpful, we have edited Section 3 for clarity based on the suggestions you\u2019ve offered in this review. In particular, we have a provided more detailed discussion of the algorithmic details in including the notation and functions called. To directly address your concern, the best-response for each method are computed as follows:\n- Mixed-Oracles: Recall in this algorithm we are interested in transferring best-response information across epochs of EGTA (limited to 2-player games). To accomplish this we exploit that PSRO only adds a single new policy to each player\u2019s strategy-set during each epoch. As a result, during each epoch, we can utilize Deep RL to construct a best-response to the new pure-strategy generated from the previous epoch (we denote this with lambda). Now each player will have a set of best-responses to the other player\u2019s individual policies (we denote the set with Lambda). However, the algorithm still must add a best-response to the current empirical game\u2019s solution. This is where we introduce a general function \u201cTransferOracle\u201d which takes in the current solution and set of best-responses and produces a best-response to the provided opponent\u2019s solution (the best-response to sigma_{-i}). In this study, we investigate Q-Mixing as our TransferOracle method. The Q-Mixing policy practically looks like a mixture-of-experts over several value-based policies. \n - Mixed-Opponents: Recall in this algorithm we are modifying the best-response objective. In this case, we are attempting to aggregate a mixed-strategy into a single new policy. This will enable us to obtain two benefits (1) reduce the state-outcome variance induced by the mixed-strategy, and (2) leverage additional information about each opponent policy in the mixed strategy. To do this we introduce a general function \u201cOpponentOracle\u201d which has the same form as the \u201cTransferOracle\u201d. Similar to Mixed-Oracles, we utilize Q-Mixing to aggregate all of the opponent policies into a new opponent policy. This new policy serves as the best-response objective for each player when they are expanding their strategy-set. \n\nAddressing your readability concerns:\n - Q-Mixing was used as both the TransferOracle and OpponentOracle. It took the respective set of policies and some distribution over the policies, and aggregated the information into a single policy (following the Q-Mixing algorithm). \n - Thank you for pointing out this error. We have added this to the discussion in section 3. Lower-case lambda is a single best-response to the one of the policies in the opponent\u2019s strategy-set, and upper-case lambda is the set of lambdas. \n - Apologies again for the definition of OpponentOracle and TransferOracle being implicit. They are functions from strategy-sets and distributions onto single policies. Q-Mixing is an example of one such function, and is the method used in this work. This will be made explicit in section 3.\n - We have edited section 3.2 to remove potentially distracting precision (we\u2019ve kept the precise numerics as an appendix: we think that the example really arises in RPS is also important). The key idea here that \u201cThe problem is that there are already strategies in the empirical game that can defeat player 2's strategies, so the new strategy is not useful. This can be detected by inspecting player 2's Q-functions...\u201d. Please let us know if the new phrasing is an improvement\n - Thank you for the suggestion, we will shift things to the appendix if the space is necessary to correct the methodology. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1701/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response", "authorids": ["~Max_Smith1", "~Thomas_Anthony1", "~Michael_Wellman1"], "authors": ["Max Smith", "Thomas Anthony", "Michael Wellman"], "keywords": ["Empirical Game Theory", "Reinforcement Learning", "Multiagent Learning"], "abstract": "Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is a general algorithmic framework for learning policies in multiagent systems by interleaving empirical game analysis with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).\nAt each iteration, DRL is invoked to train a best response to a mixture of opponent policies.\nThe repeated application of DRL poses an expensive computational burden as we look to apply this algorithm to more complex domains.\nWe introduce two variations of PSRO designed to reduce the amount of simulation required during DRL training.\nBoth algorithms modify how PSRO adds new policies to the empirical game, based on learned responses to a single opponent policy.\nThe first, Mixed-Oracles, transfers knowledge from previous iterations of DRL, requiring training only against the opponent's newest policy.\nThe second, Mixed-Opponents, constructs a pure-strategy opponent by mixing existing strategy's action-value estimates, instead of their policies.\nLearning against a single policy mitigates conflicting experiences on behalf of a learner facing an unobserved distribution of opponents.\nWe empirically demonstrate that these algorithms substantially reduce the amount of simulation during training required by PSRO, while producing equivalent or better solutions to the game.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "smith|iterative_empirical_game_solving_via_single_policy_best_response", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75a3f6e06a8bfbaddae1098cef55e57139dca562.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/fb60abf7fdce06cdc3bb6ee76b85965240d6427d.pdf", "one-sentence_summary": "On each epoch, train against a single opponent policy rather than a distribution; reducing variance and focusing training on salient strategic knowledge.", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nsmith2021iterative,\ntitle={Iterative Empirical Game Solving via Single Policy Best Response},\nauthor={Max Smith and Thomas Anthony and Michael Wellman},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=R4aWTjmrEKM}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

To this end it proposes two different modifications to the standard PSRO setup: 1) Mixed Oracles, and 2) Mixed Opponents. These approaches allow avoiding resetting learning after each outer loop epoch and reduce the stochasticity of dynamics during training. Thee efficacy is demonstrated on relatively simple games but using Deep RL policies where the proposed approaches are at least on par with standard PSRO approach in terms of final performance while drastically improving the sample efficiency.\n\n\nAlthough the paper has quite a few typos and unclear writing in places, it has a fantastic setup with clear description of the problems with standard PSRO it's trying to resolve. The paper points out the clear computational deficiencies with current PSRO style approaches: 1) starting anew everytime, 2) slower exploration of strategy space, 3) stochastic dynamics making learning difficult.\n\n\nThe paper is mostly focused on two-player zero sum games.\nApproach heavily dependent on efficacy of Q-mixing approach (although the idea is more general), so currently limited to discrete action problems.\nMoreover, since there are no alternatives to Q-mixing, we don't actually get any understanding/intuition for why this works and how important is the performance of \"TransferOracle\" or \"OpponentOracle\".\n\nAlthough section 4.4 suggests that the two stage hyperparameter selection wasn't as important, results in Fig 6b are too noisy to fully accept. It's unclear how much compute/samples were required for the hyper parameter selection. In general the results are a lot more noisier for the proposed approaches vs standard PSRO.\n\n**Minor** \n- Environment dynamics should be SxA rather than OxA\n- Algorithm 4.1 does not exist?\n- Fig 1.
