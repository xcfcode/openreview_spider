We provide our feedbacks and modify our paper as follows:\n\n------\n\n**Q1: The idea is similar to ShuffleNet.**\n\n**A1:** We would like to clarify the main difference.\n\n(1) **Problem.** Our CT-Net is to address video classification. In this task, we have to consider decomposition and interactions, not only along channel dimension but also spatial-temporal dimension. For this reason, we propose two principles to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 3D CNNs, in terms of spatial, temporal and channel dimensions. This is the main contribution in this work. On the contrary, ShuffleNet works on the general image classification without insights of video modeling. Hence, it only focuses on channel shuffle and interactions in 2D CNNs.\n\n(2) **Design.** From the channel view, our CT-Net tensorizes the channel dimension as $K\u200b$ sub-dimensions, $C=C_1\\times C_2, \\cdots ,\\times C_K\u200b$. This allows us to achieve sufficient channel interactions progressively, by performing convolution on each of $K\u200b$ sub-dimensions in sequence. On the contrary, ShuffleNet only performs channel shuffle for one-time interaction.  In this case, ShuffleNet can be considered as a special case of our CT-Net with $K=2\u200b$. From the spatial-temporal view, our CT-Net applies spatial ($1\\times 3 \\times3\u200b$) and temporal ($3\\times1\\times1\u200b$) convolution on each sub-dimension, which can progressively enlarge spatial-temporal receptive filed in a CT-Block for video classification. On the contrary, ShuffleNet only consists of group convolution ($1\\times1\u200b$) and depth-wise convolution ($3\\times3\u200b$), which is motivated by lightweight design in image classification.\n\n(3) **Experiment.** If we have to interpret ShuffleNet in the way of our CT operation, we perform ShuffleNet in the same backbone on Something-Something V1. The top-1 accuracy of ShuffleNet vs. CT-Net (without attention design) is **45.9%** vs. **47.3%**. It shows the superior of our CT-Net.\n\n------\n\n**Q2: The contribution of TE is not separated in Table 3 and 4, so it remains unclear whether the performance improvement is due to the enhanced channel interactions or channel attention.**\n\n**A2:** We have made this separation in Table 2(g). Our CT-module can significantly boost its baseline, with **47.3%-16.9%=30.4%** improvement on top-1 accuracy of Something-Something V1. Our TE module can further enhance such improvement by **50.1%-48.0%=2.1%**.  It is clearly shown that our CT module makes the most important contribution to our design. Furthermore, Table 3 and Table 4 are used to show the SOTA comparison. Hence, we show our best result with the integration of CT-Module and TE.\n\n| Model                | GFLOPs |    Top-1 |    Top-5 |\n| -------------------- | :-----: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| Baseline (TSN)       |   43.0 |     16.9 |     42.0 |\n| +CT-Module           |   36.3 |     47.3 |     76.2 |\n| +CT-Module+PWConv    |   37.2 |     48.0 |     76.7 |\n| +CT-Module+PWConv+SE |   37.2 |     48.8 |     77.4 |\n| +CT-Module+PWConv+TE |   37.3 | **50.1** | **78.8** |\n\n------\n\n**Q3:  The approach seems to be only effective when the number of dimensions is low.**\n\n**A3:** Besides accuracy, GFLOPs is also an important factor for our CT module, according to our two design principles. As shown in Table 2(b), when the number of sub-dimensions is higher, GFLOPs is smaller. It shows the effectiveness of high-dimension design in our CT-module. For example, under the comparable accuracy, the setting of $K = 4$ achieves much smaller GFLOPs than the setting of $K = 1$ (GFLOPs: **35.6** vs. **45.8**).\n\n| Number | GFLOPs | Top-1 | Top-5 |\n| ------ | :------: | :-----: | :-----: |\n| 1D     | 45.8   | 46.5  | 75.6  |\n| 2D     | 36.3   | 47.3| 76.2 |\n| 3D     | 35.7   | 47.1  | 75.8  |\n| 4D     |35.6   | 46.5  | 75.3  |\n\n------\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1771/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1771/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CT-Net: Channel Tensorization Network for Video Classification", "authorids": ["~Kunchang_Li1", "~Xianhang_Li1", "~Yali_Wang1", "~Jun_Wang7", "~Yu_Qiao1"], "authors": ["Kunchang Li", "Xianhang Li", "Yali Wang", "Jun Wang", "Yu Qiao"], "keywords": ["Video Classification", "3D Convolution", "Channel Tensorization"], "abstract": "3D convolution is powerful for video classification but often computationally expensive, recent studies mainly focus on decomposing it on spatial-temporal and/or channel dimensions.

(2) Would it be possible or sensible to apply tensorization on the time dimension?**\n\n**A1:** (1) Actually, we decompose channel dimensions of the CNN feature, instead of the input image. Taking ResNet as an example, channel dimensions in stage 2/3/4/5 are 64/128/256/512 respectively, which are large enough to apply our tensorization. \n\n(2) We agree that it is possible to apply tensorization on the time dimension. However, it is more sensible to perform tensorization on the channel dimension, since the time dimension is much smaller than the channel dimension, e.g., the popular choice of time dimension is from 8 to 32 sampled frames. Following your suggestion, we did tensorization on time dimension (8 sampled frames). The top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V1 is 44.0%, which is worse than our CT-Net (47.3%) as expected.\n\n------\n\n**Q2: The ablation study could have included the comparison between only channel tensorization and channel tensorization and self attention, which would highlight the new contribution of the paper.**\n\n**A2:** We have actually done this comparison in Table 2(g). Adding channel tensorization can achieve 30.4% accuracy improvement (baseline vs. baseline+CT: 16.9% vs 47.3% on Something-Something V1). Adding attention would further achieve 2.1% accuracy improvement (48.0% vs. 50.1%). Clearly, the CT module makes the most important contribution to our design.\n\n| Model                | GFLOPs |    Top-1 |    Top-5 |\n| -------------------- | :-----: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| Baseline (TSN)       |   43.0 |     16.9 |     42.0 |\n| +CT-Module           |   36.3 |     47.3 |     76.2 |\n| +CT-Module+PWConv    |   37.2 |     48.0 |     76.7 |\n| +CT-Module+PWConv+SE |   37.2 |     48.8 |     77.4 |\n| +CT-Module+PWConv+TE |   37.3 | **50.1** | **78.8** |"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1771/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1771/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CT-Net: Channel Tensorization Network for Video Classification", "authorids": ["~Kunchang_Li1", "~Xianhang_Li1", "~Yali_Wang1", "~Jun_Wang7", "~Yu_Qiao1"], "authors": ["Kunchang Li", "Xianhang Li", "Yali Wang", "Jun Wang", "Yu Qiao"], "keywords": ["Video Classification", "3D Convolution", "Channel Tensorization"], "abstract": "3D convolution is powerful for video classification but often computationally expensive, recent studies mainly focus on decomposing it on spatial-temporal and/or channel dimensions.

We provide our feedbacks and modify our paper as follows:\n\n------\n\n**Q1:  The abstract is too long /Table 2 looks clumsy/Need careful proof-reading.**\n\n**A1:** Thanks for this comment. We have simplified them (abstract on page 1 and Table 2 on page 6) and corrected the typos in the updated paper.\n\n------\n\n**Q2:  Results of the Sport1M dataset are missing.**\n\n**A2:** There are two main reasons.\n\nFirst, in the last two years of the action recognition community, most approaches (such as Non-local [1], SlowFast [2], X3D [3] and TSM [4]) are evaluated on Kinetics400 and/or Something-Something. Hence, we follow them to make a fair and rigorous comparison. \n\nSecond, Sports1M has been collected before 2014, from public videos on Youtube. The links of many videos are actually no longer valid, which makes experimental comparison infeasible. Thanks for this suggestion, and we will take it as our future work.\n\n------\n\n**Q3: What are the reasons for choosing something-something V1 dataset for ablation studies? How about the ablation experiments on Kinetic and something-something V2 dataset?**\n\n**A3:** There are two main reasons.\n\nFirst, Something-Something V1 is a challenging benchmark that exhibits complex spatial-temporal action evolutions in videos. Hence, it is a suitable dataset to evaluate video feature interactions of our CT-Net.\n\nSecond, Something-Something V1 is relatively smaller than Kinetics and Something-Something V2. Using this dataset for ablation studies allows us to investigate all the detailed designs of CT-Net, with feasible computation cost. \n\nDue to the time limitation of rebuttal, we further conduct some ablation studies on Mini-Kinetics (a subset of Kinetics400) and Something-Something V2, and report the results in Table 7 (on page 12) of our updated appendix. As expected, the performance trend is similar to that on Something-Something V1 (i.e., Table 2 (a)).\n\n| Model          | Backbone | GFLOPs | Mini-Kinetics Top-1&Top5 | Something-Something V2 Top-1&Top5 |\n| :------------- | :-------: | :----: | :-----------------------: | :--------------------------------: |\n| C3D-Module     |   2D R50 |  59.9  |        77.5 & 93.0        |            59.1 & 85.5             |\n| R(2+1)D-Module |   2D R50 |  45.8  |        77.8 & 93.2        |            60.0 & 86.0             |\n| CSN-Module     |   2D R50 |  35.6  |        77.6 & 93.2        |            59.5 & 86.0             |\n| Our CT-Module  |   2D R50 |  36.3  |    **78.0** & **93.6**    |        **60.3** & **86.4**         |\n\n------\n\n**Q4: Why to choose ResNet-50 and ResNet-101? How about ResNet-152\uff1f**\n\n**A4:** There are three main reasons.\n\nFirst, for efficient video classification, most existing approaches (such as TSM [4], STM [5], TEA [6] and GST [7]) adopt ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 as the backbone. We follow them for a fair comparison.\n\nSecond, as shown in Table 3, our CT-Net-50 achieves even better accuracy than ir-CSN-152 on Something- Something V1, showing the power of our method. \n\nThird, although deeper network would perform better, this brings expensive computation cost which is infeasible for our current computation resource. We will take it as our future work.\n\n------\n\n**Q5: (1) Why do authors adapt ResNet as proposed CT-Net? (2) Can we adapt other pre-trained Imagenet architectures as CT-Net?**\n\n**A5:** (1) ResNet is a widely-used architecture with standard and effective residual blocks. Most recent works on video classification (e.g. Non-local [1], SlowFast [2], TSM [4] and TEA [6]) choose it as the backbone to show effectiveness. Hence, we choose it for a fair comparison with other methods. \n\n(2) It is possible to adapt other networks as CT-Net. We adapt InceptionV3 as our CT-Net. As shown in Table 8 (on page 13) of our updated appendix, CT-Net with InceptionV3 as backbone also works well. \n\n| Method         |   Backbone   | GFLOPs | **\\#Param.(M)** |  Top-1   |  Top-1   |\n| :------------- | :----------: | :----: | :-------------: | :------: | :------: |\n| Baseline (TSN) | 2D ResNet-50 |  43.0  |      23.9       |   16.9   |   42.0   |\n| Our CT-Net     | 2D ResNet-50 |  37.3  |      21.0       | **50.1** | **78.8** |\n| Baseline (TSN) | InceptionV3  |  45.8  |      22.1       |   18.3   |   43.9   |\n| Our CT-Net     | InceptionV3  |  43.9  |      20.9       |   47.2   |   76.1   |\n\n------\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1771/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1771/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CT-Net: Channel Tensorization Network for Video Classification", "authorids": ["~Kunchang_Li1", "~Xianhang_Li1", "~Yali_Wang1", "~Jun_Wang7", "~Yu_Qiao1"], "authors": ["Kunchang Li", "Xianhang Li", "Yali Wang", "Jun Wang", "Yu Qiao"], "keywords": ["Video Classification", "3D Convolution", "Channel Tensorization"], "abstract": "3D convolution is powerful for video classification but often computationally expensive, recent studies mainly focus on decomposing it on spatial-temporal and/or channel dimensions.

As indicated in the work of X3D, the performance gain from using more clips (i.e. >5x10) in evaluation is small. Nevertheless, most approaches are evaluated with 30 clips on Kinetics. I would suggest sticking to this general practice for fair comparison.**\n\n**A4:** Thanks for your suggestion. To avoid misleading, we have updated the expressions of GFLOPs in our paper (Table 4 on page 8). There are two main reasons why we report our results using 3$\\times$4 clips.\n\nFirst, for SOTA comparison, we should report the best setting of all the models, instead of the same setting. In fact, it is not appropriate to report the same setting for SOTA, due to different designs of various models. For example, SlowFast [4] uses many more frames than any other models to boost accuracy. Hence, we report our best results using 3$\\times$4 clips.\n\nSecond, the reviewer mentioned the claim that, the performance gain from using more clips (actually i.e., >1$\\times$5 clips where \u20181\u2019 means center crop) is small. This claim mainly works for X3D[1], not for all the 3D models. For example, SlowFast 8$\\times$8-R101-NL [4] has 1% accuracy improvement from 1$\\times$5 to 1$\\times$10, as shown in Fig.3 of the X3D paper. Nevertheless, all these methods achieve the best accuracy with 3$\\times$10 clips. This is why they report 3$\\times$10 clips for SOTA comparison. Alternatively, it is not quite applicable to our CT-Net. In fact, the 3$\\times$10 setting of our CT-Net is slightly worse than the 3$\\times$4 setting (top-1 accuracy of 3$\\times$10 vs. 3$\\times$4: 78.7% vs. 78.8%). Hence, we report our CT-Net with its best accuracy setting. This is the same best-accuracy strategy as other methods.\n\n------\n\n**Q5:  Table 3 and 4 miss some existing SOTA approaches such as X3D [1], CorrNet [2] and TAM [3], which should be listed for reference.**\n\n**A5:** Thanks for these references. We have added these discussions in the updated paper (Table 3 on page 7 and Table 4 on page 8). First, our CT-Net outperforms CorrNet [2] and TAM [3]. For example, our CT-Net-50 is better than CorrNet-50 [2] on Something-Something V1 (top-1 accuracy: 51.7% vs 49.3%). It also outperforms TAM [3] on Kinetics-400 (top-1 accuracy: 77.3% vs. 72.0%). Second, we can achieve comparable top-1 accuracy with X3D [1] (our CT-Net-R101 vs. X3D-XL: 78.8% vs. 79.1%), under the similar GFLOPs (our CT-Net-R101 vs. X3D-XL: 1746 vs. 1452). However, X3D requires extensive model searching with an expensive GPU setting, while our CT-Net can be trained traditionally with feasible computation. \n\n------\n\n[1] Christoph Feichtenhofer.

The idea of this architecture is the tensorization of mid-level input features in combination with an attention mechanism that allows to select relevant features. the channel tensorization can be used as intermediate building block e.g. in a ResNet alternately with a Res block.\nThe ablation study is done on Something-Something V1 and the overall method is compared to state-of-the-art on Something-Something V1&V2 and Kinetics-400 and is able to outperform other lightweight architecture with comparable size.\n\n\nPaper strengths\n\n- I think the ideas proposed in this paper are interesting and I would not be aware of any architecture that would use a similar arrangement of tensorization and attention in the mid-layer part to allow for a lightweight 3D convolution architecture.\n\n- The paper shows competitive results on Something-Something as well as on Kinetics-400\n\n- The visualization supports the claim that the attention mechanism seems to learn to focus more on relevant parts of the video clip.  \n\n\nPaper weakness\n\n- The paper does not introduce a new technique per se, but manages to combine known elements. So there might be the issue of limited novelty. \n\nConclusion\n\nI think that the overall idea of reducing the computational load in 3d convolution architectures is a valid and important topic, as simply increasing networks and training data is not working for the majority of tasks. Therefore, lightweight but powerful architectures have a need in the field.

While this provides interesting technical questions from the algorithmic perspective, from the point of view of the novelty, the paper does not appear as a strong technical contribution.\n\nAnother downside of the proposed approach is that it is not sufficiently validated by experiments. Firstly, the contribution of TE is not separated in Table 3 and 4, so it remains unclear whether the performance improvement is due to the enhanced channel interactions or channel attention. Secondly, the approach seems to be only effective when the number of dimensions is low, leaving it difficult to fully justify the advantages of high-dimensional channel tensorization claimed in the paper.\n\nThe FLOPs of the proposed approach in Table 4 is somewhat misleading. As indicated in the work of X3D, the performance gain from using more clips (i.e. >5x10) in evaluation is small. Nevertheless, most approaches are evaluated with 30 clips on Kinetics. I would suggest sticking to this general practice for fair comparison.  \n\nTable 3 and 4 miss some existing SOTA approaches such as X3D [1], CorrNet [3] and TAM [3], which should be listed for reference. \n\n1) Christoph Feichtenhofer.

Unfortunately,  most approaches fail to achieve a preferable balance between convolutional efficiency and feature-interaction sufficiency.  For this reason,  we propose a concise and novel Channel Tensorization Network (CT-Net),  by treating the channel dimension of input feature as a multiplication of K sub-dimensions. On one hand,  it naturally factorizes convolution in a multiple dimension way,  leading to a light computation burden.  On the other hand, it can effectively enhance feature interaction from different channels,  and progressively enlarge the 3D receptive field of such interaction to boost classification accuracy.  Furthermore, we equip our CT-Module with a Tensor Excitation (TE) mechanism. It can learn to exploit spatial, temporal and channel attention in a high-dimensional manner, to improve the cooperative power of all the feature dimensions in our CT-Module. Finally, we flexibly adapt ResNet as our CT-Net. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging video benchmarks, e.g., Kinetics-400, Something-Something V1 and V2.
