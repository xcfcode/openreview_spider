However, all reviewers had some significant concerns about the utility of the method. In particular, reviewers were concerned that the method does not show a significant gain over the Adam algorithm (which is simpler/cheaper and easier to implement). The public reviewer also points out that there are many existing quasi-Newton methods designed for DL, so it is up to the authors to compared to at least one of these. For these reasons I'm recommending rejection at this time."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "L-SR1: A Second Order Optimization Method for Deep Learning", "abstract": "We describe L-SR1, a new second order method to train deep neural networks.

One of our primary claims in this paper is that the indefinite Hessian approximation can help navigate saddle points better. In this regard, it was more important for us to compare our approach with more widely used first order methods. We hope to compare our approach to the recent stochastic second order methods in future.\n\nWe have changed our language from stochastic second order methods 'require larger minibatches' to 'can benefit from larger minibatches'.\n\nWe changed \"Finally, popular quasi-Newton approaches such as L-BFGS, require line search to make parameter updates, which requires many more gradient and/or function evaluations.\" to \"Finally, popular quasi-Newton approaches such as L-BFGS (in their default form), require line search to make parameter updates, which requires many more gradient and/or function evaluations.\"\n\nWe measured the frequency of skipped updates for L-SR1 and had some interesting observations from our experiments. To summarize, in most cases, updates were never skipped, and if they were, it was less than 2.5% of the time. We did notice an abnormally high proportion of skipped updates for the case of MNIST with batch normalization (ranging from 7% to higher than 60%), which somehow did not seem to affect performance adversely.

For the case of residual networks on CIFAR10, we chose the same mini-batch size of 128 that was used by He et al. in their paper 'Deep residual learning for image recognition'.\n- The initial SR1 matrix was always the identity matrix, i.e. \\gamma = 1. We followed the typical convention followed for L-BFGS, where the initial inverse Hessian approximation H_0 is set to the identity matrix. \n- The function values you see at the beginning of each experiment, are in fact the function values at the end of the first epoch (epoch 0 in our case). Furthermore, the network parameters were randomly initialized for the LeNet like network experiments, and they were initialized according to  'Delving deep into rectifiers: Surpass- ing human-level performance on imagenet classification' by He et al., for the residual network experiments.

The paper is missing references for a large body of stochastic quasi-Newton methods and at times, is a bit misleading with its claims. \n\nReferences:\nA Self-Correcting Variable-Metric Algorithm for Stochastic Optimization (ICML, 2016): http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/curtis16.html\nadaQN: An Adaptive Quasi-Newton Algorithm for Training RNNs (ECML, 2016): http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_1 \nStochastic Quasi-Newton Methods for Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization: https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1196\n\nThese are specifically for deep learning/non-convex optimization. There are other methods like oLBFGS, RES (Mokhtari et. al.) and SQN (Byrd et. al.) for convex problems. The first and second references above have numerical experiments where they show that the L-BFGS variants work well as compared to first-order methods specifically for deep learning tasks. The authors should have opted for either of these three papers for their baselines instead of the older \u201cforgetting\u201d-based approach from 2011 since they improve upon this work and are more up-to-date with deep learning trends/heuristics. \n\nOther comments: \nOn Page 3, the authors claim \u201c...suggest that the approximate Hessian matrices generated by the SR1 method show faster progress towards the true Hessian than those generated by BFGS. This suggests that a limited memory SR1 method (L-SR1, if you like) would potentially outperform L-BFGS in the task of high dimensional optimization in neural network training.\u201d The argument that SR1 matrices better converge to the true Hessian is understood but the implication that it must hence perform better is misleading. BFGS updating has strong properties about self-correction (even in the stochastic case as in the first reference above) and superlinear convergence which are not true for SR1 (see for e.g., pp. 160-161 of Nocedal and Wright). \n\nOn Page 1, the authors claim that \u201cDue to their use of curvature information, they can often find good minima in far fewer steps than first order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, stochastic second order methods typically require larger mini-batches (Le et al., 2011)\u201d. This is not true. Most of the recent algorithms leveraging stochastic quasi-Newton framework (see above) operate reasonably well with batch-sizes similar to SGD. Similarly, the authors claim that \u201cFinally, popular quasi-Newton approaches such as L-BFGS, require line search to make parameter updates, which requires many more gradient and/or function evaluations.\u201d. With the newer body of work, this is not true and a constant or diminishing step-size rule often suffices both practically and for theoretical guarantees.\n \nOn Page 3, for instance, they claim that \u201c...SR1 performs well by skipping the update if the denominator is small, which does not occur very often anyway\u201d. While it is true that skipping for SR1 is less disastrous than skipping for BFGS and that generally is less frequent, maybe the authors could add details about how frequently they skipped updates for their MNIST/CIFAR runs. The reason for this is that if the algorithm skips continuously (or for a majority of the duration), the added cost is not justified given that the performance is similar to NAG. \n\nThere are a few minor issues with the numerical results. \n-The authors fail to explain how the batch sizes were chosen in the experiments conducted for the methods they compare against.\n-What was the initial SRI matrix used? In Algorithm 1, the authors mention \\gamma I, how was gamma chosen?\n-Why are the function values at the beginning of each experiment not the same across all methods?"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "L-SR1: A Second Order Optimization Method for Deep Learning", "abstract": "We describe L-SR1, a new second order method to train deep neural networks.
