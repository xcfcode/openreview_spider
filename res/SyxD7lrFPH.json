We respond to them one by one:\n\n1. We will explain anti-aliasing in our updated paper. Roughly, anti-aliasing is helpful for signal reconstruction. However, we can\u2019t provide a strict treatment of how anti-aliasing relates to classification. But we have intuitions: first, we believe reconstruction relates to classification (see our next response); second, frequency components are orthogonal. Aliasing means different components are mixed again. This may mislead the next layers for processing. \n\n2. To our knowledge, researchers haven\u2019t fully understood the whole process of image classification until now. Thus, we can\u2019t provide a strict treatment of how reconstruction optimality relates to classification optimality. But we have intuitions and empirical evidence of their relation: convolution layers are used to transform a signal which makes it easier to be classified. So if we accept that the feature extracted by previous convolution layers is useful, then it is best to keep it as much as possible for the current pooling layer. In this way, it is reasonable to assume that reconstruction optimality is consistent with classification optimality. On the other hand, it is difficult to directly define classification optimality for an intermediate layer. Moreover, several works, such as [1] have shown that using self reconstruction loss as an auxiliary is helpful for classification.\n\n3.  Please refer to our general response. With suitable settings, the shift consistency of F-pooling is much better.\n\n[1] Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Networks, NIPS2015"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhd.zhang.ai@gmail.com", "zhengzk@xidian.edu.cn"], "title": "Frequency Pooling: Shift-Equivalent and Anti-Aliasing Down Sampling", "authors": ["Zhendong Zhang", "Cheolkon Jung"], "pdf": "/pdf/94ce0e13157bb4dc5f08b943a83ed15ea379bd35.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional layer utilizes the shift-equivalent prior of images which makes it a great success for image processing.

We are sorry that our paper is written in a hurry. We accept that some contents are not explained well and the experiments are weak in the current version of this paper. \n\nHowever, we defend the value and novelty of our work in the following aspects:\n\n1. We believe shift-equivalence is very important for CNNs. Our work aims to recovery this property of CNNs which are destroyed by down sampling in a principle way. We provide theoretical guarantees of optimal anti-aliasing and shift equivalence.\n\n2. Although everyone talks about shift-equivalence, we find there is no strict definition of it for CNNs when down sampling is involved. We have shown that a corresponding up sampling operation must be involved in the strict definition. We also have shown that this up sampling operation plays an important role when we prove the properties of F-pooling. We believe a formal definition and a mathematical treatment have great value for academic research.\n\n3. Some reviewers mention that F-pooling is not consistently better than AA-pooling. But we never claim that F-pooling must beat AA-pooling. We choose AA-pooling just to provide a performance reference of the recently proposed method in this topic. Experiments in Tab 1-3 are consistently better than the baseline. We think this is enough to show the effectiveness of F-pooling. \n\n4. We choose image classifications to evaluate F-pooling just because it is commonly used and is easy to implement. There are some computer vision applications where shift-equivalence plays a more important role, such as object detection and object tracking. In those applications, F-pooling may be more valuable.\n\n************************************************************************************************\nWe apologize again because we make a terrible mistake when we test shift consistency. The consistency results in all table are incorrect. We have updated the correct values in our new pdf files. The relative order is similar as before.\n\nOne of the most important reasons why the consistency of F-pooling is not as good as we expect is that: F-pooling is designed to be circular shift equivalence. However, convolutional layers with zero paddings destroy circular shift equivalence. Thus, one should expect that using circular padding in convolutional layers will greatly increase the shift consistency of F-pooling.\n\nWhen we use circular padding, the shift consistency of F-pooling becomes much better. For ResNet18 on CIFAR100 with circular padding without shift argument, we have the following attractive results:\nBaseline:          60.47\nAA-pooling:      65.14\nF-pooling:         84.04\n\n************************************************************************************************\nWe will revise our paper based on your comments and update our paper during rebuttal. We plan to add more experiments to show the effect of F-pooling better. We also plan to submit our code during rebuttal.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhd.zhang.ai@gmail.com", "zhengzk@xidian.edu.cn"], "title": "Frequency Pooling: Shift-Equivalent and Anti-Aliasing Down Sampling", "authors": ["Zhendong Zhang", "Cheolkon Jung"], "pdf": "/pdf/94ce0e13157bb4dc5f08b943a83ed15ea379bd35.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional layer utilizes the shift-equivalent prior of images which makes it a great success for image processing.

Because we only change pooling layers while keeping others exactly the same. \n\nNow, we respond to your questions one by one:\n\n1. The results of AA-pooling and F-pooling are not the same. In Fig. 1, we show the results of average-pooling and F-pooling. If you carefully look at the corner of curves, you can find the differences. Without convolution, AA-pooling is similar to average-pooling (both of them are low-pass filters but with sightly different kernels. So AA-pooling gives different results for sine waves.\n\n2. We believe F-pooling plays a more important rule in applications where shift-equivalent is serious, such as object detection and object tracking. Because we need to predict the location or shifts of an image object. Moreover, F-pooling may be better for complex-valued CNNs, such as [1].\n\n3. The limitation of imaginary part is easy to overcome: set the resolution of F-pooling\u2019s output to an odd number or padding it to an odd number when the resolution is an even number. In this way, the imaginary part is zero. Moreover, the word shift in this paper means circular shift. So it is better to use circular padding in convolutional layers. However, we find circular padding slower the training speed in PyTorch. If we use zero paddings as in most situations, the beneficial of F-pooling is reduced. Our current experiments use zero paddings. See our general response for what happens when we replace zero paddings with circular padding.\n\n4. In all experiments of our current paper, the imaginary part is already ignored. \n\nWe can\u2019t directly measure how the imaginary part affects the performance unless we use complex-valued CNNs. Ignoring this part will destroy the reconstruction optimality, but the effect is small. Suppose the output size of F-pooling is 2N+1. We first transform a signal into frequency domain and keep 2N+1 components with the lowest frequencies: f(-N), \u2026 , f(0), \u2026 ,f(N). Then we transform it back into time domain. In this case, the imaginary part in time domain is zero because of symmetry. Now, suppose the output size is 2N+2: f(-N), \u2026 , f(0), \u2026 f(N), f(N+1). In this case, the imaginary part is not zero. However, if we set f(N+1) to 0, it imaginary part becomes zero again. Thus, the error of ignoring imaginary part is not larger than ||f(N+1)||. Fig.4 shows an example of odd and even output size of F-pooling.\n\n[1] Deep complex networks, ICLR2018\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhd.zhang.ai@gmail.com", "zhengzk@xidian.edu.cn"], "title": "Frequency Pooling: Shift-Equivalent and Anti-Aliasing Down Sampling", "authors": ["Zhendong Zhang", "Cheolkon Jung"], "pdf": "/pdf/94ce0e13157bb4dc5f08b943a83ed15ea379bd35.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional layer utilizes the shift-equivalent prior of images which makes it a great success for image processing.

The authors first derived the theory of F-pooling to be optimal anti-aliasing down sampling and is shift-equivalent in sec 2, and then demonstrated the experimental results of 1D signals and image classification tasks. \n\nThe experimental results are actually less impressive than what are claimed in contribution and conclusion. The authors stated that \"F-pooling remarkably increases accuracy and robustness w.r.t. shifts of moderns CNNs\"; however, in Table 1-3, the winning margin of accuracy is actually quite small (<2%), and the consistency (<3.5% compared to the second best baseline except resnet-18 on CIFAR 100 has large improvement ~7-8%). \n\nQuestions:\n1. For the experiment of 1D signal on sine wave, the AA-pooling and F-pooling give the same result? \n2. Compared to AA-pooling, it seems that F-pooling has a better theoretical guarantee (i.e. the optimal anti-aliasing down sampling operation given U). But other than this, the empirical performance seem not showing particular advantage over AA-pooling. Are there any other advantages for F-pooling s.t. people might want to use it as opposed to AA-pooling?\n3. What are the limitations of the F-pooling? It is good to me that the authors discuss one limitation on the imaginary part of output and I would like to hear more on other potential limitations for this method. \n- also, if the authors can explain more on sec 2.5 it will be helpful. If we simply ignore the imaginary part, although the theory is not applicable, but what would the empirical performance be? \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2215/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["zhd.zhang.ai@gmail.com", "zhengzk@xidian.edu.cn"], "title": "Frequency Pooling: Shift-Equivalent and Anti-Aliasing Down Sampling", "authors": ["Zhendong Zhang", "Cheolkon Jung"], "pdf": "/pdf/94ce0e13157bb4dc5f08b943a83ed15ea379bd35.pdf", "abstract": "Convolutional layer utilizes the shift-equivalent prior of images which makes it a great success for image processing.

Taking the perspective from signal processing, this paper proposes a pooling operation called frequency pooling (F-pooling). The key motivation is to make the pooling operation shift-equivalent and anti-aliasing. This paper gives an improved definition on shift-equivalent functions and shows that the proposed F-pooling is optimal in the sense of reconstructing the orignal signal. The F-pooling is then implemented with matrix multiplications and tested with recent convolutional neural networks for image classifiation on CIFAR-100 and a subset of ImageNet dataset. \n\nIt is interesting to take the perspective from signal processing to give pooling operation in CNN a formal treatment. As indicated in the recent literature, enforcing shift-invariance does help to improve the performance of a CNN on classification accuracy and the robustness with respect to image shift. At the same time, this work can be further enhanced at the following aspects:\n1. This work can make it clearer in principle how anti-aliasing contributes to improving the classification performance and robustness. This will help to make this paper more self-contained. \n2. When showing the optimality of F-pooling in Section 2.3, the criterion is to reconstruct the original signal x. Considering that the ultimate goal is classification, the information to be maximally preserved through each operation through the layers shall be the information that relates to the class label y. In light of this, some justification and explanation shall be provided for using this criterion for optimality.\n3. The experimental study is weak. Experiments could be conducted on more benchmark datasets with more CNN architectures to convincingly show the effectiveness of the proposed F-pooling. Also, from the three Tables in the experimental part, the improvement of F-pooling over AA-pooling (developed by the main reference of this work) does not seem to be significant or consistent. For example, in Table 2, the F-pooling only wins at either accuracy (marginally) or consistency, but not both. In Table 3, the F-pooling consistently shows inferior classification performance, although obtaining slightly higher consistency. This makes the advantage of F-pooling over the existing AA-pooling unclear.
