The PI loss is regularized to have orthogonal latent space. It is further improved by summing the PI loss applied at multiple scales, and by adding a masked reconstruction (MR) loss. The paper presents results on three domains, with speech recognition as the main one. \nThe paper presents a nice extension of DCA, as well as a probabilistic interpretation motivated by the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. It is clearly written with good citations of previous work. \n\nOn the other hand, The experimental section requires more work. Here are some directions for improvements: \n1) Adding the MR loss, combines another effective pre-training mechanize from previous work. I'm assuming that in tables 1 and 2, DAPC (written alone) refers to models optimizing the PI loss without MR (please correct me if this is not true). If my understanding is correct, the PI loss doesn't require MR to avoid degenerate solutions. Further analysis for the ASR models would help the readers understand different cases when the MR is required. \n2) Following on the previous point, table 1 is missing the MR only results in the upper section, and missing the DAPC only in the section section. This is important to understand the relative contribution of each pre-training loss.\n3) In table 2, the reported results are using a 30M parameter model compared to larger previously published models (~150M parameters). Given that the results of the proposed model is worse than those larger models, it is not clear why the authors didn't pre-train larger models of similar capacity for fairer comparison to their proposed approach. It is known that pre-training larger models yield better final representations for downstream tasks. Would it be the case for DAPC? \n4) The pre-training on librispeech only is done for a 1 epoch. This seems pretty short compared to prior pre-training work on the same dataset (correct me if this is not accurate). Do the learned representations using DPAC stop improving after 1 epoch of pre-training? If possible, please share results of pre-training for larger number of epochs for the DPAC only, MR only, and combined loss. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Sequence Data with Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components", "authorids": ["~Junwen_Bai1", "~Weiran_Wang1", "~Yingbo_Zhou1", "~Caiming_Xiong1"], "authors": ["Junwen Bai", "Weiran Wang", "Yingbo Zhou", "Caiming Xiong"], "keywords": ["Mutual Information", "Unsupervised Learning", "Sequence Data", "Masked Reconstruction"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space.

The hypothesis is interesting, and has some benefits, specifically that it does not require contrasting with negatives unlike many recent SSL methods. \n\nMost experiments performed on the speech recognition task. While the theory and discussion looks plausible, the experiments are somewhat on the weak side. Specifically:\n\n1) the differences in word error rates in the ablations are pretty small. The authors claim to run 3 seeds for each result and report the mean - can we see the standard deviation?\n2) why not compare to wsj results from cpc-style training such as wav2vec and vq-wav2vec?\n3) eval on Librispeech is only on the clean set. Why not show results on noisy, where differences between techniques should be somewhat more apparent?\n4) there are newer models to compare against, e.g. wav2vec 2.0\n5) the authors claim that they perform worse than e.g. BERT + vq-wav2vec because their model is smaller. But they use standard transformers as their backbone - it should be straight forward to scale this up and have apples to apples comparison.\n6) this is positioned as a general SSL technique - what about experiments in other modalities like nlp or vision?\n7) is \"DAPC\" just the PI loss without masked reconstruction? (i am not sure if \"shifted recon\" just adds the shifting, or it adds the entire reconstruction dimension). I think that is the case, but i am not 100% sure - maybe its worth to make this more clear.\n\nOverall I liked the premise of the paper but unfortunately the experiments left me unconvinced in the value of this approach and its various components\n\nUpdate:\nthanks for your reply. i remain not fully convinced of the improvements with the proposed method and i look forward to additional experiments in NLP. i do think this approach is valuable for additional study however and updated my rating to reflect this", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Sequence Data with Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components", "authorids": ["~Junwen_Bai1", "~Weiran_Wang1", "~Yingbo_Zhou1", "~Caiming_Xiong1"], "authors": ["Junwen Bai", "Weiran Wang", "Yingbo Zhou", "Caiming Xiong"], "keywords": ["Mutual Information", "Unsupervised Learning", "Sequence Data", "Masked Reconstruction"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space.

Using PI alone as the learning objective often achieves reasonable performance (see Figure 2, Table 1, Figure 5, Table 5), yet the latent space can lose information of the inputs and can be improved with a reconstruction loss; this is what we meant by \u201cdegeneracy\u201d, and we do not refer \u201cdegeneracy\u201d to difficulty in numerical optimization.  We were just trying to compare DAPC with CPC-like methods from a high-level to give the readers a big picture and stress on the key differences. DAPC is only similar to contrastive learning in that both model mutual information. Beyond this point, DAPC is quite different from contrastive methods. **(b)** Our loss function has 2 parts---PI-based loss and reconstruction-based loss---and either of them can be seen as the regularization to the other. AFAIK, we are the first to introduce PI for deep representation learning, and we focus more on it since the readers might be less familiar with it.  **(c)** We agree that PI can potentially be useful in a variety of methods, e.g., as we show for deep generative models in Sec 2.3. \n\n2. For Sec 4.1 and 4.2, we used the best tuned DCA parameters from the original paper (Clark et al. 2019), and we further tuned the parameters like window size T based on a grid search for the applications we had. For these experiments, CPC has been extensively tuned as shown in the revision (Table 6 and Figure 6). For Sec 4.3, we mostly quote numbers from prior work that experimented with the same setup, including the wav2vec series which mainly implements the CPC loss. Wav2vec series however, use larger model architecture and much heavier tuning, see our general response. In contrast, we only carefully tuned PI only and MR only methods given that they are components of DAPC, and the trade-off parameter for them in the final loss. The comparisons are quite fair.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Sequence Data with Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components", "authorids": ["~Junwen_Bai1", "~Weiran_Wang1", "~Yingbo_Zhou1", "~Caiming_Xiong1"], "authors": ["Junwen Bai", "Weiran Wang", "Yingbo Zhou", "Caiming Xiong"], "keywords": ["Mutual Information", "Unsupervised Learning", "Sequence Data", "Masked Reconstruction"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space.

In this approach, the model learns to maximize the predictive information, which is the mutual information between past and future time windows. In order to avoid degenerate solutions, the proposed approach relies on a second loss that optimizes masked reconstructions.\n\nStrengths:\n* The paper is written clearly and is easy to follow. \n* The proposed method seems to outperform the baselines across all considered tasks.\n* The usage of predictive information as an objective on the latent representations is well motivated and seems to improve performance over a non-regularized autoencoder.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper focuses exclusively on one interpretation of their approach, in which the optimization of the predictive information is the main objective and the reconstruction loss merely pushes the model to avoid degenerate solutions. Explicitly considering the reverse interpretation, in which the predictive information is a regularizer applied to an autoencoder to enforce a better latent structure, could provide more depth to the paper: \n    1) Following this interpretation, it would make sense to include more references in the related works section describing autoencoding approaches for representation learning.\n    2) Based on this interpretation, it would also be interesting to investigate the effect that the predictive information regularizer has on the autoencoding model. This is partially done in section 4.3, but missing from the other two experiments. \n    3) Based on this interpretation, the probabilistic interpretation of DAPC (sec 2.3) can be reduced to describing a standard VAE with additional regularization on the latent space in the form of predictive information.\n\n* The experiments show strong results for the proposed DAPC. However, it remains unclear how much fine-tuning has been done for the DAPC, especially in comparison to the baselines. For example, I would imagine that the CPC model might perform better on the lorenz attractor (Fig. 2) when optimizing the parameter k (which influences the temporal lag between the positive samples). The experiments would provide a much stronger point for the superiority of DAPC if there was a clear outline of the considered hyperparameters for all models. Additionally, details, such as the employed model architectures, that would be needed for reproducing the results are missing.\n\nAdditional comment:\nIn the related work section, the paper states \u201cUnlike prior work, our principle for sequence representation learning is to maximize the MI between the past and future latent representations, rather than the MI between representations and inputs.\u201d.

Some of our clarifications to your concerns:\n\n1. DAPC is the combination of predictive information (PI) and masked reconstruction (MR). Table 1 and 2 are showing further variations of PI and MR, multi-scale PI and shifted MR. But DAPC itself also comprises PI and MR. We have added MR only and PI only results in Table 1. Please check it out and the results show that PI alone is not good enough. For the other 2 applications, we also added experiments in Table 5, Figure 5, Table 7 to show PI can greatly boost the performance of different reconstruction schemes while on the other hand, PI alone fails to provide meaningful results. We would appreciate it if you can take a look at the tables and figures.\n\n2. In Table 1, we add PI-only and MR-only results in the upper section and DAPC-only results in the lower section.\n\n3. Please refer to the general comment. We can not do apples to apples comparison due to limits on computational resources.\n\n4. This is a subtle point. Any pretraining method uses some objective to learn useful features, which eventually is not aligned with downstream ASR and thus a stopping criterion/model selection strategy is needed. Another complication for us comes from the ESPNet asr pipeline we use, which combines attention and CTC with interplay between the two. On WSJ, we found that attention and ctc prefer different pretraining epochs; attention benefits from longer pretraining (e.g., 50 epochs) than CTC (e.g, 5 epochs). Thus for the hybrid attention + ctc model we pick the epoch that leads to overall best dev WER performance.  For the combined DAPC loss, in the pretrain on 81 hours and finetune on 15 hours setup (and a single random seed), pretraining epoch 1 leads to dev WER 12.2%, epoch 3 gives 12.0%, epoch 5 gives 12.4%, and epoch 20 gives 12.4%.\nOn Librispeech the best pretraining epoch is 1, but this is partly because we used a quite small batch size (up to 32 utterances), and we actually have done 30K updates for pretraining.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Sequence Data with Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components", "authorids": ["~Junwen_Bai1", "~Weiran_Wang1", "~Yingbo_Zhou1", "~Caiming_Xiong1"], "authors": ["Junwen Bai", "Weiran Wang", "Yingbo Zhou", "Caiming Xiong"], "keywords": ["Mutual Information", "Unsupervised Learning", "Sequence Data", "Masked Reconstruction"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space.

Here are some of our clarifications:\n\n1. We have added a table 10 to show the key properties of the major methods we compare against in the ASR pretraining task. Some of these methods may have variations with different properties and we list the original versions. Besides variants of our methods and CPC, we have used PCA, SFA and DCA for the other two tasks, which are deterministic and non-contrastive.\n\n2. Most results are quoted from the same scenarios in corresponding papers directly, as in Table 2 for LibriSpeech and Table 9 for WSJ. Perhaps except for the wav2vec series which is clearly larger, models of compared methods have sizes of the same scale and similar architecture (which can also be inferred from the computational resources used to train them).\n\n3. We have added table 5 and 7 for more observations on full reconstruction. Full reconstruction is useful in most scenarios but it is outperformed by masked reconstruction in general.\nIt has also been observed for the ASR pretraining task that the full reconstruction task is too easy to learn useful features (see Wang et al 2020, section 4.2, second paragraph), since the powerful encoder gets to see all the input context. On the other hand, masked reconstruction forces the model to learn contextual information."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Sequence Data with Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components", "authorids": ["~Junwen_Bai1", "~Weiran_Wang1", "~Yingbo_Zhou1", "~Caiming_Xiong1"], "authors": ["Junwen Bai", "Weiran Wang", "Yingbo Zhou", "Caiming Xiong"], "keywords": ["Mutual Information", "Unsupervised Learning", "Sequence Data", "Masked Reconstruction"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space.

As you can see, the wav2vec series have regularly used 64 or more GPUs for training a single model, and their language models can be very large for best performance (e.g., wav2vec 2.0 used a transformer LM with 20 layers and 16 attention heads); such model sizes make tuning extremely time consuming. Our models have reasonable sizes that allow most thorough analysis with the resources we have, and our baselines already outperform most existing methods with similar model sizes.\n\nWe would like to reiterate that the purpose of our paper is to propose a general representation learning method for sequence data, beyond just the speech domain, and we hope the reader will also appreciate the other experiments, i.e., Lorenz attractor and the forecasting tasks, which were used in previous work.\n\nWe have also replied to each reviewer\u2019s comment separately.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper544/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Representation Learning for Sequence Data with Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components", "authorids": ["~Junwen_Bai1", "~Weiran_Wang1", "~Yingbo_Zhou1", "~Caiming_Xiong1"], "authors": ["Junwen Bai", "Weiran Wang", "Yingbo Zhou", "Caiming Xiong"], "keywords": ["Mutual Information", "Unsupervised Learning", "Sequence Data", "Masked Reconstruction"], "abstract": "We propose Deep Autoencoding Predictive Components (DAPC) -- a self-supervised representation learning method for sequence data, based on the intuition that useful representations of sequence data should exhibit a simple structure in the latent space.
