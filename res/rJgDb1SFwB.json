My main concern is the questionable role of attention in making the model more interpretable (which is the main contribution of the paper).\n\n###########################\n\nThe paper proposes a new model for automated sepsis detection using multitask GP and attention-based GP. The sepsis detection problem is of paramount importance in the clinical domain and the authors rightly emphasized that point. Also the paper tries to combine interpretability with prediction accuracy by using attention mechanism. \n\nThe paper is generally well written and well motivated; however, in terms of technical novelty and empirical evidence the paper can be further improved. \n\nThe MGP-AttnTCN model is mostly a minor modification of the model proposed by Moor et al. 2019 and has the additional attention element to be more interpretable. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not easy for an ICLR reader without any medical background to evaluate the validity of the interpretability results provided in the paper. Furthermore, the recent works in NLP have agued against the value of attention for interpretability (see for instance \u201cAttention is not Explanation\u201d by Jain & Wallace 2019). That said, I believe the paper is probably a better fit for a machine learning in healthcare venue (such as MLHC). \n\nIn terms of empirical evidence of the prediction accuracy the paper only compares with Moor et al 2019 (which does not show a significant improvement in the realistic setting) and a much older InSight paper (2016). This would have been typically enough for a paper with major technical novelty; however, for this paper, I believe adding more recent baselines and discussing the advantages of the method over these baselines would be necessary. \n\nMinor:\nCaption in Figure 1 can be more informative and useful for the reader if you add more details on different parts of the model. \n\u201cGraphically, once can observe\u201d should be \u201cone can observe\u201d .

We are going to respond to your comments in the following.\n\nNew sepsis labels:\nRegarding the different labelling of the data, we will make the code available once the paper will be reviewed - as it is now on a (non anonymous) github repository. As such, the labelling is part of the contributions of the paper.\nThe decision to have zero contributions reflects that we assume a patient is healthy unless proven otherwise. This is in line with the official Sepsis-3 guidelines, which claim that \u201cthe baseline SOFA score can be assumed to be zero in patients not known to have preexisting organ dysfunction.\u201d (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2492881, Box 3). Our assumption is that the authors of the Sepsis-3 guidelines are aware of possible clinical practices and have taken them and other clinical biases into consideration when fleshing out their recommendations. \nMoreover, as opposed to Moor et al who ignore cases that do not have complete data, our labels will also contain patients with fewer records and hence \u2018noisier\u2019 time series, but also a broader and more realistic use-case. On the other hand, only looking at well documented patients is not in line with the aim of the research stream: if a patient is already well attended, then doctors are already well aware of their health conditions and a diagnostic support tool would only bring marginal benefit.\n\nInterpolation in Figure 5:\nYour point on Figure 5 can be explained by the Multitask nature of the Gaussian Process: even if there is no input for that specific covariate, the model is able to infer its value from the other values it is able to record.\n\nMGP samples:\nRegarding the MC samples y_{MGP}, as written in the original paper, they are taken from the posterior over t\u2019 defined by \\mu and \\Sigma in equation (6) in order to approximate its distribution. Could you be more specific about which part is unclear? \n\nDimensionality of the latents:\nz_j and z_j\u2019 should be N x (M+Q), we amended the paper.

We also clustered the different features solely based on data sampling frequency, and found that two clusters were optimal: the clusters have low wss and are intuitive to the medical staff. It is especially given the latter point that we decided for two clusters instead of treating the number of covariances as a hyperparameter.\n\nInterpolation:\nAs per the interpolation of the signal, we would like to point out that even the most frequently sampled data is sampled every 15 minutes. As such, micro-movements in data would already be missing. However, in order to limit the amount of smoothing, we decided to use a kernel that has no moments greater than two. As such, these kernels are able to capture \u2018jumpier\u2019 behaviours.\n\nIf you have any further suggestions on how to improve the paper, please let us know.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1546/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1546/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MGP-AttTCN: An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for the Prediction of Sepsis", "authors": ["Margherita Rosnati", "Vincent Fortuin"], "authorids": ["mrosnati@ethz.ch", "fortuin@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["time series analysis", "interpretability", "Gaussian Processes", "attention neural networks"], "TL;DR": "We propose MGP-AttTCN: a joint multitask Gaussian Process and attention-based deep learning model to early predict the occurrence of sepsis in an interpretable  and robust manner.", "abstract": "With a mortality rate of 5.4 million lives worldwide every year and a healthcare cost of more than 16 billion dollars in the USA alone, sepsis is one of the leading causes of hospital mortality and an increasing concern in the ageing western world.

Unless the authors provide evidence that this is reasonable, it is not necessarily clear whether labels resulting from the proposed scheme will be biased and affected by differences in clinical practice at different sites or data collection practices. That being said, it is not clear whether the proposed labeling is a contribution from the work.\n\nThe fact that the proposed labels are harder to fit does not imply that the proposed labels are better or more reasonable. This provided that is difficult to know (without ground truth) whether the difficulty originates from a broader use case (not as easy as Moor et al (2019)) or labels being noisy, imperfect proxies for sepsis diagnosis. I understand the author's motivation for doing it, however, their approach is not sufficiently justified. I also agree that predicting sepsis in a realistic setting is harder than suggested in prior work, however, the proposed labeling does not necessarily yields evidence of that being the case.\n\nThe interpretation of the covariance matrices of the MGP is interesting, though not surprising considering that covariates in green are measured regularly while blue covariates are ordered sparingly.\n\nFigure 5 is interesting, though raises questions about of interpretability of the model. How should unobserved covariates be interpreted (INR in Figure 5)?\n\nIn summary, the contributions of the present work are not sufficiently justified (labeling), the novelty of the proposed model is minor, relative to MGP-TCN, and the added value of the attention mechanism as a means to interpret predictions in terms of the journey of a patient is not clear.\n\nMinor:\n- Figure 1 needs a better caption.

Also, they have provided a new labelling for the MIMIC-III dataset, which is of great value.\n\nUsually constraining the feature space reduces the accuracy, as one tends to miss important features. However, here, one is using a Gaussian model to generate a feature space that is easier to train with a neural network (by filling the sparse data by Gaussian process interpolation) but also augment the dataset.\n\nThe author report that his improves prediction. Unfortunately, I did not find tables of solutions where one could the actual impact. The authors should include a numerical table of their result comparison results.  Now there is only a narrative in section 5.3 and an image showing that at different covariance times, different feature groups starts to interpret the results. Obviously, a question arises if the model would perform even better with a combination of covariance times, or is there some covariance time range that is missing that would improve the result even more.\n\nThe Gaussian model creates smooth interpolation of data spaces and also forces the training to look at corresponding smoothened features - that are very good for human eyes. However, there are situations (like the detecting heart beat from a video from a head moving with a recoil from the blood rushing to the brain) in where the signal is too weak for human to see, but is definitely there for a computer.  I would state that this as interpretable,  as an explicitly visible signal would be. Even  shorter time constant signal might be valuable as well, but it would not be visible here...  It seems that in sepsis, it was a good idea, as it improves the result compared to the situation of not using the Gaussian model. \n\nOne has to be careful to state that this would address the interpretability of the results. Gaussian process by itself is not giving understanding nor interpretability as it is too general. But it can make the provided solution \"teachable\" to a human expert by showing what visible features one can track.\n\nCompare this to a situation where one is using physical model to regularize detection. It has the analogous two model structure like the one in the manuscript. In https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/SFV/index.html the authors of the paper report that that one can achieve a better pose estimation by constraining the pose to only those that are achievable by a physical model based policy trained by reinforcement learning. This one is able to \"interpret\" the pose.\n\nAs a summary, the authors have done solid and valuable work in improving the accuracy detection. They should have a more formal way to present the results and baseline comparisions as tables. On the explainability and interpretability, there remains a lot of interpretations and one has lots of explaining to do, even after this manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1546/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1546/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "MGP-AttTCN: An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for the Prediction of Sepsis", "authors": ["Margherita Rosnati", "Vincent Fortuin"], "authorids": ["mrosnati@ethz.ch", "fortuin@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["time series analysis", "interpretability", "Gaussian Processes", "attention neural networks"], "TL;DR": "We propose MGP-AttTCN: a joint multitask Gaussian Process and attention-based deep learning model to early predict the occurrence of sepsis in an interpretable  and robust manner.", "abstract": "With a mortality rate of 5.4 million lives worldwide every year and a healthcare cost of more than 16 billion dollars in the USA alone, sepsis is one of the leading causes of hospital mortality and an increasing concern in the ageing western world.
