All reviewers found the theoretical contribution of the paper interesting, and while there were problems raised regarding formalisation, they appear to have been adequately addressed in the revisions to the paper. The main concern in all three reviews surrounds the evaluation, and weakness thereof. The overarching point of contention seems to be that the theory relates to a particular formulation of RNNs (RAC), causing doubts that the results lift to other architectural variants which are used to obtain state-of-the-art results on tasks such as language modelling. It seems that the paper could be significantly improved by the provision of stronger empirical results to support the theory, or a more convincing argument as to why the results should transfer from, say, RAC to LSTMs. The authors point to two papers on the matter in their response, but it is not clear this is a substitute for experimental validation.

I do think the paper would benefit from experimental results, but agree with the authors that the theoretical results are non-trivial and interesting on their own merit.\n\n------------------------\nThe paper presents a theoretical analysis of depth in RNNs (technically a variant called RACs) i.e. stacking RNNs on top of one another, so that h_t^l (i.e. hidden state at time t and layer l is a function of h_t^{l-1} and h_{t-1}^{l})\n\nThe work is inspired by previous results for feed forward nets and CNNs. However, what is unique to RNNs is their ability to model long term dependencies across time. \n\nTo analyze this specific property, the authors propose a concept called \"start-end rank\" that essentially models the richness of the dependency between two disjoint subsets of inputs. Specifically, let S = {1, . . . , T/2} and E === {T/2 + 1, . . . , T}. sep_{S,E}(y) models the dependence between these two sets of time points. Specifically sep_{S,E}(y) = K means there exists g_s^k and g_e^k for k=1...K such that y(x) = \\sum_{k} g_s^k(x_S) g_e^k(x_E).\n\nTherefore sep_{S,E}(y) is the rank of a particular matricization of y (with respect to the partition S,E). If sep_{S,E}=1 then it is rank 1 (and would correspond to independence if y(x) was a probability distribution). A higher rank would correspond to more dependence across time. \n\n(Comment: I believe if I understood the above correctly, it would be easier to explain tensors/matricization first and then introduce separation rank, since I think it much makes it clearer to explain. Right now the authors explain separation rank first and then discuss tensors / matricization).\n\nUsing this concept, the authors prove that deep recurrent networks can express functions that have exponentially higher start/end ranks than shallow RNNs.\n\nI overall like the paper's theoretical results, but I have the following complaints:\n\n(1)  I have the same question as the other reviewer. Why is Theorem 1 not a function of L?  Do the papers that prove similar theorems about ConvNets able to handle general L? What makes this more challenging? I feel if comparing L=2 vs L=3 is hard, the authors should be more up front about that in the introduction/abstract.\n\n(2) I think it would have been stronger if the authors would have provided some empirical results validating their claims. \n\n", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Benefits of Depth for Long-Term Memory of Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "The key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is their ever-improving ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies.

Our main result (theorem 1),  rigorously proves a lower bound on the Start-End separation rank of depth L=2 recurrent networks. This proved L=2 lower bound also trivially applies to all networks of depth L>2, and thus constitutes a first of its kind exponential separation in memory capacity between deep recurrent networks and shallow ones. In the added subsection, we present a quantitative conjecture by which a tighter, depth dependent, lower bound holds for recurrent networks of depth L>2. We formally motivate this conjecture by the Tensor Networks construction of deep RACs. We emphasize that the originally submitted version included the Tensor Networks construction of deep RACs (Appendices A1-A3), which yields the added conjecture in a straightforward manner, as described in a newly added appendix section A4. Beyond this, the paper kept its original form. \n\nThis addition, which meets central questions raised by the reviewers, outlines further insight that is achieved by our analysis regarding the dependence of the Start-End separation rank on depth, and poses further investigation of this avenue as an open problem. We believe that the presented novel approach for theoretical analysis of long term memory in recurrent networks, along with the solidly proved main results separating L=2 deep networks from L=1 shallow networks, constitutes an important contribution, which is well-supplemented by the formally motivated conjecture in the added section 4.2."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Benefits of Depth for Long-Term Memory of Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "The key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is their ever-improving ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies.

Our response follows. \n\nRACs are brought forth in our paper as a theoretical platform to investigate more common RNNs. The depth related effects studied in this paper depend on the recurrent network's structure rather than on specific activations. Empirical support for the specific RAC activations can be found in [1], which we mention in the paper. There, Multiplicative Integration Networks are shown to outperform common RNNs with additive integration. In section 3.1 they investigate RNNs with only multiplicative gates (in our terms - RACs) and find they preform comparably to vanilla RNNs in [2]. Furthermore, reference [1] shows evidence that under multiplicative integration the effect of squashing nonlinearities is diminished as they mostly operate in their linear regime, as opposed to the additive case where they are heavily influential (Fig. 1 (c),(d)). \n\nThus, there is a clear empirical validation addressing the reviewer's concern, that RACs can be trained to perform relevant sequential tasks. Our paper merely uses RACs as surrogates to common RNNs and does not propose to use them in practice - even though, as shown in empirical studies mentioned above, they can be used in practice.\n\nReferences\n___________________________\n[1] Yuhuai Wu, Saizheng Zhang, Ying Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, and Ruslan R Salakhutdinov.

We address the reviewer's reservations below. \n\n1) The lower bound presented in the paper for a deep network is tied to the minimal case of L=2, which is the technical reason for the lower bound in theorem 1 lacking a dependence on L. We do not claim it is unachievable to receive specific bounds on  L=3 etc. However, we deem a separation between higher L's subsidiary in terms of the simple and unprecedented message of this paper, which brings forth a formal explanation for superiority of the prevalent architectural choice of stacked recurrent networks. Regarding the line of work that deals with depth separation in feed-forward neural networks, certainly there are important papers for which the formal results only separate between L=1 and higher L, such as the ones mentioned in the reply to reviewer 2. A separation between two networks of higher L's is of interest, however our work is the first to raise and formulate the depth efficiency question in terms of recurrent networks, and thus we consider the clear message attained by the presented separation in Theorem 1 important.\n\n2) As we emphasize in the paper, our analysis provides a theoretical framework for a phenomenon that is empirically well-established in the literature. Moreover, our main result in Theorem 1 specifically addresses the issue of enhanced long-term memory in deep recurrent networks, for which a comprehensive empirical study was presented by [1]. We refer to this study in the second paragraph of the introduction and in last paragraph of the conclusion. The work in [1] constitutes an empirical motivator for our work, which is positioned to provide a first of its kind theoretical perspective for the above findings. We found the methodological experimental indications in [1], strengthened by a variety of other empirical works which employ deep recurrent networks for demanding sequential tasks, sufficient. Thus, we did not include further experimental validations, which in our view were not required given the evidence in the literature cited in the paper. However, we would appreciate suggestions by the reviewer for experiments not present in the mentioned literature that are required for strengthening our presentation. Alternatively, we suggest to emphasize the existence of such supporting experiments in our introduction, so that their role in motivating our theoretical results is even clearer. \n\n\nReferences\n----------------\n[1] Michiel Hermans and Benjamin Schrauwen.

Following is our response. \n\nAddressing the reviewer's main comment, indeed Theorem 1 does not include a separation between two deep recurrent networks of different depths - our analysis refers to the enhanced memory capacity of multiple layered recurrent networks versus single layered recurrent networks. Our treatment is analogous to a much wider and more mature line of work that deals with depth separation in feed-forward neural networks. In the feed-forward domain, various important and widely accepted papers give results which only separate between shallow and deep networks in order to show the advantages of depth in these networks (such as [1,2]). Formal theoretical literature which provides any such similar results on recurrent networks is scarce at best, and such questions have not been answered (or formally asked) to date for recurrent networks. Our focus on separating between shallow and deep networks is the natural starting point for this line of research; Theorem 1, which establishes a separation in the ability to integrate data throughout time between shallow and deep recurrent networks, constitutes a first of its kind theoretical assertion of superiority of deep recurrent networks.  \n\nWe wish to emphasize that even once the question is raised - \"can the notion of depth enhanced long term-memory in recurrent networks be formalized?\" and a mathematical infrastructure is set-up in the form of the Start-End separation rank with grid tensors rank bounding it, establishing Theorem 1 is highly non-trivial. As can be seen in the supplementary material, the proof involves a considerable \"legwork\" which integrates tools and results from various fields (measure theory, tensorial analysis, combinatorics, graph theory and quantum physics). Accordingly, given the importance and contribution of the result in Theorem 1, we found the suggested task of separating the memory capacity of two arbitrary deep recurrent networks subsidiary in terms of contribution to the message of this paper. We agree that a finer investigation separating two recurrent networks of arbitrary depth is of relevance - it is in fact a part of a follow-up work, indicated by this paper, which we are presently pursuing (described in the last paragraph of the discussion section).\n\nRegarding the sub-comment made by the reviewer, our theoretical results guarantee that for almost any setting of the recurrent network's weights, theorem 1 holds. We have performed several sanity checks, which agreed with our conclusions. Having proved the theorem, we did not feel the need to include such empirical validations. However, we will gladly do so if it helps clarify or convey any message. We would appreciate a clarification regarding what specific convincing experiments the reviewer had in mind.\n\nReferences\n----------------\n[1] Olivier Delalleau and Yoshua Bengio.
