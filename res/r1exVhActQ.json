Achterhold et al.) are not as strong as our compared baseline \"Variational Dropout\". For example, for LeNet on Mnist, the former have ~0.65%, while the latter (and our result) are less than 0.4%, and for VGG on CIFAR-10, the former have ~5.5%, while the latter (and our result) are less than 2%. That is, both our method and VD has better results compared to the two related works.\n\nNote many results provided in (C. Louizos et al., 2017), (J. Achterhold et al.) are for simultaneous pruning and quantization, while our submission focuses more on investigating the pruning effect of the simple L1 regularizer. In this work, we focus on the weight pruning ratio without quantization.\n\n(2) About  comment \"Repeating the old story from other papers\":\n\nOur story focuses more on the analysis of \"problem\" instead of the \"algorithm\". In other words, we argue that different problems have different compression rate, depending on their number of supporting labels, when a simple L1-regularized pruning objective is used.  The algorithm we proposed is just a tool for helping our iterates getting closer to the stationary points.\n\n(3) About comment \"quite limited novelty\":\n\nFirstly, our novelty lies more on the analysis of the pruning objective than on the algorithm. Second, it is a wrong impression that we are proposing ADAM over SGD.  Our proposition for the algorithm is the \"L1 cumulative\" technique as a general extension module to modify any stochastic-gradient-based algorithms, such as SGD and ADAM, into a sparsity-inducing solver.\n\n(4) About comment \"lacking solid experiments\":\n\nThe sentence is an editorial mistake.

In particular it shows the stationary point of an l1 regularized layer has bounded non-zero elements. \n\nThe perspective of the proof is interesting: By chain rule, the stationary point satisfies nnz(W^j) linear equations, but the subgradients of the loss function w.r.t. the logits have at most N\\times ks variables. If the coefficients of the linear equation are distributed in general positions, then the number of variables should not be larger than the number of equations. \n\nWhile I mostly like the paper, I would like to point out some possible issues:\n\nmain concerns: \n\n1. the columns of V may not be independent during the optimization(training) process. In this situation, I am not quite sure if the assumption of \u201cgeneral position\u201d still holds. I understand that in literatures of Lasso and sparse coding it is common to assume \u201cgeneral position\u201d. But in those problems the coefficient matrix is not Jacobian from a learning procedure. \n\n2. the claim is a little bit counter intuitive: Theorem 1 claims the sparse inequality holds for any \\lambda. It is against the empirical observation that when lambda is extremely small, effect of the regularizer tends to be almost zero. Can authors also show this effects empirically, i.e., when the regularization coefficients decrease, the nnz does not vary much? (Maybe there is some optimization details or approximations I missed?)\n\nSome minor notation issues:\n1. in theorem 1: dim(W^{(j)})=d should be dim(vec(W^{(j)}))=d\n2. in theorem 1: Even though I understand what you are trying to say, I would suggest we describe the jacobian matrix V in details.
