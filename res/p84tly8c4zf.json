Below are our responses to the comments.\n\nRe(A). There is no detailed experimental analysis beyond comparing end performance of models trained with the proposed approaches.\n\nA: We provide the performance in the experiments since it is the most important and interesting result as many deep learning literature did. Besides, we have an experiment of Mixup with 3 or 10 images, showing that when the bias level is high (strong augmentation), the proposed method still can outperform the standard Mixup. We will add more results for ablation study in the final version.\n\nRe(B). a rich literature of recent data augmentation approaches that perform much better.\n\nA: We agree with the reviewer's concern about additional experiments. However, the main goal of this paper focuses on the theoretical analysis of how to better utilize data augmentation, and we use the empirical evaluations to verify the theoretical findings. Besides, the comparison between heuristic algorithms and theoretical algorithms sometimes is not fair. For example, as one popular augmentation technique, Auto-Augment focuses on learning a good policy among augmentations while we consider how to better use a given augmentation. Besides, the training process of Auto-Augment usually needs much more running time than ours. Based on its original paper, Auto-Augment needs 5000 GPU hours to train Wide-ResNet-40-2 on CIFAR-10 for 120 epochs, while ours is much faster. But, we will add some comparisons between different heuristic augmentation techniques and the proposed methods in the final version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1942/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1942/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WeMix: How to Better Utilize Data Augmentation", "authorids": ["~Yi_Xu8", "asaf.noy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Ming_Lin4", "~Qi_Qian1", "~Li_Hao1", "~Rong_Jin1"], "authors": ["Yi Xu", "Asaf Noy", "Ming Lin", "Qi Qian", "Li Hao", "Rong Jin"], "keywords": ["Data Augmentation", "Data Bias", "Non-convex Optimization", "Deep Learning Theory"], "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely used training trick in deep learning to improve the network generalization ability.

For label-preserving augmentation we used \"contrast\", while for label-mixing augmentation we used \"mixup\".  Since the main contribution of this paper is to explain how to better utilize data augmentation from a theoretical point of view, the main purpose of experimental evaluation is to verify the theoretical findings.  However, we expect to include more experiments in the final version.  \n\n\nQ2. why \"AugDrop\" and \"MixLoss\" can correct the data bias?\n\nAs we shown in the paper, AugDrop can correct the data bias by solving a constrained optimization problem so that it will enjoy small condition number to correct the data bias in the convergence analysis.

The algorithmic approaches and analyses are interesting, but (A) the theoretical results don't deliver a lot of specific actionable insight beyond the high level intuition they start with, and (B) the experimental section is somewhat weak.\n\nIn the main analysis (Sec. 4), the authors establish a bound (Lemma 1) on the generalization error due to training on augmented data (nit: unclear why $w_{t+1}$ is used to denote the final (?) params learned...?) and compare with a standard bound training on normal data.  However, the bound in Lemma 1 is not overly helpful (quadratic dependence on max augmented label divergence- unclear how this helps / is actionable), and the comparison with the normal bound doesn't reveal much but the original intuition that this approach *could* easily introduce bias, as we started with.\n\nThe paper then proposes two algorithms- \"AugDrop\", which uses a constrained optimization approach, and a corresponding theoretical analysis that shows potentially less biased and better performance than training on normal augmented data- and \"MixLoss\".  They also propose combining the two into \"WeMix\".\n\nAt this point, the main issue is with the experiments.  The authors could potentially have tried to fulfill two main objectives here: (A) make this mostly a theory paper, and seek to explore the quantities and tradeoffs of interest in the theoretical analysis in some experiments; and/or (B) show the practical efficacy of the proposed algorithms by running them with real data augmentation approaches, compared against modern approaches.  However, the experiments section accomplishes neither.\n- Re (A): There is no detailed experimental analysis beyond comparing end performance of models trained with the proposed approaches.\n- Re (B): The authors only use very rudimentary data augmentation techniques- mixup and contrast- and only compare to simple and internal baselines, even though there is a rich literature of recent data augmentation approaches that perform much better (e.g. even on the leaderboards recently: https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-100).\n- Again to be clear: this reviewer is *not* saying that all papers need to compare with SOTA.  But if the goal is not to show strong real world performance / applicability as in (B), then the experiments section should at least accomplish something about elucidating core theoretical tradeoffs, insights, etc. as in (A).", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1942/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1942/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WeMix: How to Better Utilize Data Augmentation", "authorids": ["~Yi_Xu8", "asaf.noy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Ming_Lin4", "~Qi_Qian1", "~Li_Hao1", "~Rong_Jin1"], "authors": ["Yi Xu", "Asaf Noy", "Ming Lin", "Qi Qian", "Li Hao", "Rong Jin"], "keywords": ["Data Augmentation", "Data Bias", "Non-convex Optimization", "Deep Learning Theory"], "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely used training trick in deep learning to improve the network generalization ability.

The authors proposes theoretical foundation behind their two methods, AugDrop and MixLoss and show their effectiveness on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 datasets. Although the paper has technical novelty and it only provides incremental gains on relatively small-size dataset. Below, you can find some of my comments/questions about the paper.\n\n1. The paper has some typos and grammar mistakes. Some of them are \"By contrast, we do not need original data is unlimited.\", \"it is sufficiently to optimize Lc(w)\"\n\n2. I feel like the notations used in the introduction is repeated in the beginning of the section 3. There is no need to repeat the same explanations and notations in section 3.\n\n3. I am not sure about the definition of data bias mentioned in the paper. The bias is defined as the difference between the label of the augmented instance and original instance. In reality, there might be strong bias in the label-preserving augmentations, i.e. Jigsaw. I would like to get a clarification on this.\n\n4. The paper only shows experiments only on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Potential positive results on ImageNet would have made the paper much convincing and stronger. This is because, in the past, many augmentation methods, i.e. CutOut, has been shown to perform well on CIFAR10/100 but not on ImageNet.\n\n5. The improvements on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 are very marginal. There exists better data augmentation techniques, i.e. auto-augment, yielding better results on CIFAR10/100. It would be nice to include the results from different augmentation techniques into the experiments sections.\n\n6. Similar to my point at 3, do the authors think that their method would work on an another augmentation method, i.e. jigsaw, that preserves the label? Or is it only constrained for the ones that changes the label.\n\n7. What are the disadvantages of the proposed methods? What kind of complexity do they add, i.e. increased training complexity?\n\n8. I understand that the authors try to show that in the case of very strong augmentations (mixup with 10 images), they can improve the baseline mixup augmentation. However, their performance on the mixup with 10 images is worse than the mixup with 3 images.

If I understand it correctly, the realisation of \"AugDrop\" is to omit data augmentation and train the model on original data, and the realisation of \"MixLoss\" is to train the model on both augmented and original data. The combined method, namely, \"WeMix\" is to run \"MixLoss\" first and then run \"AugDrop\". Overall, this paper is hard for me to follow. Yet another concern is that, the method was tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with \"mixup\" as the only competitor.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n\n1. The paper tried to answer an important question \"when will the deep models benefit from data augmentation?\" They proved (though I didn't check the proof) that \"a deep model can benefit from augmented data when the data bias is small\". Based on this, they developed two methods \"AugDrop\" and \"MixLoss\".\n\n2. The proposed method seems to be very easy to implement.\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\n\n1. I'm not convinced by the current experiments: (i) it runs on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 only (ii) the only competitor is \"mix-up\".\n\n2. It wasn't quite clear (at least for me) why \"AugDrop\" and \"MixLoss\" can correct the data bias. Actually I have been lost at how the authors quantify the data bias.\n\n##########################################################################", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1942/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1942/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "WeMix: How to Better Utilize Data Augmentation", "authorids": ["~Yi_Xu8", "asaf.noy@alibaba-inc.com", "~Ming_Lin4", "~Qi_Qian1", "~Li_Hao1", "~Rong_Jin1"], "authors": ["Yi Xu", "Asaf Noy", "Ming Lin", "Qi Qian", "Li Hao", "Rong Jin"], "keywords": ["Data Augmentation", "Data Bias", "Non-convex Optimization", "Deep Learning Theory"], "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely used training trick in deep learning to improve the network generalization ability. Despite many encouraging results, several recent studies did point out limitations of the conventional data augmentation scheme in certain scenarios, calling for a better theoretical understanding of data augmentation. In this work, we develop a comprehensive analysis that reveals pros and cons of data augmentation. The main limitation of data augmentation arises from the data bias, i.e. the augmented data distribution can be quite different from the original one. This data bias leads to a suboptimal performance of existing data augmentation methods. To this end, we develop two novel algorithms, termed \"AugDrop\" and \"MixLoss\", to correct the data bias in the data augmentation. Our theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms are guaranteed to improve the effect of data augmentation through the bias correction, which is further validated by our empirical studies. Finally, we propose a generic algorithm \"WeMix\" by combining AugDrop and MixLoss, whose effectiveness is observed from extensive empirical evaluations.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "xu|wemix_how_to_better_utilize_data_augmentation", "one-sentence_summary": "This paper theoretically and empirically studies how to better utilize data augmentation by correcting data bias.", "pdf": "/pdf/8de217fd0a05d9a273022ddaaafeda3d22a50ba2.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=LfFkAFttU1", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nxu2021wemix,\ntitle={WeMix: How to Better Utilize Data Augmentation},\nauthor={Yi Xu and Asaf Noy and Ming Lin and Qi Qian and Li Hao and Rong Jin},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=p84tly8c4zf}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
