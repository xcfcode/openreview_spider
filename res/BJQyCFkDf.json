The paper discusses a specific case of 'percolation tasks' they defined, but the structural regularization/priors would be one of important auxiliary information in many real-world contexts including life sciences. Moreover, regularization terms of ML in the optimization formulation often corresponds to the priors in theBayesian settings, and thus the topic investigates a quite promising theme.\n\n\nBut the following points in the manuscript are still unclear and confusing. I understand we have the 3-page limitation, but it would be nice to improve these points.\n\n\n1. Definition of the 'percolation task'. (for example, Figure 2)\n\nHow did you generate the training data for Figure 2? \nGenerate 1000 grid graphs based on 4x4 graph with random edge removals with some fixed probability, add two types of noisy nodes to perturb, and predict the sources-sinks reachability only from a given graph? \n\nThe minimum explanations on these unclearness would be nice to have. The word 'percolation' in the Broadbent-Hammersley's sense reminds us the setting includes some probabilities (open or closed bond with probability p), but the current description of the 'percolation task' would be ambiguous.\n\nIn addition, the reachability check is one of simple examples where, for example, Gated Graph Neural Networks (Li+ ICLR2016) can be solved (It was actually explained at Section 3 in the paper). But GGNN usually requires the edge types, and I wonder if there is any relationship between this 'reachability check' and 'parcorlation task'.... Note that I'm talking about GGNN, not GG 'Sequence' NN which can output sequences, and the main target of the paper above.\n\n\n2. Prediction related to gene interactions (what is x and y of this supervised learning?)\n\nThe \"graph Laplacian regularizers\", as applied to logistic regression in Min+ 2016, is now widely used in many other contexts. But in these situations (including Min+, 2016), the target problem is a 'supervised learning', and we have the response y to be predicted, and some x as observable features, in addition to the graph-structure constraints on x such as gene-gene interactions or protein-protein interactions. \n\nSo, what is y and x in this 'percolation task' setting? x is a 0-1 value on each node (what do 0 and 1 mean?) and y is the source-sink reachability...? What insights can we have for gene-gene interactions if this can be solved in a supervised manner?\n\n\n3. What are predicted from gene expression profiles?\n\nGene expression profiles would usually be real-valued, and gene-gene networks are not grid-like. But, the targeted 'parcolation task', are variables x binary, and what does 'Percolate-Equiv' (based on 6x6 graphs?) means? How to reduce 'Min+, 2016' dataset for Table 1 into binary problems? Is it different from the original prediction problem of their paper..?? This point was very confusing to me.\n\n\nThe list of pros and cons\n\n[pros]\n1. The target topic is very interesting\n2. Some experimental evidences are provided to get some insights\n3. It can be applied to real-world problems of life sciences\n\n[cons]\n1. The problem definition is quite ambiguous to understand the results\n2. The relationship to their 'percolation task' and Min+ 2016's original problem is seemingly unclear\n3. It is not clear whether the main focus is a general interest or a specific interest to prediction based on gene-gene interactions. \n\n\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Priors for Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this work we explore how gene-gene interaction graphs can be used as a prior for the representation of a model to construct features based on known interactions between genes.

We create variants of the percolate task to explore where existing methods fail. We test the limits of existing methods in order to determine what can be improved when applying these methods to a real task. This leads us to propose new methods based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) that use pooling and dropout to deal with noise in the graph prior.", "paperhash": "dutil|graph_priors_for_deep_neural_networks", "keywords": ["Graph Convolutions", "Computational Biology", "Gene Expression"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  dutil2018graph,\n  title={Graph Priors for Deep Neural Networks},\n  author={Francis Dutil and Joseph Paul Cohen and Martin Weiss and Georgy Derevyanko and Yoshua Bengio},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJQyCFkDf}\n}", "authorids": ["dutilf@iro.umontreal.ca", "cohenjos@iro.umontreal.ca", "weissmar@iro.umontreal.ca", "georgy.derevyanko@gmail.com", "bengioy@iro.umontreal.ca"], "authors": ["Francis Dutil", "Joseph Paul Cohen", "Martin Weiss", "Georgy Derevyanko", "Yoshua Bengio"], "TL;DR": "Methods to prior a deep models using information contained in graphs.", "pdf": "/pdf/d892fa2b522f089e631d7fccaf377a98039ce0d7.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1518629844880, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Acceptance_Decision", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Submission", "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs", "everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "value": "ICLR 2018 Workshop Acceptance Decision"}, "comment": {"required": false, "order": 3, "description": "(optional) Comment on this decision.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{0,5000}"}, "decision": {"required": true, "order": 2, "value-dropdown": ["Accept", "Reject"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "cdate": 1518629844880}}}], "count": 5}
