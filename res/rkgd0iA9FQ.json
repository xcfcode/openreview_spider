", "comment": "Thanks for your detailed review. \nIn this note let me try to quickly clarify the notation issues that you have raised. \n\n1. \nIn Definition 1(page 3) \"g\" is a typo! Apologies for this! We have now fixed this typo. \nIt should be a \"f\" in terms of which the L-smoothness' defining inequality has been given there. \n\n2.\nIn Definition 2(page 3) \"Support(v)\" denotes the set of indices of the d-dimensional vector v where the corresponding coordinate of v is non-zero. (...indeed here we are defining the matrix V^(-1/2) using a Penrose inverse and this is somewhat different from say the notation in the ICLR 2018 paper that you mention (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQu7f-RZ)  because we wanted to have an unifying notation between not just RMSProp and ADAM but also for our Theorem 3.3 where there is no \\xi parameter...)\n\n3.\nThere is no conceptual difference between the \"diag\" in Definition 2 (page 3) and the bold-faced diag that one sees in the paragraph headings on page 18 - this bold-facing in the later instance comes from LaTeX's default settings about how it prints headings in the  \\paragraph{} environment. \n\n4.\nThe \\nabla f(x) which occurs in our Algorithm 1 and 2 pseudocodes (on page 3) is not to be understood as necessarily being a full gradient. It is a notational stand-in for whatever the first-order oracle returns and this oracle could be noisy as we specify in the \"Input\" lines of these two algorithms. \n\nIn the first paragraph (page 1) when we give an informal description of NAG our use the notation \\nabla \\tilde{f}_{i_t}  (distinct from the pseudocodes) is adapted to the specific model of stochasticity that we use in that paragraph which is specified as choosing \\tilde{f}_{i_t} randomly from the set of functions {f_1,..,f_k} over which the empirical risk is taking the average. \n\n5.\nBoth in RMSProp as well as ADAM our notation \"g_t^2\" refers to a vector whose i-th coordinate is the square of the i-th coordinate of the vector g_t i.e if g_t \\in R^d then for all i in {1,..,d}, ((g_t)^2)_i = ((g_t)_i)^2  \n\nThanks for pointing out the references.  We have now incorporated these references into a revised upload. Also we noticed that both these references (arXiv:1808.02941 and arXiv:1808.05671) came out after the first version of our work became public and infact both of them cite us. \n\nKindly also see the new VGG-9 with CIFAR-10 experiments in Appendix E (page 29) that we have now added based on suggestions from the Reviewer 1. Hopefully we have now convinced you of the correctness of our results and why they are very interesting.

Taking your suggestion we have added in Appendix E (page 29) a mini-batch image classification experiment on CIFAR-10 (using VGG-9) and have shown that the basic conclusion we had on MNIST continues to hold: that ADAM has lower test-errors as beta-1 is properly tuned (and in our experiments, as it gets close to 1) and at that point it is among the best performers (in terms of test-loss) when compared to RMSProp and NAG. \n\nAlso thanks a lot for bringing this paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08114.pdf) to our attention! We didnt know of this and its indeed a very beautiful paper on a related topic which seems to have appeared a couple of months before our work was completed.  We agree that they get the claim to be the first analysis for adaptive gradient methods on non-convex functions and we have now put in a citation for their paper. (Also on the point of similarities, as in Li-Orabona proofs we too do not need projection steps to get convergence.) But we would like to explain that the relative advantages of our results are quite significant. \n\nThe algorithms they are analyzing are *not* the realistic RMSProp or ADAM which is what we consider. Unlike Li-Orabona, we demonstrate extensive experimental evidence in our paper to motivate the superiority on neural nets of the particular form of adaptivity that we write proofs about  - which infact is much more involved than the modification of AdaGrad that they consider. \n\nMost importantly Li-Orabona's analysis is not for \"``fully\" adaptive algorithms for a very specific reason as we explain in the first point below in the following list of 3 specific reasons as to why we are doing better than them.\n\n1.\nTheir non-asymptotic non-convex proof in Theorem 4 (page 7) can be seen as the closest analogue to our stochastic RMSProp proof. But they use a somewhat artificial form of AdaGrad as specified in their equation 3 (top of page 4).\nThis particular choice of step-length (used in all but one of their proofs) essentially means that their adaptivity is uniform across all coordinates of the gradient! Hence they are removing a very important feature of adaptive algorithms that these algorithms scale different coordinates of the gradient by varying amounts! (empirically this feature is known to be extremely critical!)\n\nIn contrast in our analysis we allow the pre-conditioner to act on the entire gradient vector and thus each coordinate of the gradient gets its own non-trivial scaling. \n\nAlso Li-Orabona prevent the t-th preconditioner from depending on the t-th gradient.  From experiments on RMSProp we know that this modification can significantly hurt performance. We do not do such modifications! \n\n\n\n2.\nAlso their Theorem 4 (page 3) uses an epsilon > 0 setting (their epsilon is defined in their step-size definitions of equations 3 and 4 at the top of page 4). Now not only this means that theirs is not the \"true\" AdaGrad but to the best of our understanding , this also means that their convergence rate in Theorem 4 is *slower* than the standard rates that we can get for stochastic RMSProp (wth some assumptions on the training set) - which is a more complex algorithm!\n\n\n3.\nYou said \"Concretely they show that in the noiseless setting adaptive methods give a faster rate of $O(1/T)$ compared to the standard rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ of SGD\" But apologies that we cannot locate any specific theorem in Li-Orabona which shows such a thing. \n\nThe closest they come to such a result is their statement at the top of their page 6 where they say that under the assumption of their parameter sigma = 0 their convex stochastic adaptive proof is O(1/T) convergence as opposed to convex SGD's O(1/sqrt{T}) Kindly let us know if this is the statement in their paper that you had in mind. \n\nBut this argument on the top of their page 6 is not convincing to us because when sigma =0 their hypothesis (H4') in Page 3 becomes undefined! And Assumption H4' is necessary for their Theorem 1 (bottom of Page 4). And maybe more importantly for *any* sigma > 0, however small, their upperbound in Theorem 1 will eventually be dominated by the second term in the max which is scaling upwards with T as T^{1/2 + epsilon}. Hence to the best of our understanding,  their convergence rates are guaranteed to be *slower* than O(1/sqrt{T}).  \n\nWe hope we have convinced you as to why our results are significantly better than those in the Li-Orabona paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper906/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper906/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper906/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and ADAM in Non-Convex Optimization and an Empirical Comparison to Nesterov Acceleration", "abstract": "RMSProp and ADAM continue to be extremely popular algorithms for training neural nets but their theoretical convergence properties have remained unclear.

We critically use your paper in motivating our setup. We hadnt seen your second paper when we completed our work. \n\nAs Reviewer1 pointed out to us it seems that there has been this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08114) a couple of months before our work was done and hence they rightfully get the credit for being the first proofs of convergence of adapative gradient methods in non-convex settings. But as we have explained in our response to Reviewer 1 below, that there are a number of reasons why we feel ours is a more natural setup and our results are much more substantial than the Li-Orabona paper. \n\nYour paper was definitely a few months before even the Li-Orabona paper but I think sign-based updates which are doing gradient compression should be thought of as a different category than gradient based updates. To our mind, these are conceptually different things. \n\nOfcourse there seems to be some underlying connection between the sign pattern of the gradients and convergence of stochastic adaptive methods as evidenced by the kind of assumptions we need to prove that stochastic RMSProp gets to criticality at standard speeds. To the best of our knowledge ours is the first theorem of its kind which gives some non-trivial sufficient conditions for stochastic RMSProp to get to criticality of non-convex functions. This is definitely a direction to look further into and understand this better. We look forward to more exchange of ideas between the two approaches!

In particular it was shown that the above adaptive gradient algorithms are guaranteed to reach critical points for smooth non-convex objectives and bounds on the running time are provided. An empirical investigation is also presented with main focus on the comparison of the adaptive gradient methods and the Nesterov accelerated gradient algorithm (NAG).  \n\nComments:\nAlthough the results are promising, I found the reading (mainly because of the not defined notation) of this paper really hard. \nIn terms of presentation, the motivation in introduction is fine, but the following section named \"Notations and Pseudocodes\" is confusing and has many undefined notations which makes the paper very hard to read. It gives the impression that the section was added the last minute. For example what is fundtion \"g\" in the definition 1? What is support(v) and the diag(v) in the definition 2. the diag(v) is more obvious to me but then why at page 18 the diag(v)at the top of the page is bold (are these two things different)?\nIn the presentation of RMSProp what the $g_t^2$ means? Please have a look to last year's ICLR paper [Reddi, Sashank J., Satyen Kale, and Sanjiv Kumar. \"On the convergence of adam and beyond.\" (2018).] for a more appropriate introduction of the notation.\n\nIn the introduction the authors refer to NAG as a stochastic variant of the Nesterov's acceleration and they informally present the algorithm in the end of the first paragraph. There the update rule includes stochastic gradients \\nable f_i(.) while in the formal presentation in the update rule there is \\nabla f(x) which is the full gradient of the objective function of the original problem. I expect this difference is somehow justified from the mentioning in the algorithm of the possibly noisy oracle but this is never mention in the main text.\n\nIf the above statements in terms of presentation, are ignored the convergence results and numerical experiments are interesting. \nHowever, the numerical evaluation does not correspond to the theoretical results. It is a comparison of NAG ,ADAM and RMSPROP with interesting conclusions  that can be beneficial for practitioners that they use these methods.\n\nSome missing references:\nOn Adam methods:\n1) Chen, Xiangyi, et al. \"On the convergence of a class of adam-type algorithms for non-convex optimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.02941 (2018).\n2) Zhou, Dongruo, et al. \"On the convergence of adaptive gradient methods for nonconvex optimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.05671 (2018).\nOn momentum (heavy ball) methods:\n3) Loizou, Nicolas, and Peter Richt\u00e1rik. \"Momentum and stochastic momentum for stochastic gradient, Newton, proximal point and subspace descent methods.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.09677 (2017).", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper906/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and ADAM in Non-Convex Optimization and an Empirical Comparison to Nesterov Acceleration", "abstract": "RMSProp and ADAM continue to be extremely popular algorithms for training neural nets but their theoretical convergence properties have remained unclear.
