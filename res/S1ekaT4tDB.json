While most existing work attribute this phenomenon to image structures, this paper suggests that it might be a property of convolution. In particular, it shows Fourier basis are eigenfunctions of convolution, and band pass filters are eigenfunctions for the generalized eigen problem of convolution given a windowed weighting function, which corresponds to a windowed Fourier transform. \n\nThe mathematical observations are interesting, and the paper hypothesizes that this mathematical property encourages neural networks to learn oriented bandpass filters. However, it is unclear why the neural network should learn eigenfunctions as the filters. I understand the paper is proposing a hypothesis, but drawing a more solid conclusion is important. I am not recommending acceptance of this paper in the main conference, but it may be a good paper in a certain workshop.\n\nBesides, does higher layer of a deep neural network also learn bandpass filters w.r.t. its input feature map? How well the phenomenon and the hypothesis could generalize to the deeper layers?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper802/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper802/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Why Convolutional Networks Learn Oriented Bandpass Filters: A Hypothesis", "authors": ["Richard P.

A standard explanation\nof this result is that these filters reflect the structure of the images that they have\nbeen exposed to during training: Natural images typically are locally composed\nof oriented contours at various scales and oriented bandpass filters are matched\nto such structure. The present paper offers an alternative explanation based not\non the structure of images, but rather on the structure of convolutional architectures.\nIn particular, complex exponentials are the eigenfunctions of convolution.\nThese eigenfunctions are defined globally; however, convolutional architectures\noperate locally. To enforce locality, one can apply a windowing function to the\neigenfunctions, which leads to oriented bandpass filters as the natural operators\nto be learned with convolutional architectures.
