Unfortunately so, given the stringent 3 page limit, it was impossible to fit in any more detail, and hopefully our responses are adequately able to address your questions. \n \n1. Since Feed-Forward Neural Networks compute a linear combination of their inputs (W1*x1 + W2*x2) followed by a nonlinearity, they cannot directly model multiplicative interactions. As an alternative, we chose to model multiplication as repeated addition, but we do agree that we could alternatively create an arbitrary computational graph with multiplication as a gate (with errors flowing back as a gradient switch) for this task.\n\n2. Normal equation is an analytical procedure used to obtain optimal parameters for a linear problem. If we define Y = W.X, we can find the optimal weight W by (X^-1)*Y. We used the pseudoinverse and found the parameter W. Here X contains our input samples (Each sample having the 2 operands) and Y is the expected result. Following Neural Programmer [1], we perform all 3 operations (Addition, subtraction and multiplication) and take the weighted sum based on the confidence predicted by the neural network where R is the vector with the result of all three operations and C is confidence vector. Taking a distribution over the three results allows the AU to learn which operation needs to be performed, and predict the confidence scores accordingly.\n\n3. The arithmetic unit also predicts a stopping value at each timestep. We stop when this value is 0. In this use case, we were able to model multiplication as repeated addition, as ARM does not support floating point numbers. However this would still work as long as the multiplier (Number of time steps) is a whole number. The AU itself was a feed-forward Neural Network, trained using the normal equations as described in 2. However, we could alternatively keep \"add\", \"sub\" and \"mul\" as primitive  operations, as is done in Neural Programmer [1]. \n\n4. Similar to ARM, we have one register which acts as the PC. The controller reads the value of this register at each timestep and the corresponding instruction. It uses that as the encoding and updates the PC after every instruction. The reading and writing to PC happens exactly like the other registers as described in Neural Turing Machine [2].\n\n5. Our Controller is a One-Many LSTM. It uses the encoding to generate the list of steps to execute. The controller outputs 2 distributions at every time-step. One over all the smaller operations to perform and another over the operands. We trained the controller using Back-Propagation with the stack-trace generated for every instruction. The training is similar to the procedure followed by the Neural Program Interpreter [3]. We also introduced random noise in the gradient to make the training procedure more robust [4].\n\nWe are glad that you appreciated our idea and our work, and are mindful of the improvements that need to be made. Being an active area of research, we are taking steps in this direction. Some improvements that we have made over the months include using our system to execute recursive algorithms such as finding the factorial of the number, using our memory as a stack, with one of the registers acting as the stack pointer, and deploying the same architecture to generalize beyond ARM to MIPS as well (another RISC architecture.) Since Workshop papers favor late breaking developments and works in progress, we sought to develop on this nascent field of research by getting invaluable feedback through reviews, such as the one you have given, alongside fruitful discussions at the workshop. Unfortunately, due to lack of space we were unable to have an extensive results section within the paper, but we have made the full stack trace as well as the values of the registers and relevant memory locations at each timestep available on our GitHub website https://neu0.github.io\n\n\n[1] Le, Q.V., Neelakantan, A., & Sutskever, I.

That could work for integer values, but how does that work for float values? And how do you define it in a way that it is differentiable? Or is the arithmetic unit not differentiable w.r.t. its inputs?\n- The question about differentiability should also be answered for all the other variables / intermediate values.\n- The PC, I guess that is the address of the ARM code? I guess your branch instructions are conditional jumps, which will conditionally set the PC? How do you do that? Esp., how can that be differentiable? Or is it not differentiable?
