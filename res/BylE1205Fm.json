MUNIT and DRIT both have a content encoder, which is shared or domain-invariant, and a style encoder, that is domain specific. Below, we try to replace the architecture of the style encoder with that of the content encoder, but  still call these content and style, in order to be consistent with the other comments in the discussion.\n\nIn our previous comment, we discussed the issue that arises in MUNIT and DRIT when the style encoder is identical to the content encoder. With two identical encoders, disentanglement of the latent space features into domain specific and domain invariant features is not possible.\n\nFollowing the last comments, we performed the actual experiment: we run MUNIT, when the style encoder, is replaced with an identical copy of the content encoder. In principle, this could give MUNIT the capacity to encode, as the domain specific representation, not only style information, but also content information. As we predicted, the shared encoder becomes muted and only the specific encoder is used in the translation: in inference time, when an input image in domain A is given to the shared (previously content) encoder, and a guide image b from domain B is given to the domain-specific (previously style) encoder, the translation results in the guide image b being returned as output, since the output is simply determined by the second encoder. This can be seen in https://imgur.com/a/vIYVwLa . This makes sense, since such an outcome satisfies all MUNIT losses, and is the \u201ceasiest\u201d way for the network to do so. \n\nIn MUNIT and DRIT, asymmetry between the encoders is introduced by constraining the architecture of the style (or specific) encoder, such that only part of the information of the guide image can be encoded with it. Specifically, the latent space dimension of the style encoder is 8 in both MUNIT and DRIT, while for the content encoder it is 256x64x64 for MUNIT and 512x8x8 for DRIT. In MUNIT additional architectural choices such as using AdaIN (adaptive instance normalization) layers and the removal of IN layers, which remove the mean and variance, are made to further enforce style changes (see the MUNIT paper, Sec. 5.1, and the DRIT paper, Sec. 4, for more details).\n\nIn the approach we introduce, symmetry breaking between the two encoders is done differently. We consider translations where the first domain is a subset of the second domain information-wise, but do not constrain the architecture of the domain-B-specific encoder. To do so, Eq. 7 (the reconstruction loss in domain A) enforces that we can recover samples from domain A where the unshared part of the latent code is set to 0, that is, it contains no information. This is reasonable, since information-wise A is a subset of B, and so the common encoder captures all of the information encoded by a sample in A. Using Eq. 9 (discrimination between the encodings of the two domains) enforces that no domain-B-specific information is encoded in the shared encoder e1, and Eq. 8 (reconstruction loss in domain B) enforces that the remaining information is encoded in the domain-B-specific encoder e2. These constraints are sufficient to introduce asymmetry without constraining the architecture of the domain specific encoder.\n\nTo demonstrate what happens to our solution when we replace e2 with a style type encoder, we have changed e2 to the MUNIT style encoder. The results can be seen in the following URL:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DMpcn4N \n (top row : input image, left column: guide image)\n\nThe results show that due to our constraints, there is still an addition of the missing information (glasses in this case). However, since e2 in this experiment can only capture content in a limited way, the added glasses are accompanied with a change of style, and with added blurriness. This demonstrates that our method of breaking the symmetry has the advantage of not limiting the architecture of the second encoder.\n\nAs an additional ablation, we ran the same experiment (using a style architecture for e2)  without zeroing out the output of e2 on images from domain A when computing the losses, i.e., replace 0_{E2} in Eq. 7 by e2(a). In this experiment, our method becomes much more similar to DRIT and MUNIT (not transferring glasses), only employing a smaller number of losses. As can be seen in URL below, we obtain a behavior that is similar to that of these methods on the glasses dataset. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/49ff9fx\n (top row : input image, left column: guide image)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Emerging Disentanglement in Auto-Encoder Based Unsupervised Image Content Transfer", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning to map, in an unsupervised way, between domains $A$ and $B$, such that the samples $\\vb \\in B$ contain all the information that exists in samples $\\va\\in A$ and some additional information.

However I do have a few concerns:   \n\n1. The writing can certainly be improved.  I had a difficult time understanding Section 2. For example the function Q is upper cased but later the f and g are all lower cased. Why domains A and B are defined using the space and the probability measure? \"our framework assumes that the distribution of persons with sunglasses and that of persons without them is the same,\" The \"distribution of persons\" is not a rigorous definition and is hard to infer what does it actually mean. \"f\" does not appear in the loss terms although it appears under \"min\". \n\n2. I like the simplicity of the objective function, but it is hard for me to understand that why the algorithm does not pick up spurious differences between A and B.

Below, we address your comments one by one. Please let us know if this does not clarify your concerns.\n\nSpecific task: the task we tackle is widely applicable. However, we tested it on images due to the availability of accessible data. Other examples in which the method can be applied include music datasets, where a musical instrument is added, computer design, where one wishes to add elements to a blueprint, the addition of certain style elements to text, and so on.\n\nThe same argument used by the authors of Fader networks (NIPS, 2017) applies here: \u201cA key advantage of our method compared to many recent models is that it generates realistic images of high resolution without needing to apply a GAN to the decoder output. As a result, it could easily be extended to other domains like speech, or text, where the backpropagation through the decoder can be really challenging because of the non-differentiable text generation process for instance.\u201c\n\nNote that we are at least as general as the Fader networks. While they subtract content or add generic content, we allow the addition of specific ones. In order to demonstrate this, we have added to the revised version an experiment where we employ our method to remove content. \n\nMore specifically, Fader networks cannot employ guidance to add glasses (or other features). Therefore, the task we compare with Fader networks on, is the one of removing glasses. In our case, we use the trained networks and follow a straightforward pipeline: we embed a picture of a person with glasses, zero the part that corresponds to glasses and decode the obtained representation. The revised version contains, in a new part of Sec. 5, qualitative results as well as a quantitative evaluation and a user study.\n\nThis experiment can be seen as a specific instance of \u201csemi-supervised source separation\u201d, which is researched problem by itself [Smaragdis et al, \"Supervised and semi-supervised separation of sounds from single-channel mixtures.\" In Int.  Conf. on ICA and Signal Separation, 2007]. \n\nTo show the applicability to music, we present here an initial result in which the two domains are Jazz music with and without percussion instruments. In the preliminary example below we show how we add the drums, as they appear in one music segment, to a musical segment without drums. This is done in the spectral domain and the quality is therefore limited.\n\nReference source with no percussion: https://instaud.io/2Uk5 \nGuide (jazz music with percussion): https://instaud.io/2UjY \nDrums from the second sample added to the first: https://instaud.io/2Uk7 \n\nReviewer: \nIn several places the paper claims that the proposed approach is considerably simpler. Some parts hint to criteria for the \u2018complexity\u2019 comparison, such as Table 1 or a few sentences (e.g. \u201cthis allows us to train with many less parameters and without the need to applying excessive tuning\u201d). It would be more convincing to have a dedicated discussion of the practical advantages of the simplicity claimed by this method, discussing e.g. training/testing time, memory footprint of the models, convergence properties, stability, etc. \n\nAnswer:\nTab. 1 compares the various methods with respect to the number of networks and the type of representation sharing used. More networks and less sharing leads to a much more complex optimization problem.\n\nFollowing the review, we added Tab. 2 in the revised version, which directly compares the runtime and memory footprint of each method. In addition to the results in the table, we note that we use the same hyperparameters throughout all experiments (code is publically available), which leads us to believe that the simplicity of our method results in added robustness.\n\nReviewer: \nThe chosen baselines, i.e. MUNIT and DRIT are experimentally shown to perform poorly on the considered task. Yet although these methods were also developed for guided image translation, they were designed for a rather different application: style transfer. I am not sure these comparisons bring much insight on the performance of the method.Experiments are conducted for a very specific task, on a single dataset. Would the method have broader application?\n\nAnswer:\nWe compare to MUNIT and DRIT since these are the closest methods in the literature. We have added above experiments comparing aspects of our method with the Fader networks.\n\nReviewer:\nI understand that such an approach is difficult to evaluate quantitatively but I am not sure what there is to learn from experiments reported in Table 3, as there is no point of comparison on this task. This could be clarified. \n\nAnswer: \nThis experiment was added to further complement the user study in the previous table of the original manuscript. Since there is no method that can be used as a point of comparison (Fader networks do not use a guided image), and following the review, the table removed in the revised version. \n\n(continued below)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Emerging Disentanglement in Auto-Encoder Based Unsupervised Image Content Transfer", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning to map, in an unsupervised way, between domains $A$ and $B$, such that the samples $\\vb \\in B$ contain all the information that exists in samples $\\va\\in A$ and some additional information.

The problem is said to be \u2018unsupervised\u2019, i.e. there is no pairwise correspondences between images of the two domains (with/without attributes).\nThe novelty of the approach lies on\n-\tthe loss, which is composed of three terms: two reconstruction losses and a domain confusion loss\n-\tthe overall architecture and in particular the fact that images are represented as a combination of the output of two encoders: one encodes the face and the other encodes the property (e.g. glasses).\n\nOverall comments:\n+ a theoretical part discusses generalization bounds and the emergence of disentangled representations\n+ visual results are appealing showing the suitability of the method to the considered task\n- the discussion of the advantages of the proposed method could be improved\n- the motivation for some of the experimental results is unclear (choice of experimental protocol and baselines). \n- the scope of the method seems limited\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nI personally like the described model. The disentanglement mechanism is intuitive to understand, and seems well suited for this particular task, as qualitative evidence suggests. I am not sure if this approach would be applicable beyond the very specific scenario considered in the paper. \n\nThe paper emphasizes that the strength of the method lies on its simplicity w.r.t. competitors, and its better results. These two aspects could be better discussed. \n\nSimplicity: \nIn several places the paper claims that the proposed approach is considerably simpler. Some parts hint to criteria for the \u2018complexity\u2019 comparison, such as Table 1 or a few sentences (e.g. \u201cthis allows us to train with many less parameters and without the need to applying excessive tuning\u201d). It would be more convincing to have a dedicated discussion of the practical advantages of the simplicity claimed by this method, discussing e.g. training/testing time, memory footprint of the models, convergence properties, stability, etc. \n\nComparison: \nThe chosen baselines, i.e. MUNIT and DRIT are experimentally shown to perform poorly on the considered task. Yet although these methods were also developed for guided image translation, they were designed for a rather different application: style transfer. I am not sure these comparisons bring much insight on the performance of the method.\nExperiments are conducted for a very specific task, on a single dataset. Would the method have broader application?\n\nExperimental protocol:\nI understand that such an approach is difficult to evaluate quantitatively but I am not sure what there is to learn from experiments reported in Table 3, as there is no point of comparison on this task. This could be clarified. \n\nAdditional comments:\n-\tThe paper relies on the assumption that the distribution of persons with sunglasses and that of persons without them is the same, except for the sunglasses. This sounds like a strong requirement for the data used to train the network; it would be interesting to discuss the practical impact of this assumption, especially on the data requirement for the method to perform well\n-\tI found Figure 1 quite useful. A visual representation of the architecture and its associated description help follow the technical part. \n-\tI got confused with some of the claims in section 4.2. More generally, I found the technical part hard to follow.\n-\tThe user study seems small: only 10 pairs of images are considered. How were those pair chosen?

Below, we address the raised concerns one by one. Please let us know if you are not satisfied with our replies.\n\nConcern #1:\n\nWe went to great lengths to adhere to the math style recommended provided this year by the ICLR program chairs and have employed the suggested conventions from math_commands.tex.\n\nReviewer: The function Q is uppercased but later f and g are all lower-cased. \n\nAnswer: We wanted to create a clear distinction between real networks that are learned (f,g) and an unknown underlying representation Q. We would be happy to change this. \n\nReviewer: Why domains A and B are defined using the space and the probability measure? \n\nAnswer: This is the conventional formal approach for defining a domain from which the samples are being selected i.i.d in some sample space. This is the common assumption in machine learning, e.g.,  Vapnik (2000), Bousquet and Alisseeff (2001), and it is required for the theoretical results.\n\nReviewer: \"our framework assumes that the distribution of persons with sunglasses and that of persons without them is the same,\" The \"distribution of persons\" is not a rigorous definition and is hard to infer what does it actually mean.\n\nAnswer: We should have been more careful and discussed \u201cdistribution of images of persons\u201d and not \u201cdistribution of persons.\u201d This sentence is an example given after the rigorous definition. Specifically, we wanted to explain Eq. 2 using our running example.  The entire paragraph reads \u201cNote that within Eq. 2, there is an assumption on the underlying distributions D_A and D_B. Using the concrete example, our framework assumes that the distribution of persons\u201d etc.\n\nReviewer: \"f\" does not appear in the loss terms although it appears under \"min\".\n\nAnswer: f is defined 2 lines above (see Eq. 5) as f(a,b) = (e_1(a),e_2(b)) and the loss terms includes e_1 and e_2.\n\n Concern #2:\n\nReviewer: ...why the algorithm does not pick up spurious differences between A and B. For example, what if there are lighting differences and glasses/no-glasses differences between A and B?  \n\nAnswer: We divide our answer to two parts: common to many methods and specific to our method. It should be noted that while guided mapping occurs for individual images but is based on a preliminary training of unlabeled and unmatched images from the two domains.\n\n(i) Similarly to many other A to B mapping methods in the literature, the algorithm learns what differs between the domains based on the examples of the training set. Given a large enough sample size, the spurious differences are not as consistent as the target difference. In other words, using the concrete example given in the question, differences in lighting appear in both images with glasses and images without, and are therefore encoded in the common part of the representation.\n\n(ii) In our method, this effect is amplified. The representations of A and B are asymmetric and the network, by design, assigns to images in B content that is not present in A. When this content is removed, a loss (Eq. 9) ensures that we obtain images that are indistinguishable from images in A.\n\nConcern #3:\n\nReviewer: Given the huge differences in performance between the proposed method and MUNIT and DRIT, some analysis/discussion on the reason of success/failure should be given.\n\nAnswer: We explicitly mention in the paper: \u201cThe type of guiding that is obtained from the target domain in MUNIT is referred to as style, while in our case, the guidance provides content. Therefore, MUNIT, as can be seen in our experiments, cannot add specific glasses, when shifting from the no-glasses domain to the faces with eyewear domain.\u201d\n\nIn the next version, we will make sure to elaborate on this. The MUNIT and DRIT architectures lead the methods to focus on conditional style, i.e. global changes to the picture, while our method focuses on local changes (content). Therefore when given two images, MUNIT and DRIT look at the reference picture and pick up global \u201cstyle\u201d characteristics, such as background or lighting, while we are able to capture the added content.\n\nMUNIT and DRIT both use two different types of encoders that enforce a separation of the latent space representations to either style or content vectors. For example, the style encoder, unlike the content encoder, employs spatial pooling. It also results in a smaller representation than the content one. This is important, in the context of these methods, in order to ensure that the two representations encode different aspects of the image. If MUNIT/DRIT were to use the same type of encoder twice, then one encoder could capture all the information and the image-based guiding (mixing representations from two images) would become mute.\n\nIn contrast, our method (i) does not separate style and content, and (ii) as mentioned above, has a representation that is geared toward capturing the additional content."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper980/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Emerging Disentanglement in Auto-Encoder Based Unsupervised Image Content Transfer", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning to map, in an unsupervised way, between domains $A$ and $B$, such that the samples $\\vb \\in B$ contain all the information that exists in samples $\\va\\in A$ and some additional information.
