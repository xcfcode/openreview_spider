However, the results reported here are not sufficiently significant for ICLR.\n\nThe authors make a big deal throughout the paper about how close to training data the adversarial examples they can find on the data manifold are. E.g.: \u201cDespite being extremely rare, these misclassifications appear close to randomly sampled points on the sphere.\u201d  They report mean distance to nearest errors on the data manifold is 0.18 whereas mean distance between two random points on inner sphere is 1.41. However, distance between two random points on the sphere is not the right comparison. The mean distance between random nearest neighbors from the training samples would be much more appropriate.\n\nThey also stress in the Conclusions their Conjecture 5.1 that under some assumptions \u201cthe average distance to nearest error may decrease on the order of O(1 / d) as the input dimension grows large.\u201d However, earlier they admitted that \u201cWhether or not a similar conjecture holds for image manifolds is unclear and should be investigated in future work.\u201d So, the practical significance of this conjecture is unclear.  Furthermore, it is well known that in high dimensions, the distances between pairs of training samples tends towards a large constant (e.g. making nearest neighbor search using triangular inequality pruning infeasible), so extreme care much be taken to not over generalize any results from these sorts of synthetic high dimensional experiments.\n\nAuthors note that for higher dimensional spheres, adversarial examples on the manifold (sphere shell) could found, but not smaller d:  \u201cIn our experiments the highest dimension we were able to train the ReLU net without adversarial examples seems to be around d = 60.\u201d  Yet,in their later statement in that same paragraph  \u201cWe did not investigate if larger networks will work for larger d.\u201d, it is unclear what is meant by \u201cwill work\u201d; because, presumably, larger networks (with more weights) would be HARDER to avoid adversarial examples being found on the data manifold, so larger networks should be less likely \u201cto work\u201d, if \u201cwork\u201d means avoid adversarial examples.  In any case, their apparent use of only h=1000 unit networks (for both ReLU and quadratic cases) is disappointing, because it is not clear whether the phenomena observed would be qualitatively similar for different fully-separable discriminants (e.g. different h values with different regularization costs even if all such networks had zero classification errors).\n\nThe authors repeat the following exact same phrase in both the Introduction and the Conclusion:\n\u201cOur results highlight the fact that the epsilon norm ball adversarial examples often studied in defence papers are not the real problem but are rather a tractable research problem. \u201c\nBut it is not clear exactly what the authors meant by this. Also, the term \u201cepsilon norm ball\u201d is not commonly used in adversarial literature, and the only reference to such papers is Madry et al, (2017), which is only on ArXiv and not widely known \u2014 if these types of adversarial examples are \u201coften studied\u201d as claimed, there should be other / more established references to cite here.\n\nIn short, this work addresses the important problem of better understanding adversarial examples, but the simple setup has a higher burden to establish significance, which this paper as written has not met.\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adversarial Spheres", "abstract": "    State of the art computer vision models have been shown to be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations of the input.

This gives an ellipsoid decision boundary around the origin. It is observed that words case and average case empirical error estimates diverge when the input is high dimensional.

We have made significant changes to the abstract, and sections 5 and 6 of the paper. We hope the reviewers can reread these sections as it should answer many of their questions as to what insights and takeaways our experiments give. We also clarify in this rebuttal what this paper achieves, what insights can be gained, and why it is significant. \n\tThe goal of this paper was to understand why machine learning models trained on high dimensional spaces are vulnerable to small perturbations (as in the case of image models). Past work has treated the existence of adversarial examples as a problem due to model architecture, loss function, or training data. We consider instead the possibility that even a small amount of classification error may sometimes logically force the existence of many adversarial examples. We use this synthetic dataset to illustrate and explore this phenomenon. Obtaining a complete picture of the geometry of machine learning decision boundaries in high dimensional spaces is extremely difficult and necessitates simplifying the problem where it can be easily understood. The motivation to study concentric spheres is to isolate the effect of high dimensionality of a data manifold on the nature of adversarial examples in a simple setting that can be analyzed theoretically.\n\tWe have updated the paper with a proof of Conjecture 5.1 (now Theorem 5.1). The theorem follows from the special case we proved in the Appendix and an isoperimetric inequality of [1]. Intuitively, what [1] showed is that the subset E of the sphere of a given measure which maximizes the average distance to E is a \u201cpole\u201d (for example in d=3 a local region near the north pole of area 1% is the region which maximizes the average distance to E). What we calculated in the Appendix is that an error set like the north pole of fixed measure will extend to within O(1/sqrt{d}) of the equator, this calculation combined with the result in [1] implies Theorem 5.1. This gives a theoretically optimal tradeoff between the amount of classification error and the average distance to nearest error, and illustrates the counterintuitive nature of high dimensional spaces.\n\tAmazingly, when we compare several trained neural networks to this optimal bound we see that they naturally are within a small factor of it. This occurs for 3 different architectures, the ReLU and quadratic networks studied in the first version of the paper, and also a large h=2000 depth 8 ReLU network. This behavior can be seen in the updated paper (Figure 5). This answers reviewer 3\u2019s question about larger networks being more vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations. We see that this is not the case at all in Figure 5 - across all 3 architectures, what determines the average distance to nearest error is the accuracy of the network, not the size or complexity of the architecture. Figure 5 demonstrates quantitatively that the model\u2019s decision boundaries are remarkably well behaved, the geometry of the error sets are close to optimal given the amount of test error each network has. Thus the reason random points are \u201cclose\u201d to an error is a fundamental consequence of the high dimensional space, and not the result of some other issue of neural networks.\n\tThis paper raises a lot of questions as to the nature of adversarial examples, in particular what is the difference between an adversarial example and a test error? This paper shows that, at least for this dataset, there is no difference between a test error and local adversarial error. Thus there isn\u2019t something \u201cspecial\u201d to do in order to significantly increase adversarial robustness other than reduce the amount of test error. One type of defense strategy assumes that adversarial examples are off the data manifold, this is what motivated the manifold attack. Several recent submissions to ICLR [2], [3], [4] propose defenses based on this assumption. The manifold attack searches for local errors in the data distribution, and is used to construct all adversarial examples found in this paper. At least in this simple setting we can say confidently that there are local errors both on and off the data manifold, and which ones the attacker finds depends on the attack algorithm.\n\tOf course this is a toy problem, and we should be cautious before arriving at similar conclusions for image datasets. However, we believe this is an important direction to pursue which completely rethinks the nature of adversarial examples. Perhaps local adversarial errors are a naturally occurring phenomenon on high dimensional datasets? We hope that a complete understanding of this very simple case will point the way forward to explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial examples.\n\n[1] Tadeusz Figiel, Joram Lindenstrauss, and Vitali D Milman.
