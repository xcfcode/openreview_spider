Additional auxiliary classifiers are introduced to encourage the separation of domain and class specific latent codes. This framework has also been extended to semi-supervised learning. \n\nPros: The studied problem is interesting, and the model itself is also intuitive. The overall framework looks elegant. \n\nCons:\n(i) There is nothing special that surprises me in the model. It follows standard VAE design and standard extension to semi-supervised learning for VAE. It naturally extends the original VAE to incorporate domain-specific latent code inside. So I feel the whole model design is kind of boring.\n\n(ii) Only experiments on MNIST are considered, so the experiments are relatively less interesting. As also noted by the authors, more interesting experiments on more challenging datasets are desired.
