There is no discussion on the model size in AlignFlow and that required by CycleGAN. \n  * lacking some of the most impressive results from cyclegan.\n\nQuestion for the authors:\n  * in my experience, RNVPs are quite fiddly to train. I expect that when adversarial training is added to the mix, things get even more fiddly. What did you do to stabilize your model?\n  * how sensitive is the model to the choice of 'lambda_a and \\lambda_b?
