Miech et al. improve text-video embedding by training on HowTo100M and show the gain by transferring it to the text to video retrieval task. In comparison, CBT focuses on learning generic visual and temporal features, with or without using text-video correspondences. We show that CBT can be transferred to various downstream tasks, such as classification, anticipation, segmentation and captioning.\n2. Miech et al. assume the visual features to be pre-trained and fixed, while CBT can be applied for self-supervised visual representation learning, as shown in Table 1. \n\nDirect comparison to (Miech2019c):\nWe evaluate our cross-modal model pre-trained on HowTo100M with the same preprocessing as in (Miech2019c), i.e. with short clips. We evaluate on the MSR-VTT clip retrieval benchmark (zero-shot settings) and can observe that we outperform their approach, see below. We will add this results to the final version of the paper if accepted. \nHowTo100M (table 6):    R@1: 7.5   R@5: 21.2   R@10: 29.6   median R: 38\nOurs:                                 R@1: 8.3   R@5: 23.3   R@10: 33.2   median R: 30\n\n\u201cThe inputs are real-valued vectors\u201d:\nThank you for pointing this out, we will clarify in the final version.\n\nInfluence of ASR and punctuation:\nThe video clips and speech released by HowTo100M were preprocessed and broken into short segments. To learn long-term temporal features with the transformer, our approach requires longer input clips. Hence, we re-extract the ASR with the same algorithm as HowTo100M and run punctuation to get longer semantic coherent text segments (sentences). Furthermore, we concatenate several consecutive sentences to obtain even longer sequences of video-ASR training data. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1598/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1598/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["chensun@google.com", "fabien.baradel@insa-lyon.fr", "kpmurphy@google.com", "cordelias@google.com"], "title": "Learning Video Representations using Contrastive Bidirectional Transformer", "authors": ["Chen Sun", "Fabien Baradel", "Kevin Murphy", "Cordelia Schmid"], "pdf": "/pdf/dbb1d3930a9b1c8e935cfaa2e38abe29f3b9541d.pdf", "TL;DR": "Generalized BERT for continuous and cross-modal inputs; state-of-the-art self-supervised video representations.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for video features that results in significantly improved performance on downstream tasks (such as video classification, captioning and segmentation) compared to existing methods.

CBT objective for self-supervised visual representation learning. We study the impact of the CBT objective, which uses long temporal information as self-supervision, in Table 1. We observe that CBT outperforms alternative training objectives based on local spatial (3DRotNet) and temporal (Shuffle&Learn) objectives significantly, when they were pre-trained on the same Kinetics data with the same backbone ConvNet (Table 1 left). Our CBT method also outperforms the state of the art (Table 1 right).\n\n2. CBT and cross-modal objectives for temporal representation learning. In Table 2 (left) and Table 4 (left) we compare our method with VideoBERT, which applies vector quantization on visual features. We found CBT outperforms VideoBERT significantly. In Table 3 (left), we observe that the cross-modal objective further improves the performance on action anticipation tasks.\n\nChoice of datasets:\n\nThe action segmentation accuracy metric, along with the baselines we compare with, were quoted from Table 3 of the COIN dataset paper. We note that their fully-supervised baseline (Tang et al. 2019) performed worse than the weakly-supervised baseline (Ding & Xu 2018). We will make the supervision type clear in the final version.\nBesides the COIN dataset, we do provide ActivityNet evaluations in Table 2&3, along with other benchmarks such as HMDB (Table 1), UCF (Table 1), Breakfast (Table 2&3) and YouCook (Table 4). This range of datasets helps us understand the performance of CBT in diverse visual domains.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1598/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1598/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["chensun@google.com", "fabien.baradel@insa-lyon.fr", "kpmurphy@google.com", "cordelias@google.com"], "title": "Learning Video Representations using Contrastive Bidirectional Transformer", "authors": ["Chen Sun", "Fabien Baradel", "Kevin Murphy", "Cordelia Schmid"], "pdf": "/pdf/dbb1d3930a9b1c8e935cfaa2e38abe29f3b9541d.pdf", "TL;DR": "Generalized BERT for continuous and cross-modal inputs; state-of-the-art self-supervised video representations.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for video features that results in significantly improved performance on downstream tasks (such as video classification, captioning and segmentation) compared to existing methods.

The core idea is to extend previous work on clip-level embeddings (e.g. the max-margin ranking loss proposed for HowTo 100M) to a transformer architecture which takes into account the entire context of a video, which should lead to better learned representations and improved performance in downstream tasks. In addition, the max-margin loss is replaced by noise contrastive estimation. \n\nThe paper is well written and explains the main problem well, however I do have a few questions:\n- I do not understand the sentence \"However, for images and videos, the inputs are real-valued vectors.\" (Section 3.2) - Transformers are being used for speech recognition or speech translation - the input features are not the problem. The outputs are assumed to be discrete (in the original formulation)\n- Why not directly compare your approach to the approach presented in (Miech, 2019c) - it would be interesting to see a direct comparison, but as far as I can tell, there is no overlap in tasks?\n- What is the influence of adding punctuation to the ASR output, how good is it, and how good is the underlying ASR?

NCE alone seems to clearly produce better results over published results, however these are not compared like-to-like, as published results are used for this comparison.\n\nThe paper is full of technical details to reproduce the results.

The main contribution of the paper is a successful effort to incorporate BERT-like models into vision tasks. As is detailed in the related work, the field has been inching towards this but without as much success as this paper has.\n\nMy main criticism of the paper is that it feels like there is everything and a bag of chips happening; It's exceptionally hard to tease apart what is the main contribution to its success. I mostly came away from the paper thinking that it was good to see an existence proof of successfully incorporating the result, but not having really understood anything more wrt why or how this works. Other than it being a good idea to have a bigger model and more varied types of gradients, it's unclear what this model does that distinguishes it from other approaches.\n\nOn a more specific critique level, why use COIN? And why compare on a frame accuracy metric? The comparison to Ding & Xu seems a bit odd given that they don't assume access to annotations but rather to video transcripts. There are other datasets that you could make use of here that are more applicable, like Thumos14 or ActivityNet. I understand that this is a small section, but arguably the paper would be stronger if more time was spent on the main result than on this sidebar.\n\nOverall, I'm giving it a weak accept because I do think that the community should be aware of this paper's result."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1598/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1598/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["chensun@google.com", "fabien.baradel@insa-lyon.fr", "kpmurphy@google.com", "cordelias@google.com"], "title": "Learning Video Representations using Contrastive Bidirectional Transformer", "authors": ["Chen Sun", "Fabien Baradel", "Kevin Murphy", "Cordelia Schmid"], "pdf": "/pdf/dbb1d3930a9b1c8e935cfaa2e38abe29f3b9541d.pdf", "TL;DR": "Generalized BERT for continuous and cross-modal inputs; state-of-the-art self-supervised video representations.", "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach for video features that results in significantly improved performance on downstream tasks (such as video classification, captioning and segmentation) compared to existing methods.
