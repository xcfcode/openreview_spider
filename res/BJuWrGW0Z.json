The proposed models make sense and the writing is for the most part clear, though there are a few places where ambiguity arises:\n\n- The variable \"Evidence\" in equation (4) is never defined. \n\n- The authors refer to \"predicting the error patterns\", but again don't define what an error pattern is. The appendix seems to suggest that the authors are simply performing multilabel classification based on a predefined set of classes of errors, is this correct? \n\n- It is not immediately clear from Figures 3 and 4 that the architectures employed are in fact recurrent.\n\n- Figure 5 seems to suggest that dependencies are only enforced at points in a program where assignment is performed for a variable, is this correct?\n\nAssuming that the authors can address these clarity issues, I would in principle be happy for the paper to appear.

We have given a detailed discussion regarding this point in our response to AnonReviewer2, which we include below for your convenience.\n\nThere are fundamental differences between the syntactic program traces explored in prior work (Reed & De Freitas (2015)) and the \u201csemantic program traces\u201d considered in our work. Consider the example in Figure 1. According to Reed & De Freitas (2015), the two sorting algorithms will have an identical representation with respect to statements that modify the variable A:\n\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\n\nOur representation, on the other hand, can capture their semantic differences in terms of program states by also only considering the variable A: \n\n  Bubble          Insertion\n[5,5,1,4,3]\t[5,5,1,4,3]\n[5,8,1,4,3]\t[5,8,1,4,3]\n[5,1,1,4,3] \t[5,1,1,4,3]\n[5,1,8,4,3] \t[5,1,8,4,3]\n[1,1,8,4,3] \t[5,1,4,4,3]\n[1,5,8,4,3] \t[5,1,4,8,3]\n[1,5,4,4,3]\t[5,1,4,3,3]\n[1,5,4,8,3] \t[5,1,4,3,8]\n[1,4,4,8,3] \t[1,1,4,3,8]\n[1,4,5,8,3] \t[1,5,4,3,8]\n[1,4,5,3,3] \t[1,4,4,3,8]\n[1,4,5,3,8] \t[1,4,5,3,8]\n[1,4,3,3,8] \t[1,4,3,3,8]\n[1,4,3,5,8] \t[1,4,3,5,8]\n[1,3,3,5,8] \t[1,3,3,5,8]\n[1,3,4,5,8] \t[1,3,4,5,8]\n\nThis example also illustrates concretely the point made in Section 1 that minor syntactic differences can lead to signi\ufb01cant semantic differences. Therefore, the approach of Reed & De Freitas is insufficient to capture such semantic differences.  As another example, consider the following two programs:\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n        string str = String.Empty;\n        int x = 0;\n        x++;\n}\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n        string s = \"\";\n        int y = 0;\n        y = y+1;\n}\n\nAccording to the representation proposed in Reed & De Freitas (2015), the first program is represented as [string str = String.Empty, int x = 0, x++], while the second represented as [string s = \"\", int y = 0, y = y+1].  Although the two programs share the same semantics, they are represented differently due to syntactic variations. In contrast, our work captures the same semantic trace for both programs, i.e., [ [\u201c\u201d, NA], [\u201c\u201d,0], [\u201c\u201d,1]].\n\nTo sum up, the embedding proposed in Reed & De Freitas (2015) is a syntactic representation, and cannot precisely capture a program\u2019s semantics and abstract away its syntactic redundancies. Consequently, the encoder will not be able to learn the true feature dimensions in the embeddings.  We also performed additional experiments to contrast the two trace-based approaches. We used the same configuration of encoder (cf. Section 5) to embed the syntactic traces on the same datasets for the same classification problem. The results are as follows:\n\nProblems                        Reed & De Freitas (2015)          Token                 AST            Dependency Model\nPrint Chessboard                   26.3%                                   16.8%                16.2%                    99.3%\nCount Parentheses                25.5%                                   19.3%                21.7%\t                 98.8%\nGenerate Binary Digits         23.8%                                    21.2%                20.9%\t                 99.2%\n\nAlthough syntactic traces result in better accuracy than Token and AST, they are still significantly worse than semantic embeddings introduced in our work. \n\nOur revision will include the representation proposed in Reed & De Freitas (2015) for the example programs in Figure 1. It will also include the experimental setup (in Section 5) and the new results (in a new column of Table 3).\n\nWe will also add a citation to Cai et al. (2017), which uses the exact same program representation as Reed & De Freitas (2015). The other contributions in Cai et al. (2017) are unrelated to our work. \n\nWe hope that our response helped address your concerns. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

We clarify below the four specific points raised. \n\n1. By \u201cerror patterns\u201d, we mean different types of errors that students made in their programming submissions. This work focuses on providing quality feedback to students.  It may be extended in future work to help software developers, where error patterns can correspond to different classes of errors that developers may make. However, it is not the consideration for the current version of the paper.\n\n2. We will clarify all abbreviations and terms used in the paper. \n\nYes, GRU is Gated Recurrent Unit.\n\n3. The results of our latest experiments clearly indicate that this work substantially improves prior work. We briefly highlight the main reasons below.  First, there are fundamental differences between the syntactic program traces explored in prior work (Reed & De Freitas (2015)) and the \u201csemantic program traces\u201d considered in our work. Consider the example in Figure 1. According to Reed & De Freitas (2015), the two sorting algorithms will have an identical representation with respect to statements that modify the variable A:\n\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\nA[j] = A[j + 1]\t\t\nA[j + 1] = tmp\t\t\n\nOur representation, on the other hand, can capture their semantic differences in terms of program states by also only considering the variable A: \n\n Bubble           Insertion\n[5,5,1,4,3]\t[5,5,1,4,3]\n[5,8,1,4,3]\t[5,8,1,4,3]\n[5,1,1,4,3] \t[5,1,1,4,3]\n[5,1,8,4,3] \t[5,1,8,4,3]\n[1,1,8,4,3] \t[5,1,4,4,3]\n[1,5,8,4,3] \t[5,1,4,8,3]\n[1,5,4,4,3]\t[5,1,4,3,3]\n[1,5,4,8,3] \t[5,1,4,3,8]\n[1,4,4,8,3] \t[1,1,4,3,8]\n[1,4,5,8,3] \t[1,5,4,3,8]\n[1,4,5,3,3] \t[1,4,4,3,8]\n[1,4,5,3,8] \t[1,4,5,3,8]\n[1,4,3,3,8] \t[1,4,3,3,8]\n[1,4,3,5,8] \t[1,4,3,5,8]\n[1,3,3,5,8] \t[1,3,3,5,8]\n[1,3,4,5,8] \t[1,3,4,5,8]\n\nThis example also illustrates concretely the point made in Section 1 that minor syntactic differences can lead to signi\ufb01cant semantic differences. Therefore, the approach of Reed & De Freitas is insufficient to capture such semantic differences.  As another example, consider the following two programs:\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n        string str = String.Empty;\n        int x = 0;\n        x++;\n}\n\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n        string s = \"\";\n        int y = 0;\n        y = y+1;\n}\n\nAccording to the representation proposed in Reed & De Freitas (2015), the first program is represented as [string str = String.Empty, int x = 0, x++], while the second represented as [string s = \"\", int y = 0, y = y+1].  Although the two programs share the same semantics, they are represented differently due to syntactic variations. In contrast, our work captures the same semantic trace for both programs, i.e., [ [\u201c\u201d, NA], [\u201c\u201d,0], [\u201c\u201d,1]].\n\nTo sum up, the embedding proposed in Reed & De Freitas (2015) is a syntactic representation, and cannot precisely capture a program\u2019s semantics and abstract away its syntactic redundancies. Consequently, the encoder will not be able to learn the true feature dimensions in the embeddings.  We also performed additional experiments to contrast the two trace-based approaches. We used the same configuration of encoder (cf. Section 5) to embed the syntactic traces on the same datasets for the same classification problem. The results are as follows:\n\nProblems                        Reed & De Freitas (2015)          Token                 AST            Dependency Model\nPrint Chessboard                   26.3%                                   16.8%                16.2%                    99.3%\nCount Parentheses                25.5%                                   19.3%                21.7%\t                 98.8%\nGenerate Binary Digits          23.8%                                   21.2%               20.9%\t                 99.2%\n\nAlthough syntactic traces result in better accuracy than Token and AST, they are still significantly worse than semantic embeddings introduced in our work. \n\nOur revision will include the representation proposed in Reed & De Freitas (2015) for the example programs in Figure 1.

The figures in our revision will make these clearer.\n\nDependencies happen primarily in assignment statements. API calls with side effects also introduce dependencies. For example, in the code snippet below,  \u201csb\u201d depends on \u201cs\u201d:\n\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nString s = \u201cstr\u201d;\nsb.Append(s);\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Neural Program Embeddings for Program Repair", "abstract": "Neural program embeddings have shown much promise recently for a variety of program analysis tasks, including program synthesis, program repair, code completion, and fault localization. However, most existing program embeddings are based on syntactic features of programs, such as token sequences or abstract syntax trees. Unlike images and text, a program has well-de\ufb01ned semantics that can be dif\ufb01cult to capture by only considering its syntax (i.e. syntactically similar programs can exhibit vastly different run-time behavior), which makes syntax-based program embeddings fundamentally limited. We propose a novel semantic program embedding that is learned from program execution traces. Our key insight is that program states expressed as sequential tuples of live variable values not only capture program semantics more precisely, but also offer a more natural \ufb01t for Recurrent Neural Networks to model. We evaluate different syntactic and semantic program embeddings on the task of classifying the types of errors that students make in their submissions to an introductory programming class and on the CodeHunt education platform. Our evaluation results show that the semantic program embeddings signi\ufb01cantly outperform the syntactic program embeddings based on token sequences and abstract syntax trees.
