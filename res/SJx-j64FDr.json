This encoding enables SAT solvers to reason about the underlying variables and query existential or counting clauses. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the architectural design choices of the BNN and modifications of the training procedure in order to improve the efficiency of SAT solvers. The modifications are simple but effective and the authors show consistent improvement on different benchmarks without the SAT solver timing out.\n\nOverall, I am leaning towards accepting this paper due to the improved empirical results compared to the baselines the authors build on. However, it does not seem that there is much novelty in the BNN architecture per se, but rather in the training procedure. The modifications are simple but effective. The paper seems to be well-written and easy to follow also from a reader not familiar with the literature in this area.\n\nI would be interested to have an answer to the following concerns:\n\n- It was not totally clear for me what is are the changes that the paper proposes in the block level and network level and if these modifications are present in their experiments.\n- Did you evaluate your method on other image classification datasets, such as CIFAR-10/-100?\n- The thresholding used to sparsify the matrix A^i and seeding the initialization (correct me if I am wrong) when retraining the BNN seems to be really similar to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis [1]. It would be interesting to evaluate the sensitivity of your proposed method towards the initialization.\n\n[1] Jonathan Frankle, Michael Carbin.

Please find our answers below. We will upload an updated paper taking reviewers' suggestions into account in a few days.\n\n>> On comparison exact verification and certification approaches to verification, scalability and accuracy concerns.\n\n[Exact verification and certification methods]. \nThe work of 'Scaling provable adversarial defenses\u2019[1] falls into the category of certification methods[1,6,7] that solve a relaxation of the verification problem.  Our work falls into the category of exact verification methods, similar to [2-4].  We argue that these two approaches are complementary and can be useful in different settings. We highlight few main properties that exact verification methods offer that certification methods cannot provide at the moment:\n\na) accommodate a wide range of verification conditions while certification methods mostly focus on robustness. \n\nb) do not require knowledge of all properties during training, so exact verification methods decouples training and verification procedures (verification is performed after training is completed).  \n\nc) can provide an exact answer to the verification question while certification methods cannot guarantee that they certify all robust inputs (as they are based on an over-approximation of adversarial polytope).\n\nd) [specific to BNNs]  BNNs admit a propositional logic representation, hence we can use techniques that go beyond existential questions that are mostly considered in the work on verification/robustness of NNs, e.g. probabilistic queries [5]. \n\n\n[Scalability] As the reviewer pointed out, scalability is a weak point of all exact methods developed for full-precision or binarized networks. However, we believe that we make a significant step forward in the space of BNN networks compared to the existing work. In fact, we would like to point out that the certification methods line of work had to make few leaps to improve scalability to progress from small, two-layers networks in [6] to large networks in [1].  Making such leaps is even harder for exact methods as they have to provide exact guarantees. Therefore, we believe that our contribution is important as the network we verified is 3 times larger than any BNN-verified network reported in the literature (and we experimented with larger values of epsilons). Moreover, we achieved 10x speed up in verification and  a significant speed up for performing probabilistic queries related to security or fairness on BNN-based models [5], e.g. 12x compared to [5].\n\n[Why experimental setup has such a small model]. \nWe used the original implementation of BNNs from [8] (in PyTorch). Our accuracy is at least as high as that reported in [3-5] for network sizes of the same order of magnitude. As we mentioned above, our network is 3 times larger than any BNN-verified network in the literature.However, we agree that more work is needed to verify medium (for compute vision tasks) networks.\n\nWe agree that it is possible to achieve near state-of-the-art accuracy with BNNs. For example, we would need 3 hidden layers of 4096 neurons in the BNN training framework[8]. This architecture gives a network of 38 million parameters. Such networks are still challenging for SAT/ILP-based technologies. To the best of our knowledge, none of exact verification tools can scale to networks with 38M parameters and 784 inputs for a reasonable epsilon value, e.g. we scaled for epsilon 20/256 in our experiments. \n\n>> Presentation suggestions.\n\nWe will move the SAT encoding mostly to appendix to make space for more experiments in the main part in the updated version.\n\n[1] Eric Wong, Frank R.

We agree that at a high level, we take the same approach that alternates training  and pruning of weights phases. The main conceptual difference is that pruning and training are tightly coupled in our case. Namely, on each forward path we perform -1/0/1 quantization of weights. In [1], the authors train a network until convergence, then prune weights and repeat. So, training and pruning are two separate phases.  We will discuss this connection in the paper.  \n\nWe have not investigated sensitivity to initialization so far. We start with training a full precision network to seed weights before binarized training [4].

The purpose of the new design is to make the network easier to analyze using the existing Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers. An easier analysis is preferable since the SAT solver can be used to infer existing fragility in the network, e.g., adversarial attacks. Empirically, the proposed design of BNN is shown to outperform traditional BNNs by a large margin in terms of detecting adversarial attacks. \n\nOverall, this paper seems to provide a solid contribution to the design of robust BNNs. I like how the authors tried to address various aspects of the networks for easy analysis of SAT solver, i.e., neuron, block, and network-levels even though they only focused on changing the architecture in neuron-level perspective. The experimental results seem to show benefits without any compromise in performance. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper732/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper732/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["n.narodytska@gmail.com", "hongcez@princeton.edu", "aartig@cs.princeton.edu", "toby.walsh@data61.csiro.au"], "title": "In Search for a SAT-friendly Binarized Neural Network Architecture", "authors": ["Nina Narodytska", "Hongce Zhang", "Aarti Gupta", "Toby Walsh"], "pdf": "/pdf/44fb42f333f0090b500e456a747a7ce8b1a57ffd.pdf", "TL;DR": "Formal analysis of  Binarized Neural Networks ", "abstract": "Analyzing the behavior of neural networks is  one of the most pressing challenges in deep learning.

They propose general changes to BNN architectures at the neuron level so as to adapt them for more efficient usage by such tools. Their main contributions are a new design choice utilizing ternary, rather than binary, quantization, and additional variables to propagate through the network containing upper and lower bounds for each layer output. They also suggest further promising directions to adapt BNNs at the block and network level. Their experiments show that the proposed changes do not significantly alter test accuracy from a standard trained baseline model while dramatically reducing the number of model parameters. Consequently, they are able to demonstrate that SAT solvers can find adversarial examples much more quickly with their new architectural alterations.\nOverall, this paper presents a novel contribution with an idea for more efficient BNNs and experimentally verifies the success of their proposed changes. However, there is a concern regarding the experimental setup. \nA large part of the motivation for this task arises from the field of verification regarding adversarial examples. While binarized neural networks are not my area of expertise, I am familiar with a number of verification papers on full neural networks. As such, I find the datasets used, accuracies reported, and model size a bit peculiar. In \u2018Scaling provable adversarial defenses\u2019 (Wong \u201918), the authors were able to verify models with a couple million parameters on both MNIST and CIFAR. In my understanding, the primary advantage of BNNs is their efficiency in having only binary weights. If this is the case, I see no reason why the experimental setup would have such a small model. Additionally, it is generally well-known that MNIST and its variants are not a particularly hard datasets to classify. Many different architectures can easily achieve 98 or 99 percent test accuracy. A quick literature search found \u2018A review of Binarized Neural Networks\u2019 (Simons \u201919), which reports better numbers on MNIST and decent results on CIFAR-10 (and in fact, even ImageNet). Their experimental evidence crucially relies on the conclusion that their techniques allow for faster SAT solver computation *while* maintaining comparable test accuracy. As such, it is my opinion that to be a strong paper, they must show this property holds for larger networks and more significant datasets. \nAdditionally, a comment for the authors to consider: I would suggest switching some of the supplementary materials with the main content. The exposition on BNNs is quite dense and detailed. Some of these details could be moved to the appendix and replaced with more experimental graphs and images. This would provide some breaks in the text so as to provide ease of reading.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper732/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper732/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["n.narodytska@gmail.com", "hongcez@princeton.edu", "aartig@cs.princeton.edu", "toby.walsh@data61.csiro.au"], "title": "In Search for a SAT-friendly Binarized Neural Network Architecture", "authors": ["Nina Narodytska", "Hongce Zhang", "Aarti Gupta", "Toby Walsh"], "pdf": "/pdf/44fb42f333f0090b500e456a747a7ce8b1a57ffd.pdf", "TL;DR": "Formal analysis of  Binarized Neural Networks ", "abstract": "Analyzing the behavior of neural networks is  one of the most pressing challenges in deep learning.
