The paper first argues that achieving privacy guarantees like differential privacy is hard, and then provides frameworks and algorithms that quantify the privacy loss via Signal-to-noise ratio.  In my opinion, one of the main features of this work is to split the NN computation to local computation and cloud computation, which ensures that unnecessary amount of data is never released to the cloud.\n\nComments: I have my concerns about the effectiveness of the notion of privacy introduced in this paper. The definition of privacy loss in Equation 5 is an average notion, where the averaging is performed over all the sensitive training data samples. This notion does not seem to protect the privacy of every individual training example, in contrast to notions like differential privacy. Average case notions of privacy are usually not appreciated in the privacy community because of their vulnerability to a suite of attacks.\n\nThe paper may have a valid point that differential privacy is hard to work with, in the case of Deep NN.

Paper summary \n\nThis paper describes a technique using 3 neural networks to privatize data and make predictions: a feature extraction network, an image classification network, and an image reconstruction network. The idea is to learn a feature extraction network so that the image classification network performs well and the image reconstruction network performs poorly.\n\n\n2. High level paper - subjective\n\nI think the presentation of the paper is somewhat scattered: In section 2 the authors introduce their network and their metric for utility and privacy and then immediately do a sensitivity analysis. Section 3 continues with a sensitivity analysis now considering performance and storage of the method. Then 2.5 pages are spent on channel pruning.\nI would have liked if the authors spent more time justifying why we should trust their method as a privacy preserving technique (described in detail below). \nThe authors clearly performed an impressive amount of sensitivity experiments. Assuming the privacy claims are reasonable (which I have some doubts about below) then this paper is clearly useful to any company wanting to do privacy preserving classification. At the same time I think the paper does not have a significant amount of machine learning novelty in it. \n\n\n3. High level technical\n\nI have a few doubts about this method as a privacy-preserving technique:\n- Nearly every privacy-preserving technique gives a guarantee, e.g., differential privacy guarantees a statistical notion of privacy and cryptographic methods guarantee a computational notion of privacy. In this work the authors provide a way to measure privacy but there is no guarantee that if someone uses this method their data will be private, by some definition, even under certain assumptions.\n- Another nice thing about differential privacy and cryptography is that they are impervious to different algorithms because it is statistically hard or computationally hard to reveal sensitive information. Here there could be a better image reconstruction network that does a better job of reconstructing images than the ones used in the paper.\n- It's not clear to my why PSNR is a useful way to measure privacy loss. I understand that it is a metric to compare two images that is based on the mean-squared error so a very private image should have a low PSNR while a not private image should have a high PSNR, but I have no intuition about how small the PSNR should be to afford a useful amount of privacy. For instances, in nearly all of the images of Figures 21 and 22 I think it would be quite easy to guess the original images.\n\n\n4. 1/2 sentence summary\n\nWhile the authors did an extensive job evaluating different settings of their technique I have serious doubts about it as a privacy-preserving method.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PrivyNet: A Flexible Framework for Privacy-Preserving Deep Neural Network Training", "abstract": "Massive data exist among user local platforms that usually cannot support deep neural network (DNN) training due to computation and storage resource constraints.

As channel pruning and feature selection algorithms are not the core contributions of this work, we did not have sufficient discussion about them in the submitted manuscript due to page limit constraint. We agree with your concern though and we will update our manuscript to include prior work in this area. We will also augment Section 3.4 and the appendix to discuss the requirements for our application on the channel pruning algorithm and the comparison between different pruning algorithms.\n \nChannel pruning and feature selection are indeed important problems that have been studied extensively in the literature. In this work, we used the LDA-based channel selection method to select the features that provide better results. We have compared different unsupervised and supervised channel pruning algorithms, including the methods based on the mean/variance of the weight or the activation as described in (Li et al., 2016) and the LDA-based algorithm. The LDA-based algorithm consistently outperforms other approaches, which is the reason we have used it in this work."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PrivyNet: A Flexible Framework for Privacy-Preserving Deep Neural Network Training", "abstract": "Massive data exist among user local platforms that usually cannot support deep neural network (DNN) training due to computation and storage resource constraints. Cloud-based training schemes provide beneficial services but suffer from potential privacy risks due to excessive user data collection. To enable cloud-based DNN training while protecting the data privacy simultaneously, we propose to leverage the intermediate representations of the data, which is achieved by splitting the DNNs and deploying them separately onto local platforms and the cloud. The local neural network (NN) is used to generate the feature representations. To avoid local training and protect data privacy, the local NN is derived from pre-trained NNs. The cloud NN is then trained based on the extracted intermediate representations for the target learning task. We validate the idea of DNN splitting by characterizing the dependency of privacy loss and classification accuracy on the local NN topology for a convolutional NN (CNN) based image classification task. Based on the characterization, we further propose PrivyNet to determine the local NN topology, which optimizes the accuracy of the target learning task under the constraints on privacy loss, local computation, and storage.
