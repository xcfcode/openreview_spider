In your response to the reviewers you mention that the mimic network always performs 2-3 % worse than the ensemble. This, to me, suggests that the ensemble performs considerably better than the best CNN you trained. Given that my interpretation is correct the performance of the ensemble should be mentioned in the text and it should be clarified in the table that the mimic networks are trained to mimic this ensemble. Furthermore, assuming a 2 percent gap between the ensemble and the mimic network it is possible that trianing i.e. a three layer network, containing the same number of parameters, could shorten this gap. That is, one could imagine a deeper mimic network to actually perform better than the shallow mimic network (as it is in not nearly perfectly mimicing the ensemble). I think this should be tested and reported alongside your results (if I read your comments to the reviewers correctly you have tried, and succeeded, to train deep networks with fewer parameters to mimic larger ones, strongly hinting that this might be a viable strategy for mimicing the ensemble)."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "Currently, deep neural networks are the state of the art on problems such as speech recognition and computer vision.

We completely agree that more results are needed to support the conclusions, and this is why we submitted an extended abstract instead of full paper.  More experiments are underway, but we don't yet have final results to add to the abstract.  Preliminary results suggest that on TIMIT the MIMIC models are not as accurate as the teacher models mainly because we do not have enough unlabeled TIMIT data to capture the function of the teacher models, as opposed to because the MIMIC models have too little capacity or cannot learn a complex function in one layer.  Preliminary results also suggest that: 1) the key to making the shallow MIMIC model more accurate is to train it to be more similar to the deep teacher net, and 2) the MIMIC model is better able to learn to mimic the teacher model when trained on logit (the unnormalized log probabilities) than on the softmax outputs from the teacher net.  The only reason for including the linear layer between the input and non-linear hidden layer is to make training of the shallow model faster, not to increase accuracy.  Experiments suggest that for TIMIT there is little benefit from using more than 250 linear units.\r\n\r\nWe agree with papers such as Seide, Li, and Yu, that shallow nets perform worse than deep nets given the same # of parameters when trained with the current training algorithms.  It is possible that, as Yoshua Bengio suggests, deep models provide a better prior than shallow models for complex learning problems. It is also possible that other training algorithms and regularization methods would allow  shallow models to work as well.   Or it may be a mix of the two.  We believe the question of whether models must be deep to achieve extra accuracy is as yet open, and our experiments on TIMIT provide one data point that suggests it *might* be possible to train shallow models that are as accurate as deeper models on these problems.\r\n\r\nWe have tried using some of the MIMIC techniques to improve the accuracy of deep models.  With the MIMIC techniques we have been able to train deep models with fewer parameters that are as accurate as deep models with more parameters (i.e., reduce the number of weights and number of layers needed in the deep models), but we have not been able to achieve significant increases in accuracy for the deep models.  If compression is done well, the mimic model will be as accurate as the teacher model, but usually not more accurate, because the MIMIC process tries to duplicate the function (I/O behavior) learned by the teacher model in the smaller student model."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "Currently, deep neural networks are the state of the art on problems such as speech recognition and computer vision.

We believe you may have read an older draft and hope that most or all of the misleading statements were corrected in the Jan 3 draft.  Nonetheless, many of your comments still apply to the current paper.\r\n\r\nWe completely agree that generality would be improved with results on additional datasets.  We submitted a workshop abstract instead of full paper because we only had results for one data set, and are about to run experiments on two other datasets.\r\n\r\nWith TIMIT we did not use more training data to train the shallow models than was used to train the deep models.  We used exactly the same 1.1M training cases used to train the DNN and CNN models to train the SNN mimic model.  The only difference is that the mimic SNN does not see the original labels.  Instead, it sees the real-valued probabilities predicted by the DNN or CNN it is trying to mimic.  In general, model compression works best when a large unlabelled data set is available to be labeled by the \u201csmart\u201d model so that the smaller mimic model can be trained \u201chard\u201d with less chance of overfitting.  But for TIMIT unlabelled data was not available so we used the same data used to train the deep models for compression (mimic) training.  We believe that the fact that no extra data --- labeled or unlabelled --- was used to train the SNN models helps drive home the point that it may be possible to train shallow models to be as accurate as deep models.\r\n\r\nWe agree with your comment that \u201cThe paper makes it sound as if we could find a better way to train shallow nets in order to get results as good as deep nets, as if it was just an optimization issue.\u201d, except that we view it more perhaps as an issue of regularization than of just optimization.  In particular, we agree that depth, when combined with current learning and regularization methods such as dropout, is providing a prior that aids generalization, but are not sure that a similar effect could not be achieved using a different learning algorithm and regularization scheme to train a shallow net on the original data.  In some sense we\u2019re making a black-box argument: we already have a procedure that given a training set, yields a shallow net that has accuracy comparable to a deep fully-connected feedforward net trained on the same data.  If we hadn\u2019t shown you what the learning algorithm was in our black box would you have been 100% sure that the wizard behind the curtain must have been deep learning? The real question is whether the black box *must* go through the intermediate step of training a deep model to mimic, or whether there exist other learning and regularization procedures that could achieve the same result without going through the deep intermediary.  We do not (yet) know the answer to this question, but it is interesting that a shallow model can be trained that is as accurate as a deep model without access to any additional data.  We certainly agree that it is difficult to train large, shallow nets on the original targets with the learning procedures currently available.\r\n\r\nWe agree that looking at training errors can be informative, but they might not resolve the issue in this case.  If model compression has access to a very large unlabelled data set, if the mimic model has sufficient capacity to represent the deep model, the shallow model will learn to be a high-fidelity mimic of the deep model and will make the same predictions, and the error of the shallow mimic model and deep model on train and test data will be identical as the error of the mimic predictions compared to the deep model is driven to zero.  This is for the ideal case where we have access to a very large unlabelled data set, which unfortunately we did not have for TIMIT.  Exactly what training errors do you want to see: the error of the DNN on the original training data vs. the error of the SNN trained to mimic the DNN on the real-valued targets, but measured on the original labels of the training points, or vs. the error of an SNN trained on the original data and labels?  Early stopping was used when training the deep models, but was not used when training the mimic SNN models.  In fact we find it very difficult to make the SNN mimic model overfit when trained with L2 loss on continuous targets.\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointers to other papers we should have cited.

The paper makes it sound as if we could find a better way to train shallow nets in order to get results as good as deep nets, as if it was just an optimization issue. My interpretation is quite different. The results seem more consistent with the interpretation that the depth (and convolutions) provide a PRIOR that helps GENERALIZING better. This is consistent with the fact that a much wider network is necessary in the convolutional case, and that in both cases you need to complement the shallow net's training set with the fake/mimic examples (derived from observing the outputs of the deep net on unlabeled examples) in order to match the performance of a deep net. I believe that my hypothesis could be disentangled from the one stated in the paper (which seems to say that it is a training or optimization issue) by looking at training error. According to my hypothesis, the shallow net's training error (without the added fake / mimic examples) should not be significantly worse than that of the deep net (at comparable number of parameters). According to the 'training' hypothesis that the authors seem to state, one would expect training error to be measurably lower for deep nets. In fact, for other reasons I would expect the deep net's training error to be worse (this would be consistent with previous results, starting with my paper with Dumitru Erhan et al in JMLR in 2010). \r\n\r\nIt would be great to report those training errors. Note that to be fair, you have to report training error with no early stopping, continuing training for a fixed and large number of epochs (the same in both cases) with the best learning rate you could find (separately for each type of network).\r\n\r\nFinally, the fact that even shallow nets (especially wide ones) can be hard to train (see Yann Dauphin's ICLR 2013 workshop-track paper) also weakens the hope that we could get around the difficulty of training deep nets by better training shallow nets.\r\n\r\nSeveral more papers need to be cited and discussed. Besides my JMLR 2010 paper with Dumitru Erhan et al (Why Does Unsupervised Pre-training Help Deep Learning), another good datapoint regarding the questions raised here is the paper on Understanding Deep Architectures using a Recursive Convolutional Network, by Eigen, Rolfe & LeCun, submitted to this ICLR 2014 conference. Whereas my JMLR paper is about understanding the advantages of depth as a regularizer, this more recent paper tries to tease apart various architectural factors (including depth) influencing performance, especially for convolutional nets."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?", "decision": "submitted, no decision", "abstract": "Currently, deep neural networks are the state of the art on problems such as speech recognition and computer vision.
