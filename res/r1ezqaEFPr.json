It is realized by two independent contributions: 1). adding a high-to-low-resolution connection in FPN and 2) adding more connecting layers between the mask and classification heads. Experiments show both contributions give a small improvement (~1AP) on both detection and instance segmentation task.\n\nOverall, the method seems reasonable and the improvements are healthy. The main concern is the technical novelty. It is not supervising that adding more connections inside the network can improve some performance. People have tried a lot of that (e.g. M2Det). These kinds of improvements come with a cost of slowdown and are usually not that appealing in practice.\n\nThe motivation for leveraging the relationship between segmentation and detection as a joint model is interesting and relatively new. However, the proposed method of feeding back the regressed bbox for segmentation seems straightforward and far from the full potential. It also requires a larger RoI feature map, which makes the contribution less clear. A fancier method or a more thorough analysis of how the information is shared between the two tasks is demanded for an ICLR publication."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper698/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper698/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Multi-Task Learning via Scale Aware Feature Pyramid Networks and Effective Joint Head", "authors": ["Feng Ni"], "authorids": ["nifeng@pku.edu.cn"], "keywords": ["Multi-Task Learning", "Object Detection", "Instance Segmentation"], "TL;DR": "Our work improve Mask R-CNN by using Scale Aware FPN to remedy scale variation issue and conbining detection and segmentation branches into Effective Joint Head for more expressive multi-task learning.
