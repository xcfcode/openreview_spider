Experiments are designed such that student networks are shallower than teacher networks, while maintaining their width. The method is validated on CIFAR-10 and 100 as well as on Amazon Reviews.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The main novelty of the paper is essentially using the teacher intermediate representations as input to the student network to stabilize the training, and applying the strategy to recent networks and tasks.\n\nThe authors claim that they are only concerned with knowledge transfer between layers of the same width, that is teacher and student network been designed (by model construction) to have the same number of downsampling operations, while maintaining the same number of stages (referred to as sections in the paper). However, resnet-based architectures have been shown to perform iterative refinement of their features between downsampling operations (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07771.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04773.pdf ). Moreover, these models were also shown to be good regularizers, since they can reduce their model capacity as needed (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11332.pdf).  Therefore, having experiments skipping stages would be interesting, and may allow to further compress the networks (by skipping layers or stages which do not incorporate much transformation). Following https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11332.pdf, for the sake of completeness, it might also be interesting to compare LIT results to the ones obtained by just removing layers in the teacher network which have small weight norms.\n\nIn method, the last sentence before \"knowledge distillation loss\" suggests the training of student networks might not be done end-to-end. Could the authors clarify this?\nIt seems there might be a typo in the KD loss of \"knowledge distillation loss\", equation (2). Shouldn't the second term of the equation be a function of p^T and q^T (with temperature)?\n\nI would suggest changing \"sections\" to stages, as previously introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07771.pdf .\n\nAs for the experiments, it would be more interesting to see this kind of analysis on ImageNet (pretained resnet models are readily available).\nFigure 3, why not add hint training as well?\nFigure 4, what's the dataset used here?\n\nIn Section 4.2, it seems that the choice of the IR layer in the analysis could have a significant impact. How was the layer chosen for the ablation study experiments?\n\nThere are a few overstatements in the paper:\n- page 5, paragraph 2: FitNets proposes a general framework to transfer knowledge from a teacher network to a student network through intermediate layers. Thus, the framework itself does not require the student networks to be deeper and thinner than the teacher network.\n- page 6, \"LIT can compress GANs\": authors claim to overcome limitations of KD when it comes to applying knowledge transfer to pixel-wise architecture that do not output distributions. It seems that changing the loss and using a l2 loss instead is a rather minor change, especially since performing knowledge transfer by means of l2 (although at intermediate layers) has already been explored in FitNets.\n\nPlease add references for inception and FID scores.\nPlease fix references format in page 10.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper804/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "LIT: Block-wise Intermediate Representation Training for Model Compression", "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method for reducing the computational over-\nhead of deep network inference, in which the output of a teacher model is used to train\na smaller, faster student model.

It uses hint training and knowledge distillation techniques to compress a \"deep\" network block-wisely. It shows a better compression ratio than knowledge distillation or hint training while achieving comparable accuracy performance.\n\nPros: \n1. This paper considers block-wise compression. For each block, it uses the output of the teacher's last layer as input during training, which improves the learnability of the student models. \n2. The experiments include a large range of tasks, e.g., image classification, sentiment analysis and GAN. \n\nCons:\n1. Validation accuracy is used as the performance metric, which might be over-tuned. How is the performance on testing datasets?\n2. The writing and organization of the paper need some improvement, especially the experiments section.\n3. The compression ratio (3-5) is not very impressive compared with other compression techniques with pruning and quantization techniques, such as Han et al. 2015, Hubara et al. 2016.\n\nIn summary, I think this is an interesting approach to compress deep learning models. But I think the comparisons should be done in terms of testing accuracy. Otherwise, it is hard to judge the performance of this approach. \n\n=== after rebuttal ===\nThanks for the authors' response.

Hyperparameter tuning\n\nThe hyperparameters of alpha and tau are directly taken from KD. The only hyperparameter LIT introduces is beta. We are in the process of updating our results when using separate validation set for hyperparameter selection and test set (see the response to reviewer number 2). Our initial results show that LIT outperforms KD and training from scratch by the same margins.\n\n\n2. Further analysis of training errors\n\nThank you for the suggestion.

Additionally, a 0.5% increase in accuracy corresponds to nearly doubling the depth of the network and corresponds to a 7% reduction in error.\n\n\n4. Pruning method for LIT.\n\nWe used standard pruning proposed by Han et al. 2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626), in which small weights are iteratively removed and the network is retrained at each step.

We have responded to your comments inline. We have improved the manuscript based on your feedback. Our experiments using a test dataset are in progress and we will update the manuscript upon completion.\n\n1. Validation accuracy is used as the performance metric, which might be over-tuned. How is the performance on testing datasets?\n\nThank you for your thoughtful question. We agree with your point that validation accuracy may be over-tuned. We have started to run experiments with a separate test set, which will take some time due to our limited computational resources. We have initial results for ResNet on CIFAR10, which also show that LIT outperforms training from scratch, and KD. The results are essentially the same as the results currently in the manuscript. For ResNet-110 -> ResNet-20 we found that:\n- LIT achieves 93.19%,\n- KD achieves 92.68%,\n- Training from scratch achieves 91.68%\nOnce we have completed the rest of the results, we will update the manuscript with test accuracy.\n\nWe note that the majority of compression papers (including Han et al. 2015 and Hubera et al. 2016, Li et al. 2017 mentioned below, Furlanello et al. 2018, etc.) and the original ResNet and ResNeXt papers use validation accuracy as their primary metric. Additionally, Li et al. 2017 and Conneau et al. 2017 (the original VDCNN paper) refer to validation accuracy as \u201ctest accuracy.\u201d To ensure LIT can be compared against other methods, we will also report validation accuracy, as using a separate test set requires using a different set of data.\n\n\n2. The writing and organization of the paper need some improvement, especially the experiments section.\n\nWe have improved the presentation of the experiments section by removing some redundancy, pointing to the appendix for further experimental details, and adding details for which datasets were used. Are there other points we should address?\n\n\n3. The compression ratio (3-5) is not very impressive compared with other compression techniques with pruning and quantization techniques, such as Han et al. 2015, Hubara et al. 2016.\n\nBoth Han et al. 2015 and Hubara et al. 2016 test on older networks (e.g., VGG) where the majority of the weights are in the fully connected layers. Compressing the FC layer can achieve up to ~10x compression, while compressing the convolutional layers achieves around ~1.14x compression. As the majority of weights for these older networks are in the FC layer, this achieves high compression rates for these networks.\n\nCompressing modern networks is significantly harder. For example, Li et al. 2017 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08710.pdf) only achieves ~1.6x compression on ResNet (which achieves significantly higher accuracy than VGG). We believe our results should be compared against other methods for compressing _modern_ networks. We have made this point more clear in the paper.\n\nAdditionally, in this work, we focus on compression techniques that can improve inference throughput on existing hardware. Pruning and quantization generally require special hardware (e.g., Han et al. 2016\u2019s EIE https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01528) for inference improvements."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper804/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper804/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper804/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "LIT: Block-wise Intermediate Representation Training for Model Compression", "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method for reducing the computational over-\nhead of deep network inference, in which the output of a teacher model is used to train\na smaller, faster student model.
