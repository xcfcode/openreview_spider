This makes the paper more convincing. However, the main concern that this paper lacks theoretical contribution still exists. Therefore, I keep the weak acceptance recommendation. \n\nSummary:\n\nIn this paper, the authors made a study on Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) in the training dynamics. By tracking the trace of FIM in the initial training process, the authors show that it can be strongly connected to a model\u2019s generalization performance. This successfully explains why some hyper-parameter choices lead to significantly better generalization. Finally, empirical evaluations show that penalizing the trace FIM can reduce memorization and encourage wide minima solution, leading to better generalization.\n\nPros:\n\nThis paper takes one step forward to the question of why some hyper-parameter choices (small batch size or large learning rate) lead to better generalization. In many previous works, the implicit regularization effect of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) accounts for this observation (small batch size generalizes better). Most of the above works focused on the anisotropic noise in SGD. However, there is still a gap between the anisotropic noise and implicit regularization, i.e. why does anisotropic noise lead to implicit regularization hence better generalization. [1] explains this in a very general way: it helps to escape local minima. This paper tries to fill in the gap by leveraging FIM. \n\nFIM is also studied in the context of SGD regularization [2]. However, it only shows that the trace of FIM affects optimization performance. How it relates to the generalization performance still remains unknown. Section 4 and section 5 shed light on this question by drawing connection to memorization and final curvatures. \n\nLarger scale dataset such as Tiny-Imagenet is included in the experiments. This shows that the conclusion also stands on a more practical and noisy dataset. \n\nCons:\n\nMost of the empirical verifications in this paper are comparing large and small learning rates. To be more general, the authors can also include the study of batch size. The central claim in this paper would be more convincing if catastrophic Fisher explosion also occurs in large batch training. More importantly, reducing the trace can improve large batch training generalization. Additionally, the connection between FIM and noisy gradient descent [3] is worth mentioning. For example, how does the trace of FIM in noisy gradient descent compared to other methods?\n\nOne of the postulations is regularizing the trace of FIM reduces memorization. The paper verifies this by introducing noisy labels. This requires modification to the training dataset. Another way to verify this postulation is to make comparisons on out-of-distribution dataset (CIFAR10-C and CIFAR100-C). The method which reduces memorization should be more robust on out-of-distribution datasets.\n\nA majority of the analysis comes from empirical evaluations. The claim is more convincing if the conclusion can also be analytically proved in the convex quadratic scenario. \nThe experiments section of this paper is based on the empirical Fisher matrix (true Fisher matrix is expensive to compute). Although empirical Fisher is commonly used in practice to approximate true Fisher, the approximation is only accurate in the local minima [4]. The paper should have a discussion on the difference between true Fisher and empirical Fisher. \n\nLegends are missing in Figure 4 and Figure 6. \n\n[1]: Zhu, Zhanxing et al. \u201cThe Anisotropic Noise in Stochastic Gradient Descent: Its Behavior of Escaping from Sharp Minima and Regularization Effects.\u201d ICML (2019).\n[2]: Wen, Yeming et al. \u201cAn Empirical Study of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Structured Covariance Noise.\u201d AISTATS (2020).\n[3]: Wu, Jingfeng et al. \u201cOn the Noisy Gradient Descent that Generalizes as SGD.\u201d ICML (2020)\n[4]: Kunstner, Frederik et al. \u201cLimitations of the empirical Fisher approximation for natural gradient descent.\u201d NeurIPS (2019).", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

I can finally understand your point.\n\nEven though, I find the writing of this paper is misleading and needs to be improved. Eq. (2) and Appendix C can only misguide readers like me. If you are studying trace Fisher, why not use the typical unbiased estimator like $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\\\\\| g(x_i)\\\\\\|^2$? From both statistics and optimization, I see no point of inventing a unusual estimator $ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum \\\\\\|\\frac{1}{B} \\sum g(x_i)\\\\\\|^2$ which lowers bound the usual one. I think your estimator is not even unbiased.\n\nAlso, I think \"gradient norm\" usually refers to the norm of full gradient. But in this paper, it seems to refer to the norm of a stochastic/mini-batch gradient. This is also a reason that I misunderstood the authors' intention in the first place.\n\nI will raise my rating to weak reject, since the experiments are now also conducted for the unbiased estimator of trace Fisher, and the conclusion agrees with the paper. However I tend to not accept the paper for two reasons. \n- The writing needs to be improved. Unnecessary experiments and irrelevant argument should be removed.

This claim is supported by the similar generalization behavior of SGD (with optimal learning rate) and Fisher penalization (for SGD with small learning rate). A series experiments are conducted to verify the understanding.\n\nI find the paper writing is rather misleading. On the one hand, no mathematical justifications, and the logical chain is weak --- hard to claim which factor is the cause and which one is the effect. On the other hand, though written as \"trace of Fisher\" in the paper, in experiments they compute a different regularizer --- norm of expected gradient. Detailed questions come in the following.\n\n# Questions\n\n1. Abstract, \"We highlight that in the absence of implicit or explicit regularization...\". How do you get rid of the implicit regularization???\n\n2. Eq.(2) is super misleading. Trace of Fisher is the expected gradient norm, but in Eq. (2) you compute norm of expected gradient. Statistically the latter has nothing to do with the former: one is the second moment, and the other is the squared first moment. Please justify.\n\n3. I have a very simple explanation to your observed phenomenon. In the beginning, gradient is large, thus your version of \"trace of fisher\" is large, as the gradient decreases, the \"trace of fisher\" decreases. Now we look at large learning rate and small learning rate. With large learning rate, SGD converges faster, thus its gradients decrease faster, which causes the \"trace of fisher\" decreases faster. But with small learning rate, SGD converges slower, thus its gradient decrease slower, and the \"trace of fisher\" appears to be large in the beginning epochs.\n\nTherefore I am not at all convinced by your arguments. \n\n4. From the above discussion, at least you need to normalize the \"trace of fisher\" by gradient norm --- which then becomes a measurement of gradient confusion. See following for references.\n\n5. FP/GP. If I understand correctly, you need to compute gradient of gradient, which expands your computation graph at least twice. Can you report the GPU memory consumption? \n\n6. Finally, let us take about the practical role of FP. According to Table 1, the improvement of FP over GP is marginal. I cannot see a potential of FP. Not only in theory, but also in practice this paper is not satisfactory. \n\n\n# Missing Refs\nTons of theory paper should be discussed.  A few of them come to my brain are listed in below.

More specifically, the thesis would be that \"implicit regularization in SGD introduced by using a large learning rate can be explicitly introduced as gradient norm regularization\". Please note that this is precisely the thesis in [1,2].\n\nIn fact, we already have discussed in the paper that our experiments are more consistent with the hypothesis that  \"implicit regularization in SGD introduced by using a large learning rate can be explicitly modeled by penalizing $Tr(F)$\" than with \"gradient norm impacts generalization\" (more on that below).  This is precisely the reason we tested gradient norm penalty. The key argument in our mind is that regularizing gradient norm does not always close the generalization gap arising from using a small learning rate, while Fisher Penalty always does.\n\nWhile we already have discussed this point in related work, we will make it clearer.\n\n**In short, the fact our experiemental data is also (but to a lesser degree, see below) consistent with the hypothesis that implicit regularization in SGD can be explicitly modeled as gradient norm regularization (see also [1,2]) is not a weakness of the paper.**\n\n**Reiterating why $Tr(F)$ is more directly related to generalization than gradient norm**\n\nWe reiterate here points from the paper why it is actually the hypothesis (stated in a simplified manner) \"Fisher matrix impacts generalization\" is more consistent with the results in the paper than \"gradient norm impacts generalization\".\n\nFirst, please let us reiterate that (1) we do not use the full-batch gradient, but a mini-batch gradient, in Fisher Penalty. This is vastly different from using the full-batch gradient, and the provided example is not applicable, (2) we do not use training labels but resample them from the predictive distribution $p(y|x)$, (3) we show that regularizing $Tr(F)$ (i.e. without using the approximation) is effective. \n\nMost importantly, we would like to also reiterate key evidence from the paper that shows that optimizing trace of the Fisher more directly impacts generalization, and hence we believe that \"Fisher matrix impacts generalization\" is a warranted hypothesis that we tested well (as pointed out by all the other reviewers):\n\n1. We added experiments showing that one can directly regularize $Tr(F)$ which has a similar effect on generalization. This experiment strongly suggests that approximations made in Fisher Penalty do not impact the conclusions\n\n2. The key argument in our mind is that regularizing gradient norm does not always close the generalization gap arising from using a small learning rate, while Fisher Penalty (as well as the direct version in the experiment described in Appendix C) always does\n\n3. Regularizing gradient norm in some experiments that do not use a small learning rate (e.g. memorization) performs substantially worse than Fisher Penalty\n\n**Other thoughts**\n\nOur guess is that you find this to be a weakness because you do not find the motivation clear enough. We believe that it is an important open research question how (mechanically) using a large learning rate or a small batch size improves generalization. Showing a connection to the gradient norm of some variant (in our case with resampled labels from $p(y|x)$) is an important step towards answering this question (as agreed by R2-R4).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g87C4KwB\n\n[2] https://openreview.net/forum?id=jh-rTtvkGeM"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

But I still do not agree with your argument here.\n\nIn Appendix C, you only show the second order moment upper bounds the squared first order moment, which is a fairly well-known fact in basic probability course. But this does not imply that the squared first order moment is an approximation to the second order moment. Counter example is shown in my previous comment.\n\nI also would like to point out that, when you minimize an objective, sometimes it is OK to minimize its upper bound if the upper bound is tight at the optimal (e.g., variational inference, EM algorithm); but it is typically not OK to minimize its lower bound, as you do in Eq. (2).\n\nI want to apologize to use the word \"meaningless\" to description your work. I agree your empirical results illustrate certain effect of regularizing squared gradient norm/tract of Fisher. But I think the writing is misleading.\n\nI would like to emphasize that, the current experiments are not sufficient to prove that \"Fisher matrix impacts generalization\". Due to the same logic as yours and based on your experiments, one can also claim \"gradient norm impacts generalization\", instead of \"Fisher impacts generalization\".\n\nIf you want to claim the regularization of SGD is caused by Fisher, you need to do ablation study to show some inverse results; otherwise it is possible that they are only correlated, instead of having causal relationship. \nI therefore think the writing of the paper is misleading.

This is why our paper discusses the regularization effects due to using SGD with a large learning rate. We believe that this way to use the phrase \u2018implicit regularization\u2019 is fairly standard in the literature. It is also used in the aforementioned [1,2], as well as [3], for example. \n\n**\u201cPlease at least conduct experiments against better baselines and for larger datasets like ImageNet\u201d**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that we run experiments on ImageNet (in the first part) and Tiny ImageNet (in the second part).\n\n**\u201dI strongly feel that in the SOTA setups [...] For example, it is easily to achieve around 85% acc for CIFAR100, then what is the meaning to compete with some 75% baselines in 2020?\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cited performance is achieved by (a small) DenseNet, which we believe can be still seen as a modern architecture. We will happy to try to include larger models in the final version.\n\n**\u201dThe paper you cited does not make sense to me. For example, in [1], the coefficient for the regularization term scales with learning rate, which is very small in their theory, thus it basically does nothing. Please refer to Theorem 2.1 in [Kushner & Yin, 2003], which proves that as learning rate goes to zero, SGD goes to gradient flow, there is no non-trivial regularization.\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our paper, as well as the cited [1,2], argue that the implicit regularization role of using a large learning rate can be understood and introduced explicitly as gradient norm regularization. Now this effect is happening mostly in the early phase of training, see for example [4, 5]. Hence, the fact that SGD can be seen as gradient flow is not in contradiction to results in [1-5].

In general, reviewers R2, R3 and R4 agree that the work is an important step towards answering one of the key questions in deep learning theory: what is the exact mechanism by which using a large learning rate impacts generalization in SGD. \n\nThe reviewers found the paper well-written, and the hypothesis well-motivated, posed, and tested. We are also happy to hear that the developed regularizer to test the hypothesis, Fisher Penalty, was interesting on its own.\n\nWe summarize below the feedback from reviewers, the extra experiments that we run, and the main points in the rebuttal.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* R2, R3, R4 reviewers highlight that we took an important step towards answering one of the mysteries in deep learning theory: what is the mechanism by which using a large learning rate improves generalization. \nR2 wrote *\u201cThe paper's motivation is definitely relevant.  [...] The introduced Fisher-penalty is interesting and the authors provide insights into the mechanism how regularizing the trace of FIM might improve generalization. \u201d*. \nR3 wrote \u201clarge learning rate/small batch sizes (which tends to lead to improved generalization) can be realized as implicitly penalizing the trace of Fisher\u201d.\nR4 wrote *\u201cBy tracking the trace of FIM in the initial training process, the authors show that it can be strongly connected to a model\u2019s generalization performance. This successfully explains why some hyper-parameter choices lead to significantly better generalization\u201d*.\n\n* To test the hypothesis we had to develop a novel regularizer, Fisher Penalty, which was appreciated by all reviewers. In particular, R2 wrote, \u201cThe introduced Fisher-penalty is interesting and the authors provide insights into the mechanism how regularizing the trace of FIM might improve generalization.\u201d\n\n* R2 and R3 highlight that the hypothesis is well-posed (*\u201cThe paper is well-written and easy to follow. Authors convey their message clearly.\u201d*) and the execution and design of experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis is clear (*\u201cthis paper does a good job from the empirical standpoint, the experiments are done in a clean and systematic way to verify the hypotheses.\u201d.*)\n\n**Cons. Extra experiments and answers to key questions**\n\n* R3, R4, and R5 were confused about whether we estimate the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), or the trace of the \u201cEmpirical\u201d Fisher Information Matrix, which might not reflect the FIM [1]. We are sorry for writing being unclear on this. We do actually measure FIM, which is a key strength of the paper. We will clarify it in the paper.\n\n* We added experiments showing catastrophic Fisher explosion in large batch-size training, as suggested by R4. This suggests the core claim of the paper extends to the implicit regularization role of using a small batch size.\n\n* R5 suggested an alternative (\u201cvery simple\u201d) explanation of our results: that catastrophic Fisher explosion does happen in training under a large learning rate, but we \u201cmiss\u201d it due to too coarsely grained computation of Tr(F). We added a section in the appendix where we run extra experiments that show that we do measure Tr(F) with enough frequency, and catastrophic Fisher explosion does not happen in training with large learning rate.\n\n* R5 found the Eq (2) \u201csuper misleading\u201d. We provided additional explanations. We hope it is clear now.\n\n* R2 pointed out that it seems inconsistent with our hypothesis (stating that implicit regularization in SGD can be explicitly introduced using Fisher Penalty) that Fisher Penalty sometimes works better when it is applied after a relatively short training time (e.g. 1-3% of the training time). We provided an argument that the wide-spread practice of gradually increasing the learning rate shows that using a large learning rate in the first iteration can also be suboptimal. This is an important point and we will clarify writing on this.\n\n* R3 and R4 suggested adding a more theoretical basis to the claim that implicit regularization in SGD can be seen as regularizing the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix. We propose to add a more detailed discussion of generalization bounds. In particular, authors of [2] found that sharpness based bounds are best correlated with generalization across a range of experiments.\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Kunstner, Frederik, Philipp Hennig, and Lukas Balles. \"Limitations of the empirical Fisher approximation for natural gradient descent.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2019.\n\n[2] Yiding Jiang, Behnam Neyshabur, Hossein Mobahi, Dilip Krishnan, Samy Bengio, \u201cFantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them\u201d, https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02178\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

Please find our answers below and let us know should any additional experiments or answers be helpful.\n\n**\u201cValidation accuracy between turning on FP from the very beginning and only turning it on somewhat later is not always negligible. This observation somewhat violates the 'earlier we regularize the better' idea. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That\u2019s a very good point. Interestingly, a standard trick of the trade is to gradually increase the learning rate in the early phase of training, which is usually referred to as \u201cwarmup\u201d.It is default for training Transformers in NLP, for example.\n\nHence, applying a large learning rate from the first iteration of training is often suboptimal. We believe the experiments in Figure 4 suggest the same is true for Fisher Penalty, which would be consistent with the core claim of the paper that Fisher Penalty mimics the way large learning rate improves generalization. \n\nMore specifically, Figure 4 shows that Fisher Penalty has to be applied within a relatively short window in the beginning of training (~1-3% training time, full training time is between 200 to 300 epochs depending on the setting). If Fisher Penalty is applied later than 1-3% training time, we cannot recover from bad generalization due to using a too small learning rate (which can be read from the graph as the time the curve intersects the horizontal line). It is also worth noting that, as visible in Figure 1 (and see also Figure 15 and Figure 16), the initial growth of TrF can take a few epochs. This further suggests that large TrF in these scenarios is not happening in the first iteration, which might explain why there is no need (yet) to apply Fisher Penalty in the first iteration. \n\nIn summary, we will revise our writing to reflect that just like warm-up in learning rate shows that using a too large learning rate from the very first iteration can be bad for generalization, using a too aggressive Fisher Penalty from the very first iteration can be bad for generalization. And analogously, just like using a large learning rate is enabled by warm-up, Figure 4 shows that using a large Fisher Penalty is beneficial when applied after a short training time (~1-3%). \n\nThank you for raising this point. Please let us know if you have any further comments on this.\n\n**\u201dSecond, the benefit of high early regularization is somewhat inconclusive based on Fig. 10. It appears that the best generalization belongs to low early regularization, whereas high early regularization leads to better average test accuracy.\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for focusing on this figure. It turns out that there was a minor bug in the test data loader (we evaluated on a subset of the test set which increased the variance) used in that experiment which resulted in this unexpected behavior. We re-ran the experiment after fixing it and we have updated Figure 6 & Figure 10. \n\nWe now indeed find that the runs with higher initial regularization indeed have higher best test accuracy along the trajectory compared with runs with lower initial regularization. Additionally, the higher initial regularization runs have lower values of curvature of the Hessian at the point corresponding to the best test accuracy.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

These examples will learn slower when Fisher Penalty is applied. \n\nThere is one specific case in which we could imagine Fisher Penalty (as well as using a large learning rate) to trap the model in a bad solution.

To the extent to which sharpness based bounds are sensible bounds on generalization, Tr(F) can be argued to lead to tighter generalization bounds.\n\n**\u201dJust to verify- the Fisher matrix which is computed throughout is the empirical estimate of the true Fisher and not the \"empirical Fisher\"- as the labels are sampled from the predictive distribution?\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes. To approximate the FIM, we sample y from the model prediction p(y|x), and not use the training label. Hence it is not the \"empirical FIM\" mentioned in [1], but is rather a Monte Carlo estimate of the actual FIM. This is mentioned below Equation 2, and more details on the penalty are provided in Appendix C.\n\n[1] Kunstner, Frederik, Philipp Hennig, and Lukas Balles. \"Limitations of the empirical Fisher approximation for natural gradient descent.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2019.\n\n**\u201dI am wondering if the authors compared their approach to even more closely-related methods such as input-output Jacobian regularization [2], regularizing by the Frobenius norm of Fisher; Tr(F^2) instead of Tr(F), and the Fisher-Rao norm.\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We indeed included the results for input-output Jacobian regularization along with Fisher penalty (FP) in the paper. We call this regularization $GP_x$ in the paper and the results are shown in Figure 3 and Table 3. In Figure 3, we trained on the clean CIFAR-100 dataset with these regularizations using ResNet and VGG architectures. \n\nWe found that for ResNet both regularizations perform similarly, while for VGG, FP is substantially better than FP. In Table 3, we experimented with the effect of these regularizations on preventing memorization when training on a corrupted version of the CIFAR-100 training set with different levels of label noise. We found that FP performs substantially better than GP_x in all cases. The same experiments for CIFAR-10 are shown in Figure 8 and Table 4  in the appendix. Overall, we found that FP performs best under the various settings while GP_x performs similarly under some settings but worse under others. Due to the increasing amount of resources needed, we did not try the other variants of Fisher norm, but we will definitely include references to them.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

Please let us know any other experiments you would like us to run, or if you have any questions.\n\n**\u201dI have a very simple explanation to your observed phenomenon\u201d**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is indeed not yet a widely known phenomenon and it is genuinely surprising that learning rate impacts the geometry of the trajectory over the loss surface in the early phase of training. Hence, we understand where you are coming from and agree we could have done a better job highlighting that it is now a well researched and corroborated phenomenon. \n\nThe surprising effect of the learning rate on the geometry of the loss surface (e.g. the value of $Tr(\\mathbf{F})$) was demonstrated in prior works cited in the introduction [1,2] ([1] was published in ICLR\u201920). In particular, [1] shows that training with a large learning rate escapes rapidly regions of high curvature, where the curvature was defined as the spectral norm of the Hessian evaluated at the current point on the loss surface. \n\nPerhaps the most direct evidence against the hypothesis proposed by the reviewer can be found in Figure 1 in [3] (not our work, under review at ICLR), where training with Gradient Descent rapidly finds regions of the loss surface with large curvature in the early phase (close to $\\frac{2}{\\eta}$) for small learning rates. \n\nWe also run the following experiment to provide further evidence against the hypothesis. We train SimpleCNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset using two different learning rates, while computing the value of $Tr(\\mathbf{F})$ at every *iteration*. We use $128$ random samples in each iteration. *We find that training with a large learning rate never (even for a single step) enters a region with the maximum value of $Tr(\\mathbf{F})$ reaching as much as those reached with a small learning rate during training. Figure 15 in the updated paper shows the experimental data.* \n\nWe also found a similar trend to hold when varying the batch size, which further suggests that the results in the paper cannot be explained by the difference in learning speed between the experiments using small and large learning rates. This result is presented in Figure 16 in the updated version.\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1g87C4KwB\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02218\n\n[3] https://openreview.net/forum?id=jh-rTtvkGeM\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

By implicit regularization we were referring to the generalization effect of a reasonably large learning rate. We suppress its regularization effect by using lower values of learning rate (which we refer to as a sub-optimal learning rate in the paper). We apologize if it were not clear, and we will improve background and motivation in the paper.\n\n**\"Finally, let us take about the practical role of FP. According to Table 1, the improvement of FP over GP is marginal. I cannot see a potential of FP. Not only in theory, but also in practice this paper is not satisfactory.\"**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference is approximately 2% for DenseNet/C100 and VGG11/C100 and 4% on SimpleCNN/C10. In these cases we would like to argue it is not marginal by the standards of the computer vision community. \n\nIn the other two (out of 5) cases you are right - they are similar. However, even if they are similar, that\u2019s actually still exciting. We are primarily excited about the theoretical importance of the finding that we can explain away an important aspect of implicit regularization in SGD. Please note that two other works were concurrently submitted to ICLR that propose only gradient norm regularization as the implicit regularizer [1,2].\n\nOn a practical role of FP, let us also draw your attention to experiments involving noisy labels. In these experiments (Table 3) FP was substantially better than GP_x, and comparable to mixup. Please note that gradient norm regularization hasn\u2019t been shown to be effective in this setting before.\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=rq_Qr0c1Hyo\n\n[2] https://openreview.net/forum?id=3q5IqUrkcF\n\n**\"From the above discussion, at least you need to normalize the \"trace of fisher\" by gradient norm --- which then becomes a measurement of gradient confusion.

Authors demonstrate that the effect of optimally chosen learning rate and batch size for SGD can be modeled as an implicit penalty on the trace of FIM. They argue that explicitly penalizing the trace of FIM discourages memorizing noisy labels, thus leading to better generalization. Furthermore, they experimentally show that the early low value of the trace of FIM may bias the optimization towards a flat optimum which has been observed to correlate well with good generalization.\n\n*Positives:*\n+ The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Authors convey their message clearly.\n+ The paper's motivation is definitely relevant. Understanding the connection between the early stage loss landscape of neural networks and final generalization is crucial and has drawn significant attention recently.\n+ The introduced Fisher-penalty is interesting and the authors provide insights into the mechanism how regularizing the trace of FIM might improve generalization.\n\n*Negatives:*\n- The exact mechanism how FP influences learning with noisy labels could be investigated a bit more rigorously. The discussion provided in the paper is not completely clear.\n- The experiments are somewhat inconclusive in some cases (see below) and would require some extra comments/explanation.\n\nOverall, the paper has some interesting contribution by demonstrating the positive effect of various gradient norm penalties on the generalization of SGD and it is tied well into existing literature. Furthermore, the experiments are comprehensive and in-depth. Therefore I would recommend acceptance if a couple of issues are addressed.\n\nFirst, as seen in Fig. 4 generalization peaks if FP is applied starting after some positive number of epochs. The difference in validation accuracy between turning on FP from the very beginning and only turning it on somewhat later is not always negligible. This observation somewhat violates the 'earlier we regularize the better' idea. Can the authors comment on this discrepancy?\n\nSecond, the benefit of high early regularization is somewhat inconclusive based on Fig. 10. It appears that the best generalization belongs to low early regularization, whereas high early regularization leads to better average test accuracy. I would be interested to know how much FP might hinder optimization by discouraging the exploration of certain directions in the loss landscape. Can it even contribute to trapping the network in local optima by penalizing large gradients needed to escape such 'bad' optima?\n\nMinor comment: there is a typo in the caption of Fig. 6.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.

There are a few core insights which are verified empirically across a number of different models and datasets: (1) large learning rate/small batch sizes (which tends to lead to improved generalization) can be realized as implicitly penalizing the trace of Fisher and (2) how regularizing the trace of Fisher discourages memorization and guides optimization to \"flatter minima\". \n\nMy overall assessment of this paper leans towards positive. While it is probably not surprising to deep learning optimization/generalization researchers that the trace of FIM is closely related to generalization performance, this paper does a good job from the empirical standpoint, the experiments are done in a clean and systematic way to verify the hypotheses. \n\nSome comments/remarks/questions:\n\n- The manuscript is overall well-written; I have no problems following the logic and the experimental setups. Related works for the most part are discussed throughly and well-explained. A downside is that there is completely no theoretical arguments given in the paper, I am wondering if it's possible even in the case of a convex quadratic/extremely simple networks, the authors can show how a small Tr(F) leads to a tighter/better generalization bound? \n\n- Just to verify- the Fisher matrix which is computed throughout is the empirical estimate of the true Fisher and not the \"empirical Fisher\"- as the labels are sampled from the predictive distribution? This often results in a confusion; see [1] for more details. \n\n- In Section 3, the authors compared FP with GP which is a fair comparison. I am wondering if the authors compared their approach to even more closely-related methods such as input-output Jacobian regularization [2], regularizing by the Frobenius norm of Fisher; Tr(F^2) instead of Tr(F), and the Fisher-Rao norm which has a tight relationship with capacity/generalization of neural networks as shown in [3].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Kunstner, Frederik, Philipp Hennig, and Lukas Balles. \"Limitations of the empirical Fisher approximation for natural gradient descent.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2019.\n\n[2] Novak, Roman, et al. \"Sensitivity and generalization in neural networks: an empirical study.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.08760 (2018).\n\n[3] Liang, Tengyuan, et al. \"Fisher-rao metric, geometry, and complexity of neural networks.\" The 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics. 2019.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2346/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Catastrophic Fisher Explosion: Early Phase Fisher Matrix Impacts Generalization", "authorids": ["~Stanislaw_Kamil_Jastrzebski1", "~Devansh_Arpit2", "~Oliver_\u00c5strand1", "~Giancarlo_Kerg1", "~Huan_Wang1", "~Caiming_Xiong1", "~richard_socher1", "~Kyunghyun_Cho1", "~Krzysztof_J._Geras1"], "authors": ["Stanislaw Kamil Jastrzebski", "Devansh Arpit", "Oliver \u00c5strand", "Giancarlo Kerg", "Huan Wang", "Caiming Xiong", "richard socher", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Krzysztof J.
