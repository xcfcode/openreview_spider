We below address them and have posted a new version of the paper.\n\nRegarding Lemma 3.2: You are correct about the trivial bound, but the bound would not be as tight without the other term. In any case, please refer to our response about Lemma 3.2 to Reviewer 4. We have modified the result to include the requirement that weights be capped, which also provides further intuition into the algorithm and how to select the cap.\n\nRegarding comparison with existing methods: We added a paragraph discussing relationships between our work and the existing ones that Reviewer 4 pointed out in the related work.\n\nRegarding delta-graded classifiers: Again, please refer to our response to Reviewer 4. The notion of delta-graded classifiers is necessary in order to extract information from a a large class of models and generalizes how Dhurandhar et al (2018) attach probes to different layers of a neural network to generate predictions from various layers of a neural network. As in Dhurandhar et al (2018), using such information proved to be useful here, in comparison to simply using the final prediction of a model (which is labelled ConfWeight in our experiments). We further clarify this in the beginning of Section 3 (Methodology).\n\nRegarding what additional information the proposed method exploits: Indeed, using a weighting that includes the predictions of the simple model is the key difference from all other works, and judging from our experiments, is a significant differentiator from other weighting schemes.\n\nRegarding what fractions of points were suppressed: Figure 1 (left) demonstrates that less than 1% of points were suppressed as being too difficult for the simple model (no points are suppressed by only using the complex model predictions). \n\nRegarding Minor Comments: Please note that, regarding the title, we are leveraging the simple model predictions (along with the complex model predictions) to enhance those of a simple model, so \"its\" refers to the Simple model. We can remove \"its\" if it is still not clear. We have made a thorough pass and did some rewriting, fixing long sentences, and improving the overall flow.

We hope to address your concerns with the following responses:\n\nRegarding the presentation of the work and graded classifiers: We have made a thorough pass through the paper to address the writing, as well as take into account your specific comments such as our introduction to the graded classifiers (please refer to the beginning of Section 3 Methodology).  Graded classifiers are a generalization of the concept of probes used for neural networks in Dhurandhar et al 2018. In short, the graded classifiers extract useful intermediate information from the complex classifiers, in the same way that a probe could be attached to an intermediate layer of a neural network to see how useful the layers up to a certain point are for prediction. The parameter gamma could be chosen such that I only includes the final prediction of the complex model, however experiments have shown that using the mean of predictions from other models in the set of what we call delta-graded classifiers gives better performance in our framework than using only the final complex model. We have put more emphasis on Sections 3.1 and 3.2, which we think will be greatly improved by our modified Lemma 3.2.\n\nRegarding the effect of changing the number of graded classifiers: The number of classifiers to use is tuned by paramater gamma. For the case of neural networks, Dhurandhar et al 2018 already showed that it was useful to use more than only the final output of the complex model, as well as to throw out graded classifiers that achieved worse performance than the simple model (albeit using weights that were not divided by the simple model predictions as we do here). \n\nRegarding Lemma 3.2's connection to algorithm 1: Please see the response to Reviewer 4. We have modified the result to include the requirement that weights be capped, which also provides further intuition into the algorithm and how to select the cap.\n\nRegarding connections to importance sampling ratios in off policy evaluation in reinforcement learning and counterfactual analysis: Indeed, our scheme looks very related and we have tried to make such connections but have not been able to do so as of yet.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper369/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper369/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Leveraging Simple Model Predictions for Enhancing its Performance", "authors": ["Amit Dhurandhar", "Karthikeyan Shanmugam", "Ronny Luss"], "authorids": ["adhuran@us.ibm.com", "karthikeyan.shanmugam2@ibm.com", "rluss@us.ibm.com"], "keywords": ["simple models", "interpretability", "resource constraints"], "TL;DR": "Method to improve simple models performance given a (accurate) complex model.", "abstract": "There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations.

We have addressed most of your comments below and posted a new version of the paper. \n\nRegarding Lemma 3.1: The inequality we use for the cross-entropy loss is actually correct - note that it holds for $0 \\leq p,q \\leq 1$ where the weight is $p/q$ (for Lemma 3.2, the weight is a function of a different pretrained model's q so the needed inequality is different). The inequality holds for the true class y* throughout Lemma 3.1. Regardless, we do agree that the connection to Algorithm 1 is not direct as it is for Lemma 3.2 (see below) as other reviewers note, so we have removed Lemma 3.1 to improve the flow of the paper.\n\nRegarding Lemma 3.2: Thank you for finding the mistake. In fact, if we assume that the weights are clipped at a level beta (which we do in our experiments), then one can fix the inequality by introducing a slack term which is logarithmic in beta, i.e., $\\log(wx) \\leq w \\log(x) + \\log(\\beta)$ for all $\\beta \\geq w \\geq 1$ and $x > 1$. This leads to a bound where the slack term is log(beta) - E[log of the clipped weight] which is always positive and characterizes the bias due to clipping. This offers users a way to tune the bound.\n\nRegarding $\\theta*$: You are right that we need not consider the optimal simple model. We mean theta* to be the result of any simple model's training algorithm, without any weighting. It is indeed important that $p_c/p_{\\theta*}$ stays above 1 with high probability so that the slack term remains small. This motivates using a complex model for p_c. \n\nRegarding your comment \"Assuming the complex teacher classifiers are very accurate ... reweighting training examples by $\\max(1, p_c/p_{\\theta*})$ does not provide too much information...\": This suggestions seems true if our weight was simply $p_c$, however we're using $p_c/p_{\\theta*}$, and this weight can be arbitrarily larger than 1. Consider the case when the complex model is much more confident than the simple model. Inclusion of $p_{\\theta*}$ into this weight is the key novelty in this work. To our knowledge, no other work uses information from the simple model in a transfer framework. This will lead to a higher weighting of the point, whereas distillation tries to fit to a soft label $p_c$ (possibly temperature rescaled) which is a different transfer framework. \n\nRegarding per-sample hardness reweighting: We do not claim that per-sample hardness reweighting is novel. We clearly refer to other works that have done such schemes (e.g. Dhurandhar et al 2018). Our novelty claim is specific to the use of a ratio that makes use of the simple model, which was not done before. This use of simple model scores for the weights is not obvious apriori and we utilize this and show improvements. Further, we would like to clarify that classic distillation is not a reweighting scheme in the sense that it does not optimize a loss of the form $\\sum_i w_i f(x_i, y_i)$. Instead, it actually fits a simple model to a soft label as described above. Suppose the soft targets are obtained from a deep neural net, the soft label function of x will have exponentially many linear pieces in the depth of the network. Temperature scaling does not affect this complexity of the soft label function. One can fit to this if the simple model also permits that many linear pieces (or has sufficient complexity). But our method is just sample reweighting and does not attempt to fit a high dimensional complex function.\n\nRegarding the dichotomy in up-weighting easy and hard examples. Indeed, Bengio 2009 addresses such a dichotomy in that the ordering of such examples during training can achieve better learning outcomes. Typically, this ordering is done manually for their method. The key there is to compare easy versus hard examples; if we knew which examples were easy versus hard, it would be better to train on the easy examples first followed by the hard ones. However, we offer a weighting that says examples considered easy by the complex model and hard by the simple should be given priority through weighting (no ordering of samples) in training the simple model. The question of easy versus hard is considered for each example here (rather than to order examples) in that we care about the ratio of the hardness between the complex and simple model.   \n\nRegarding graded classifiers: Graded classifiers here generalize the work of Dhurandhar et al 2018 for Neural Networks to other models. In Step (3) of Algo 1, all $\\zeta$'s in the set I are weighted equally (as in previous work). However, the set I removes $\\zeta$'s that are not within \\gamma accuracy of the simple model. The ordering (based on delta-graded) is important in order to obtain information from models of progressive accuracy (that are not much worse than the accuracy of the simple model without reweighting). The delta is important so that the ordering holds true for a part of the domain with sufficient probability mass (delta). \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper369/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper369/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Leveraging Simple Model Predictions for Enhancing its Performance", "authors": ["Amit Dhurandhar", "Karthikeyan Shanmugam", "Ronny Luss"], "authorids": ["adhuran@us.ibm.com", "karthikeyan.shanmugam2@ibm.com", "rluss@us.ibm.com"], "keywords": ["simple models", "interpretability", "resource constraints"], "TL;DR": "Method to improve simple models performance given a (accurate) complex model.", "abstract": "There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations.

In the case of multi class datasets, we train separate regressors for each label and choose the label with the best soft score for a point on the test. The first scheme gave better results so we reported those in the paper and  wrote this was an equivalent model to distillation. We will change this and make clear what that means here.\n\nRegarding the related works: Thank you for pointing them out. We have cited and discuss them in the Section 2 of the revised paper, however we do not view them as baselines for our current work. [1] is about learning weights while training a model, where the weights are a tuned on a validation set with the goal of robustifying the model, which is a very different goal. There is no transfer between models, nor is there a goal to improve performance of the pretrained model. [2] distills information specifically from a neural network to a soft decision tree, where a soft decision tree is a new model class that they have derived, and again, fits only to soft labels. It is applicable only for this specific scenario. [3] distills information from one model to another model of equivalent complexity and fits to the first model's soft scores, again however there is no student model of inferior performance as in our framework. [3]'s use of a method the call Confidence-Weighted by Teacher Max is equivalent to confWeight (from Dhurandhar et al 2018) which we include in our experiments. [4] uses a Gaussian Process regression to estimate uncertainty in the soft scores, and then during student training using stochastic gradient descent, they use these uncertainty estimates to change the stepsize. This only works if SGD is used for training the simple model (not assumed in our work) and further we do not have access to uncertainty of the soft estimates of the complex model. They have a small set of strongly annotated labels over which the GP is trained to provide soft scores and its variance. This is then used by the student to learn weakly annotated data. It is a very different problem.

The idea is to take the predictions of a \"complex\" (high-capacity) model, and weight the loss in the simple model based on the ratio of complex to simple models' predictions. Intuitively, this seeks to focus on instances which the complex model can fit, but the unweighted simple model cannot. Experiments show the proposed method to have some benefits over existing approaches.\n\nThe application of importance-weighting to the \"model distillation\" problem is interesting, and the paper gives a reasonable intuition for why this approach might work. One general comment is that in contrasting their approach to a number of existing approaches, they note that several of them are typically employed with fairly complex simple models (e.g., neural networks). This may be true, but it was not clear that any of them require this to be the case. Surely they can also be used with simple models as ones you consider in the paper? In this case, I would've liked more elucidation as to why the proposed method can be expected to offer superior performance.\n\nThe theoretical justification of the approach is provided by means of Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, for which I have some comments:\n- Lemma 3.1: the notation here is a bit imprecise. In general, a loss for example (x, y) takes in a true label y and predicted score z(x). You refer to the loss of a probabilistic prediction p(y | x), but do not refer to the actual label y itself. From the proof, it is implicit that you are considering y to be binary, and the use of a margin loss. This is ok, but for the hinge loss one doesn't use a probability estimate p(y | x) as input to the loss, but rather, a real-valued score.\n\nI think the result itself could be proven by noting that if \u03c6 is non-increasing and q < p, then \u03c6(p)/\u03c6(q) <= 1 < p/q.\n\n- Lemma 3.2: the result is interesting, but it seems that for practical purposes you are only using the first term, since it is the only quantity that depends on \u03b8. Since max(1, .) >= 1 and -log p\u03b8(y | x) >= 0, it seems one could trivially bound the LHS by the first term since -log p\u03b8(y | x) <= max(1, .) * -log p\u03b8(y | x)? Would this not suffice for the purposes of justifying your method? It should also be noted here how the subsequent requirement that the weights be capped (so as to prevent outliers) fits into the analysis.\n\nIn describing the method itself, the authors introduce a notion of \u03b4-graded subsets. I found this to be a bit difficult to parse, and it was not clear why this notion was needed. It does not seem to feature in the description of Algorithm 1, nor the subsequent discussion. On the other hand, I felt that the meaning and need for parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 ought to have been discussed more prominently upfront.\n\nThe experiments show favourable performance of the proposed method over baselines, including the distillation approach of Hinton. The datasets are mostly small-scale, but this is in keeping with the goal of the paper, viz. addressing scenarios where simple models may be desired. Per earlier comments, I did not have a deep sense of what additional information the proposed method exploits so as to improve performance. I gather that the weighting including the predictions of the simple model is one difference; it might have been nice to give a sense of what fraction of points this amplifies or suppresses, compared to just using the predictions of the complex model.\n\nThere is a nice illustration in Fig 1 (right) as to the class-labels of the training samples assigned various weights. This shows that points with low weight tend to have low agreement with their neighbours' labels. One question is how using a nearest neighbour probability estimate itself (i.e., using this as the \"complex\" model) would fare.\n\nMinor comments:\n- the title is a bit confusing. It is not clear what \"its\" refers to. You are leveraging the predictions of a complex model to enhance those of a simple model?\n- the text has a number of long sentences that could benefit from rewriting or splitting.\n- proof of Lemma 3.2, use \\cdot not *.\n- proof of Lemma 3.2, \u03b8* should use superscript.\n- Fig 1, the caption is overlong. Most of this should be in the text.\n- Fig 1, use crisper fonts for the text."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper369/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper369/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Leveraging Simple Model Predictions for Enhancing its Performance", "authors": ["Amit Dhurandhar", "Karthikeyan Shanmugam", "Ronny Luss"], "authorids": ["adhuran@us.ibm.com", "karthikeyan.shanmugam2@ibm.com", "rluss@us.ibm.com"], "keywords": ["simple models", "interpretability", "resource constraints"], "TL;DR": "Method to improve simple models performance given a (accurate) complex model.", "abstract": "There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations.

The main difference to some existing approaches of this kind is the universal applicability to many complex-simple model combinations (and not only layered networks). Technically, this paper is an extension and formalization of some ideas proposed in (Dhurandhar 2018). The main methodological contribution is the formal justification of the proposed weighting scheme for samples which utilizes the ratio of conditional probabilities p_complex(y|x)/p_simple(y|x) in the Lemma 3.1 and 3.2. The practical algorithm described in the paper is based on the concept of delta-graded classifiers which basically defines a nested set of classifiers of increasing accuracy -- such as, for instance, simple classifiers trained on intermediate layers of a deep network. The second important input argument is the learning algorithm for the simple model, which is trained on the re-weighted samples. The motivation for this algorithmic procedure is somewhat \"hand-waving\", but rather intuitive. Experiments for different benchmark datasets and different complex-simple model combinations nicely demonstrate that this method is indeed quite useful in practice. In summary, I think that this work addresses a highly relevant problem and provides a relatively simple method that might be very useful in many applications. A potential weakness could be the gap between the formal treatment of the cross-entropy loss in Lemma 3.2. and the rather \"ad hoc\" practical algorithm that crucially depends on two tuning parameters. Nevertheless, in my opinion, this work provides some interesting ideas that have the potential to trigger future research in this area.

The approach is based on reweighting the train examples according to the ratio of confidences of the complex and simple models, and then retraining the simple model on the reweighed dataset. \n\nPros:\n* Some interesting ideas motivating the approach\n\nCons:\n* An important error in the main result and various other issues (imprecise statements, lack of details) raise doubts on the theoretical contribution of the paper.\n* Limited novelty. Contribution boils down to importance reweighting via a ratio of probabilities.\n* Limited awareness of related work.\n* Experimental framework lacks meaningful baselines and important details .\n\nBased on the points above, I have to recommend rejection of this paper to ICLR. \n\nDetailed Comments:\n* The claim that per-sample hardness reweighting is novel to this work is a bit of a stretch. Most reweighting-based methods for distillation use some form of this idea, though how each method estimates \u201chardness\u201d varies, ranging from raw confidence scores of the teacher model (e.g., classic distillation), to scaled versions of it, to a ratio of this and the student\u2019s score (this work).\n* More generally, there\u2019s quite a few very relevant related works which are not cited here (see list below for a non-exhaustive list).\n* I believe the inequality used to prove Lemma 3.2 is not true in general. It\u2019s easy to come up with counterexamples for which w>=1 and x>1 yet log(wx) <= w log(x) does not hold. For example, for w=2, any x in (1,2) will not satisfy this. In general, this inequality is only true if x >= w^{1/(w-1)}. I would be prepared to pass this off as a minor error, were it not for the fact that the w and x in the proof of Lemma 3.2 could quite conceivably be outside this range, i.e., rendering the inequality (and therefore the bound) invalid.\n* There are various other technical aspects of the paper that are either non-rigorous or lack details. For example, Lemma 3.1 requires more information. For which y does w>= hold? Is it just for the true class y*? The proof is equally obscure, and seems to use the same problematic inequality of Lemma 3.2 (for the cross-entropy loss). \n* The statement of Lemma 3.2 is confusing. The last sentence should read loss smaller than *that* of theta*. Also, I don\u2019t see the optimality of theta* being used anywhere. The statement could very well be phrased in terms of any two models, one of which has a lower loss than the other. \n* Assuming the complex \u201cteacher\u201d classifiers are very accurate (which is assumed several times throughout the paper), re-weighting training examples by max(1, p_c / p_theta) does not provide too much information beyond the ground truth labels. This is a core problem in knowledge distillation, already identified as early as Hinton et al (2015), and which is often alleviated by some form of temperature annealing or by operating on pre-softmax logits rather than final probabilities. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here, so I\u2019m quite puzzled by the \u201cintuitive justification\u201d provided in this work.\n* The discussion in the first paragraph of pg 4 is a well known dichotomy (namely, up-weighting easy or hard examples) in the distillation/boosting/instance-reweighting literature. This discussion would really benefit from awareness of previous work discussing this duality (e.g., (Bengio et al 2009; Ren et al 2019)\n* Where and how is the ordering of the \u201cgraded\u201d classifiers used? In step (3) of Algo 1 all \\zeta\u2019s seem to be weighted equally, so I\u2019m missing why the classifiers need to be delta-graded.\n* I find it quite surprising that in almost half of the datasets in Table 1, distillation yields the exact same performance as just training the Simple Model, and sometimes even degrades the performance. Section 4.1 points out that this is actually \u201can equivalent model to Distillation\u201d, but no further explanation is given, so it is hard to conjecture what might be the problem. Futhermore, as the authors point out in the introduction, Distillation alla Hinton 2015 usually assumes both teacher and student models are soft predictors (e.g., neural nets), but the models used in the UCI experiments trees and SVMs, so I wonder how exactly they did this. \n* For problems involving distillation into simple interpretable models (like trees), such as the UCI experiments, there are many reasonably strong baselines from previous work that could have been compared against (e.g. Frosst and Hinton 2017), which could have provided a more meaningful evaluation.\n\n\n[1] Learning to Reweight Examples for Robust Deep Learning, Ren et al.

Actually the first line in the abstract above itself motivates it. Simple models are required in many domains where SMEs are responsible for the decision and want to understand all aspects of the decision making as their jobs depend on it.
