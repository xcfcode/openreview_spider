We do believe that there is a lot to be improved in this paper!\n1)\tAbout the first concern of the reviewer, the reason of \u201cequated generalization\u201d is that previously upon the finish of this paper, there is no clear definition of the generalization in the adversarial settings. And our statement is actually saying that \u201cadversarial robust generalization\u201d  doesn\u2019t equal to \u201cstandard generalization\u201d, as in the NeurIPS\u201918 tutorial slides, https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NIPS2018/Slides/adversarial_ml_slides_parts_1_4.pdf, page 29-30. We can now give the formal definition maybe in the future paper, thanks for the advice.\n2)\tFor the second concern, by briefly comparing weight/input space visualization, the main conclusion we want to draw is that, past generalization analysis cannot be well adopted in the adversarial settings. I think this should make more sense.\n3)\tAbout the sec.3, we don\u2019t agree with the reviewer that the visualization insights are trivial because the visualization results are one of the key intuition, which is \u201cThe geometry slopes (gradients) matter a lot in the model\u2019s robustness\u201d and this is the motivation of why regulating jacobian could improve the robustness in the whole paper. \n4)\tAbout the robustness indicator, we have shown a case study in the Sec4.3 ROBUSTNESS INDICATOR EVALUATION. We could compare two model\u2019s Jacobian & Hessian to distinguish two model\u2019s robustness easily, as shown in Fig.8. This is not done by grid search, but by backpropagation to compute Jacobian and Hessian, therefore not computationally expensive. \n5)\tAbout the Jacobian Regulation novelty, we do agree that the robust training part is not a significant contribution, as also mentioned by reviewer-2. Our reply about the difference is here: https://openreview.net/forum?id=rylV6i09tX&noteId=HJgm8ciA3X under the reviewer-2\u2019s comments.\n6)\tAbout the related work and other minor comments, thanks again for the precious comments!\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpreting Adversarial Robustness: A View from Decision Surface in Input Space", "abstract": "One popular hypothesis of neural network generalization is that the flat local minima of loss surface in parameter space leads to good generalization.

About the first concern, we understand your concerns that the cross-entropy loss surface hole might be caused by drawing the plots too high to see that the gradients' direction. We will try to lower the magnitude of the loss surface and visualize it again.\nBut still, our point that decision loss is more informative here is not only about the gradient's direction,  but also the changing speed of the loss. And the example we give in the appendix shows, the cross-entropy loss will hardly change in high-confidence areas, which causes that it is not suitable for visualization in 2D and 3D cases, e.g. in Fig.12 (a). \n\n2.  In the original paper, our CIFAR10 results are obtained on a ConvNet (which we have given in the first version in Appendix Sec. 8.3).

You make an interesting argument that changes in the loss can be quite small when confidence increases.  However, it could be that small changes in the confidence are meaningful even though they're small.  I *still* want to see what in the blank holes in Figure 4.  I understand the the loss is small in this region, however the only reason there's a blank region is because of how you (arbitrarily) chose to draw the contours at too high a level to see what's going on.\n   You make an argument here that the decision surface is more informative because the gradient direction contains more information than the loss gradient.  However, I can't see the loss gradient in your figure because the contours start at too high a value, so I don't see how this figure backs up this hypothesis.\n\n4) My concern was that the original MinMax model is optimized for epsilon=8.  The method \"outs+advtrain\" in Table 2 out-performs MinMax for small epsilon.  However the table might turn if you compared against a MinMax optimized for smaller epsilon (in this case MinMax might beat the proposed method for epsilon=3).

The normalization is done by  following formula:   \\alpha = 0.01 * sign(\\alpha). (same as \\beta)\n\n2. About the blank area question, I think there might be some misunderstanding here.

By converting loss surfaces to decision surfaces (which denote the difference between the max and second highest logit), the authors show that all adversarial attack methods appear similar wrt the decision surface. This result is then related to the statistics of the input Jacobian and Hessian, which are shown to differ across adversarially sensitive and robust models. Finally, a regularization method based on regularizing the input Jacobian is proposed and evaluated. All of these results are shown through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10.\n\nIn general, the paper is clear, though there are a number of typos. With respect to novelty, some of the experiments are novel, but others, including the improved training method, have been explored before (see specific comments for references). Finally, regarding significance, many of the insights provided this paper are true by definition, and are therefore unlikely to have a significant impact. \n\nWhile I strongly believe that rigorous empirical studies of neural networks are essential, this paper is lacking in several key areas, including framing, experimental insights, and relation to prior work, and is therefore difficult to recommend. Please see the comments below for more detail. \n\nMajor comments:\n\n1) In the beginning of the paper, adversarial robustness and generalization are equated. However, adversarial robustness and generalization are not necessarily equivalent, and in fact, several papers have provided evidence against this notion, showing that adversarial inputs are likely to be present even for very good models [5, 6] and that adversarially sensitive models can often generalize quite well [2]. Moreover, all the experiments within the paper only address adversarial robustness rather than generalization to unperturbed samples.\n\n2) One of the main results of this paper is that the loss surface wrt input space is more sensitive to adversarial perturbations than the loss surface wrt parameter space. Because adversarial inputs are defined in input space, by definition, the loss surface wrt to the input must be sensitive to adversarial examples. This result therefore appears true by definition. Moreover, [3] related the input Jacobian to generalization, finding a similar result, but is not discussed or cited.\n\n3) The main result of Section 3 is that all adversarial attacks \u201cutilize the decision surface geometry properties to cross the decision boundary within least distance.\u201d While to my knowledge the decision surface visualization is novel and might have important uses, this statement is again true by definition, given that adversarial attack methods try to find the smallest perturbation which changes the network decision. As a result, all methods must find directions which are short paths in the decision surface. It is therefore unclear what additional insight this analysis presents. \n\n4) How does measuring the loss landscape as an indicator for adversarial robustness differ from simply trying to find adversarial examples as is common? If anything, it seems it should be more computationally expensive as points are sampled in a grid search vs optimized for. \n\n5) The proposed regularizer for adversarial robustness, based on regularizing the input Jacobian, is very similar to what was proposed in [1], yet [1] is not discussed or cited. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n1) The paper\u2019s first sentence states that \u201cIt is commonly believed that a neural network\u2019s generalization is correlated to ...the flatness of the local minima in parameter space.\u201d However, [4] showed several years ago that the local minima flatness can be arbitrarily rescaled and has been fairly influential. While [4] is cited in the paper, it is only cited in the related work section as support for the statement that local minima flatness is related to generalization when this is precisely opposite the point this paper makes. [4] should be discussed in more detail, both in the introduction and the related work section.\n\n2) The paper is quite lengthy, going right up against the hard 10 page limit. While this may be acceptable for papers with large figures or which require the extra space, this paper does not currently meet that threshold. \n\n3) Throughout the figures, axes should be labeled. \n\n4) In section 2.2, it is stated that both networks achieve optimal accuracy of ~90% on CIFAR-10. This is not optimal accuracy and hasn\u2019t been for several years [7].\n\n5) Why is equation 2 calculated with respect to the logit layer vs the normalized softmax layer? Using the unnormalized logits may introduce noise due to scaling.\n\n6) In Figure 8, the scales of the Hessian are extremely different. Does this impact the measurement of sparseness? \n\n\nTypos:\n\n1) Introduction, second paragraph: \u201cFor example, ResNet model usually converges to\u2026\u201d should be \u201cFor example, ResNet models usually converge to\u2026\u201d\n\n2) Introduction, second paragraph: \u201c...defected by the adversarial noises...\u201d should be \u201c...defected by adversarial noise\u2026\u201d\n\n3) Introduction, third paragraph: \u201c...introduced by adversarial noises...\u201d should be \u201c...introduced by adversarial noise\u2026\u201d\n\n4) Section 3.1, first paragraph: \u201ccross entropy based loss surface is\u2026\u201d should be \u201ccross entropy based loss surfaces is\u2026\u201d\n\n[1] Jakubovitz, Daniel, and Raja Giryes. \"Improving DNN Robustness to Adversarial Attacks using Jacobian Regularization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.08680 (2018).

Our paper mainly has following contributions about adversarial examples and adversarial robustness (In case that you are not familiar with adversarial examples, please refer to [1-3] for some preliminary knowledge.):\n\n1.    By visualizing different adversarial attacks\u2019 trajectories in Fig.4, We show the nature of adversarial examples, which are NOT really \u201cgenerated\u201d by adversarial attacks but are \u201cnaturally existed\u201d examples which are wrongly classified by the neural network. Therefore, we summarize the adversarial examples phenomenon as the neural network\u2019s \u201cneighborhood underfitting\u201d issues, instead of an \u201cattack\u201d problem. Meanwhile, different adversarial attacks share the same mechanism which is to find the shortest paths to cross the decision boundaries and enter the wrong classification region of neural networks as shown in Fig.4. \n\n2.    With regard to adversarial robustness, our work shows in adversarial settings, the neural network\u2019s parameter space geometry has no close relationship to its robustness, as shown in Fig.1, 2, 3. By contrast, the neural network\u2019s input space geometry can clearly indicate a model\u2019s robustness: wide and flat plateau with gentle slopes usually indicates better model robustness, as shown in Fig.6, 7.\n\n3.    We also mathematically prove 2\u2019s conclusion by second-order Taylor Approximation and Jacobian & Hessian\u2019s differential geometry properties, that is, the lower magnitude of Jacobian and Hessian Eigenvalues of the network (w.r.t the input) indicates smoother input space geometry, as well as better robustness. \n\n4.    Based on 3\u2019s conclusion, we therefore propose a robust training by regulating the L2 norm of Jacobian (since smaller Jacobian leads to better robustness). And the experiments compare our robustness training performance with other state-of-the-art robustness enhancement methods.\n\nThanks again for your interests in our paper.

MinMax is commonly known that this method cannot generalize to large-scale datasets [2], e.g. ImageNet, since every training step in MinMax needs to generate PGD adversarial examples through 10-30 backpropagations. This makes training large-scale MinMax robust models impractical. But our method has better scaling ability than MinMax, the time consumption by double-backpropagation per training step is about 2.1 times than normal training, which is thus 5-15 times less than MinMax. \nb)\tMeanwhile, on CIFAR10, the gap between MinMax and our method is not that large. Especially, the robustness gap under eps=3 attacks (FGSM, BIM, C&W) is negligible as shown in Table.2.  And about the robustness degradation under larger step attack, our reason analysis is stated in Sec 5.2, that because Taylor Approximation performs well in a small neighborhood but has limitations against larger step attack, which is a limitation of our method which we also talked in the paper.  \n\n6)\tLastly, as our paper named \"Interpreting Adversarial Robustness: A View from Decision Surface in Input Space\", we sincerely hope that reviewer could also take our paper\u2019s other contributions into consideration, like revealing the nature of adversarial examples and robustness are actually solving NN\u2019s neighborhood underfitting issue, the shared mechanism of various adversarial attacks by decision loss surface visualization and interpretation, proof of the relationship between loss geometry and adversarial robustness by Jacobian and Hessian\u2019s geometry properties, etc., and we believe our paper is a thorough analysis and interpretation work in current interpreting adversarial attack and robustness research. \n\nAgain, we thank the reviewer for the detailed reviews!\n\n[1] Andrew Slavin Ross and Finale Doshi-Velez.

We have provided the natural model and robust MinMax model\u2019s contour maps on natural input and adversarial inputs and their Visualizations in the Appendix (the updated version) 8.5, Fig.16.\n\nAs expected, in parameter space, natural model's loss surface on adversarial inputs has a larger base height than the robust model, i.e. the average loss values are higher than robust models. But such gap is only obvious on weak attacks, like FGSM. When we use stronger attacks like C\\&W attack, the loss surface of the natural model and robust model become similar again: Both models' surfaces demonstrate high cross-entropy loss with no obvious distinction.\n\nTherefore, as mentioned in the review, we can indeed use the loss surface in weight space to show their robustness difference if they are both plotted with weak adversarial inputs. But when we are facing stronger iterative attacks, the loss surface in weight space can no longer show any difference, thus cannot indicate the model robustness. \n\nBy contrast, our input space loss surfaces can explicitly show the model robustness difference with no such restrictions, and the robustness difference can also be more obviously demonstrated, as shown in main paper Fig.3. Therefore, we think this is the advantage of using input space loss surface to indicate the model robustness. We will absolutely update the statement in the main paper. \n\n2.\tIn Fig.3, both x-axes (alpha) in (a) and (b) are chosen as random directions with normalization, and both y-axes (beta) are chosen as FGSM attack direction [1].  \nIn Fig.4, all x-axes (alpha) in (a)-(d) are chosen as random directions with normalization, and y-axes are as following (formulas in Eq.3): (a) random direction, (b) FGSM attack direction [1], (c) Least-likely class attack direction [1], (d) C&W attack direction [2], all with normalization.\n\n3.\tThe gradients and random noises are normalized as in Fast gradient sign method [1], which is the pixel-wise sign, i.e. beta = sign(beta).\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the constructive comments on the first point, and we will absolutely update the statement to be more accurate. \n\n[1] Adversarial examples in the physical world, Alexey Kurakin et al, 2016.\n[2] Towards evaluating the robustness of neural networks.

The \u201cless informative\u201d blank region is caused by the non-linear operations (soft-max and entropy). Specifically, when a neural network has high confidence in correct logits, the cross-entropy could hardly describe the confidence information: \nFor example, ten-class model with nine pairs of different logit outputs [1, 1, 1, \u2026, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1, \u2026, 1, 1], \u2026. [9, 1, 1, \u2026, 1, 1];\nThe corresponding cross-entropy loss is [2.30, 1.46, 0.79, 0.37, 0.15, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01];\nThe corresponding confidence defined in Eq.2 is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];\nWith further increasing of logits confidence (model confidence could easily achieve over 20 in common NN models), the cross-entropy loss hardly changes anymore. But the confidence\u2019s change is stable. That\u2019s why the blank region appears in cross-entropy loss surface but not in decision surface. Therefore, we state the decision confidence surfaces could provide more geometry information in the \u201cblank region\u201d of cross-entropy loss surface. \nb)\tSecond, the decision boundary loss surface contains the explicit decision boundary (contour line L=0), across which the model\u2019s prediction result will be flipped. By contrast, cross-entropy loss surface has no such explicit decision boundary. This is one very important property since this enables us to visualize and evaluate the attack strength needed to conduct a successful adversarial attack against the model.\nTherefore with these two points, we claim that decision surface is more informative than cross-entropy loss surface.\n\n2)\tAbout how to distinguish our work from Ross & Doshi [1], the same part is we use the same Loss_ce + Loss_grad idea but different regularizer design in Loss_grad. We choose to penalize decision boundary loss\u2019s (in Eq.2) gradients while Ross & Doshi use common cross-entropy loss\u2019s gradients. The benefit of doing so is related to the problem we mentioned in above part 1(a). Because of the cross-entropy loss involves highly non-linear soft-max and entropy operation compared to the decision loss, the changing of cross-entropy loss is negligible in high confidence cases (as we mentioned before) but decision loss has no such drawbacks. The non-linear operations will also cause the gradient of cross-entropy loss is relatively small, which brings constraints on the gradient penalty effect. As the comparison experiments in Table1 and 2 showed, our decision loss gradient regularizer outperforms cross-entropy loss regularization a lot on both MNIST and CIFAR10. \n\n3)\tAbout the 3rd and 4th concerns, the reason we omit the MinMax model on MNIST is purely space consideration. Here we comment with the missing part our Ours+Adv Training, and MinMax\u2019s experimental results. We will update our version added with these MNIST experimental results.\n\nAttack | Natural   ----FGSM----              ----BIM----              ----C&W----\nEpsilon\t|    0      |0.1|0.2|0.3|           0.1|0.2|0.3|           0.1|0.2|0.3\nOurs+Adv|  95.9 | 87.6|72.2|44.1|   89.2|67.2|28.4|   89.6|73.2|39.5\nMinMax\t|  98.4   |97.3|96.3|95.2|   97.2|94.3|92.8|    97.6|96.4|94.5\n\nThe MinMax model is absolutely the most robust model, which is the reason why we choose its model to analyze the decision surface geometry. In Fig.6, the (eps < 0.3) region of MinMax model\u2019s decision surface is nearly flat with no downhills under both random noises and adversarial attacks, which makes it near immune to adversarial attacks. \n\n4)\tAnd about the final concern that on CIFAR10, will original MinMax released model be dominant in small perturbation attacks, below we show the original released model\u2019s (trained with eps=8) performance under the attacks:\n\nAttack\tNatural\t        ----FGSM----                       ----BIM-----\t                           ---C&W---\nEpsilon\t0\t               | 3| 6|8|9|\t                    |3|6|8|9|\t                          |3|6|8|9|\nAcc\t       87.3\t          |75.3|63.2|56.1|53.4|     |74.2|59.3|48.7|46.2|     |74.2|\t59.2|49.8|46.1|\n\nThe released original model did not show dominant accuracies on small perturbations above our methods on CIFAR10. The robustness gap is within 10% robustness excluding the model baseline accuracy difference (baseline accuracy difference is about 4% compared to Ours+AdvTrain).  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpreting Adversarial Robustness: A View from Decision Surface in Input Space", "abstract": "One popular hypothesis of neural network generalization is that the flat local minima of loss surface in parameter space leads to good generalization.

By analyzing the geometric properties of the loss surface in both parameter space and input space, they find input space is more appropriate in evaluating the generalization and adversarial robustness of a neural network. Therefore, they extend the loss surface to decision surface. They further visualized the adversarial attack trajectory on decision surfaces in input space, and formalized the adversarial robustness indicator. Finally, a robust training method guided by the indicator is proposed to smooth the decision surface.\n\nThis paper is interesting and well organized. The idea of plotting loss surface in input space seems to be a natural extension of the loss surface w.r.t to weight change. The loss surface in input space measures the network\u2019s robustness to the perturbation of inputs, which naturally shows the influence of adversarial examples and is suitable for studying the robustness to adversarial examples. \n\nNote that loss surface in parameter space measures the network\u2019s robustness to the perturbation of the weights with given inputs, which implicitly assumes the data distribution is not significantly changed so that the loss surface may have similar geometry on the unseen data.  \n\nThe claim of \u201cthese significant distinctions indicate the ineffectiveness of generalization estimation from the loss surfaces in parameter space\u201d are not well supported as the comparison between Figure 2(a) and Figure 3 seems to be unfair and misleading. Fig 2 are plotted based on input data without any adversarial examples. So it is expected to see that Fig 2(a) and Fig 2(b) have similar contours. However, the loss surface in weight space may still be able to show their difference if the they are both plotted with the adversarial inputs. I believe that models trained by Min-Max robust training will be more stable in comparison with the normally trained models. It would be great if the author provide such plots. I would expect the normal model to have a high and flat surface while the robust model shows reasonable loss with small changes in weight space.\n\nHow to choose \\alpha and \\beta for loss surface of input space for Fig 3 and Fig 4 (first row)?\n\nHow are \\alpha and \\beta normalized for loss surface visualization in weight space as in Eq 1?\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper794/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interpreting Adversarial Robustness: A View from Decision Surface in Input Space", "abstract": "One popular hypothesis of neural network generalization is that the flat local minima of loss surface in parameter space leads to good generalization.

The authors also propose a gradient-based regularizer to improve robustness during training.\n\nSome things I liked about this paper:\nThe authors are the first to visualize the \"decision boundary loss\".  I also find this to be a better and more thorough study of loss functions than I have seen in other papers.  The quality of the visualizations is notably higher than I've seen elsewhere on this subject.\n\nI have a few criticisms of this paper that I list below:\n1)  I'm not convinced that the decision surface is more informative than the loss surface.  There is indeed a big \"hole\" in the middle of the plots in Figure 4, but it seems like that is only because the first contour is drawn at too high a level to see what is going on below.  More contours are needed to see what is going on in that central region. \n2) The proposed regularizer is very similar to the method of Ross & Doshi.  It would be good if this similarity was addressed more directly in the paper.  It feels like it's been brushed under the rug.\n3) In the MNIST results in Table 1:  These results are much less extensive than the results for CIFAR.  It would especially be nice to see the MinMax results since those of commonly considered to be the state of the art. The fact that they are omitted makes it feel like something is being hidden from the reader.\n4) The results of the proposed regularization method aren't super strong.  For CIFAR, the proposed method combined with adversarial training beats MinMax only for small perturbations of size 3, and does worse for larger perturbations.  The original MinMax model is optimized for a perturbation of size 8.  I wonder if a MinMax result with smaller epsilon would be dominant in the regime of small perturbations.
