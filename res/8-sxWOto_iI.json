This is done for both classification and regression setups. It is shown that the model performance can be sometimes improved by choosing particular training subsets and hyperparameters depending on the robustness distribution of the test (sub)sets.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n\n-\tThe problem studied is interesting and is very relevant from a practical point of view.\n-\tThe paper is structured well, and the problem has been motivated well in the introduction.\n-\tThe related work and experiment results sections are quite thorough, and the empirical results are interesting.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n\n-\tMy main concern is that the definition of the sample robustness (in Section 3) seems overtly simplistic and ad-hoc. I understand the underlying reasoning behind the choice, but one could also consider many other definitions. It would have been more satisfactory had some supporting theoretical results been provided for the proposed notion.\n-\tThe grammar and quality of writing can be improved at many places.\n-\tIn Table 3, it seems that training on the complete training set gives the best loss/accuracy when tested on the complete test set (compared to when we train on subsets of the data). But then, what is the benefit here of training on a (least/most robust) subset of the training data? No explanation is provided in this regard.\n-\tIn Table 4 as well, downsizing x drastically increases the loss on the complete test t. However, in Table 6 (KNN), choosing the 40,000 most robust training samples gives the best accuracy on t. There is no explanation provided as to why this is the case.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFurther remarks:\n\n-\tIn Section 4.2: 50.000 --> 50,000 (same for 10.000).\n-\tIt will be helpful for the reader if Algorithm 2 were in the main text.\n-\tIn the experiments, it is not clear to me why the least and most robust test subsets are considered. In practice, we do not have access to the test data so we cannot process it.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------\nPost rebuttal:\nI have read the authors response and appreciate the effort made to improve the paper. But I think the results still need additional work, especially from the theoretical front.

To this end, we have added additional theory in the updated version, which we furthermore used to explain the experimental data. Moreover, we changed the wording of our contribution to make it match with our present work.\n\n2. As this work was intended to be an introduction, we only used the minimal setup of two different datasets to cover a classification- and regression setup. We intended to motivate readers to investigate the proposed concept in the future. However, as other reviews mentioned as well, the lack of additional theory caused our work to solely rely on this empirical data. Therefore, by adding such theory in the updated version, we hope to give a more convincing introduction.\n\n3. Indeed, our work emphasised reporting of effects, rather than explaining them in the first place. In the updated version, we discuss the theoretic motivation of training on more- or less robust samples (in particular for KNN).

We are delighted to read that our work sparked interest in the proposed concept.\n\nAs to the cons, we will comment in the given order:\n\n1. As mentioned by other reviewers as well, our work lacks the theoretic motivation for the proposed concept of sample robustness. Furthermore, it seemed overly simplistic and may not convince a reader (there may be many equivalent choices). Indeed, sample robustness is merely a normalised point-wise Lipschitz constant of the label map. However, this is exactly what we intended to create in the first place, i.e. an accessible measure of data-robustness that only depends on the data itself. To give it a more theoretical basis, we have added a corresponding section in the updated version explaining our original motivation behind it. Furthermore, we have worked out the particular relationships of our concept to KNN models.\n\n2. We did rewrite almost all paragraphs to enable a better reading flow.\n\n3. The best performance on the whole test set ist achieved using the whole training set. The critical insight here, however, is that for the least- and most robust subsets of the test data, the model can achieve better performances (compared to the baseline) by using only 80% of the training set. It shows, for example, that such a model can generalise better on less robust data when trained on such data. One can therefore benefit from a collection of expert-models, each trained on a subset of different robustness.\n\n4. Table. 4 indicates that there exists a model-dependent trade-off between (i) aligning robustness distributions by downsizing the training data and (ii) the overall ability of a model to generalise from the smaller set of samples. For KNN, we have provided additional theoretic relations and an explanation of precisely these results in the updated version. We attribute the outcome to the elimination of natural adversarial examples.\n\n\nFurther remarks:\n- We used the correct writing now.\n- The algorithms are moved to the appendix as they build on additional theoretic results (also noted in the appendix).\n- We did use the most- and least robust subsets to amplify any noticeable effect. \n\nAgain, we want to express our gratitude towards reviewer 1 for the provided criticism and remarks.

They do so by taking the pointwise Lipschitz constant of the label map and normalizing it by the label norm. The authors show that training on samples that are / are not sensitive helps on a test set that is / is not sensitive. \n\nPositives:\n\nThe authors do extensive experimentation to evaluate the effect of training with various data subsets constructed by taking the most or least sensitive samples, and testing on other subsets of sensitive / not sensitive samples.\n\nThe results generally show that performance on non-sensitive subsets improves when training with non-sensitive data.\n\nNegatives:\n\nI'm not terribly convinced by the experimental results. It seems like the conclusion of the paper is that if the goal is to get good performance on the standard test set, you should just use the original data without taking into account sample robustness.\n\nThere are gains for specific subsets, but the paper doesn't really do a good job of convincing me why I should care about this. It seems like the end goal should be performance on whatever test set I originally collected, and not a subset where you remove particular hard or easy examples. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that the train and test data selection procedures are matched (i.e. you select points based on sample robustness and evaluate on similar selection criteria). \n\nFinally, I'm not sure if this notion of sample robustness is conceptually novel compared to methods like adversarial pruning (Yang 2019). The authors could have done more in linking the effects of sample robustness to the margin or generalization properties of the resulting classifier. For an example of such discussion see the recent line of work on r-consistency and nonparametric methods for adversarial robustness.\n\nFinally, the writing style is generally convoluted and requires substantial effort to parse. The abstract sentence starting with \"In this work\" and first sentence of the intro are both examples of this. The problem is too pervasive for me to give exhaustive pointers, but the paper requires substantial copyediting before it is accepted or published.\n\nMinor / trivial: \n\nAbstract - \"In this work ...\" has way too many commas.\nPlease use proper left quotes for Latex.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1106/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1106/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Introducing Sample Robustness", "authorids": ["~Monty_Maximilian_Z\u00fchlke1"], "authors": ["Monty Maximilian Z\u00fchlke"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Choosing the right data and model for a pre-defined task is one of the critical competencies in machine learning.

The authors claim that they introduce a concept of sample robustness based on the Lipschitz constant of the label map. The authors then empirically evaluate the robustness distribution of two datasets and investigate the model performance when using training subsets from different parts of the robustness distribution.\n\nPros:\n- The idea of robustness distribution for a dataset seems interesting. It might be used to compare different datasets.\n- The authors provide extensive experiments using different models. It is nice to see the details for each model and the robust samples for each dataset.\n\nCons:\n- The novelty of this work is somewhat limited. The notion of sample robustness that the authors propose is just a minor modification of Lipschitz constant. Moreover, there is no theoretical or empirical justification regarding why this definition of sample robustness is useful.\n\n- Despite that I really appreciate the efforts that the authors have put on the experimental section, I think that the contribution to the community is somewhat weak. This paper just uses the so called sample robustness to select a subset of the training sample and then reports the performance of model trained with that subset on some test data. But the authors do not provide any insights on how it works. In fact, from the results, it is still not clear how sample robustness can help choose the right training set and improve the model performance. \n\n- There are some typos.

The motivation is straight forward and the proposed concept of sample robustness is inspiring. However, the works in this paper do not match with the announced contribution. Hence, I vote to reject.\n\nReasons for scores:\n1\uff0cthis paper announces that the novel concept of sample robustness can be used to choose training subsets and boost the model performance. In addition, some simple theoretical analysis about sample robustness are also given. But, this paper just gives some simple results of theoretical analysis and have no any explanation about those analytical results. More significantly, those analysis have little relationship with the goal of this paper. So this paper lacks some key theoretical analysis about sample robustness for its advantages.\n\n2\uff0cThe main works of this paper is based on empirical studies. Because of the lack of necessary theoretical analysis, more datasets are needed for verifying the behavior of model based on the concept of sample robustness. However, the datasets in this paper are too few to guarantee the good behavior of proposed technique in orther datasets.\n\n3\uff0cthis paper does not analyze the pros and cons of proposed technique based on the concept of sample robustness.\n\n4\uff0cSome irregular use of mathematical symbols and grammatical errors.\n\nOverall, the works in this paper do not support the announced contribution\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1106/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1106/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Introducing Sample Robustness", "authorids": ["~Monty_Maximilian_Z\u00fchlke1"], "authors": ["Monty Maximilian Z\u00fchlke"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Choosing the right data and model for a pre-defined task is one of the critical competencies in machine learning.
