I liked the use of sparsity- and group-sparsity-promoting regularizers to select connections and decide how to expand the network.\n\nA strength of the paper is that the proposed algorithm is interesting and intuitive, even if relatively complex, as it requires chaining a sequence of sub-algorithms. It was good to see the impact of each sub-algorithm studied separately (to some degree) in the experimental section. The results are overall strong.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to judge the novelty of the approach though, as I\u2019m not an expert on this topic.\n\nJust a few points below:\n- The experiments focus on a relevant continual learning problem, where each new task corresponds to learning a new class. In this setup, the method consistently outperforms EWC (e.g., Fig. 3), as well as the progressive network baseline.\nDid the authors also check the performance on the permuted MNIST benchmark, as studied by Kirkpatrick et al. and Zenke et al.? It would be important to see how the method fares in this setting, where the tasks are the same, but the inputs have to be remapped, and network expansion is less of an issue.\n\n- Fig. 4 would be clearer if the authors showed also the performance and how much the selected connection subsets would change if instead of using the last layer lasso + BFS, the full L1-penalized problem was solved, while keeping the rest of the pipeline intact.\n\n- Still regarding the proposed selective retraining, the special role played by the last hidden layer seems slightly arbitrary. It may well be that it has the highest task-specificity, though this is not trivial to me. This special role might become problematic when dealing with deeper networks.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lifelong Learning with Dynamically Expandable Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel deep network architecture for lifelong learning which we refer to as Dynamically Expandable Network (DEN), that can dynamically decide its network capacity as it trains on a sequence of tasks, to learn a compact overlapping knowledge sharing structure among tasks.

One question would be how sparse training is done, and how this saves computation, especially with the breadth-first search described on page 5. \n\nA. Sparse training is done at both initial network training (Eq. (2)) and selective retraining step (Eq. (3)), using L1 regularizer. First, the initial network training obtains a network with sparse connectivity between neurons at consecutive layers. \n\nThen, the selective retraining selects the neurons at the layer just before the output neurons of this sparse network, and then using the topmost layer neurons as starting vertices, it selects neurons at each layer that have connections to the selected upper-layer neurons (See the leftmost model illustration of Figure 2). \n\nThis results in obtaining a subnetwork of the original network that has much less number of parameters (Figure 4.(b)) that can be trained with significantly less training time (Figure 4.(a)). The selected subnetwork also obtains substantially higher accuracy since it leverages only the relevant parts of the network for the given task (Figure 4.(a)).\n\nQ2. A critique would be that the base networks (a two layer FF net and LeNet) are not very compelling.\n\nA. To show that our algorithm obtains performance improvements on any generic networks, we experimented with a larger network that consists of 8 layers, which is a slight modification of AlexNet. With this larger network, our algorithm achieved similar performance gain over the baseline models as in the original experiments.

Did the authors also check the performance on the permuted MNIST benchmark, as studied by Kirkpatrick et al. and Zenke et al.? It would be important to see how the method fares in this setting, where the tasks are the same, but the inputs have to be remapped, and network expansion is less of an issue.\n\nA.  Following your suggestion, we have also experimented on the permuted MNIST dataset using feedforward network with 2 hidden layers and included the results in the Appendix section (See Figure 6). As expected, DEN achieves performance comparable to batch models such as STL or MTL, significantly outperforming both DNN-EWC and DNN-Progressive while obtaining a network that has significantly less number of parameters.  \n\nQ2. Fig. 4 would be clearer if the authors showed also the performance and how much the selected connection subsets would change if instead of using the last layer lasso + BFS, the full L1-penalized problem was solved, while keeping the rest of the pipeline intact.\n\nA.   The suggested comparative study is already done in Fig. 4. DNN-L1 shows the results using the full L1-penalized regularizer instead of the last layer lasso + BFS. This result shows that selective retraining is indeed useful in reducing time complexity of training and perform selective knowledge transfer to obtain better accuracy.  \n\n     For better understanding of the BFS process, we updated the figure that illustrates the selective retraining process to include arrows (Leftmost figure of Figure 2).\n \nQ3. Still regarding the proposed selective retraining, the special role played by the last hidden layer seems slightly arbitrary. It may well be that it has the highest task-specificity, though this is not trivial to me. This special role might become problematic when dealing with deeper networks.\n\nA. The last hidden layer is not the only layer that is learned to be task-specific, as the BFS process selects units that are useful for the given task at all layers of the network and retrains them. \n\n     To show that selective retraining does not become problematic with deeper networks, we performed additional experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset with a 8-layer network which is a slight modification of AlexNet. The results show that DEN obtains similar performance gain over baselines even with this deeper network. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lifelong Learning with Dynamically Expandable Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel deep network architecture for lifelong learning which we refer to as Dynamically Expandable Network (DEN), that can dynamically decide its network capacity as it trains on a sequence of tasks, to learn a compact overlapping knowledge sharing structure among tasks.
