Regularization by sparsity is a neat idea, but similar idea has been discussed by many pruning papers. \"model pruning formulation for neural architecture search based on sparse optimization\" is claimed to be the main contribution, but it's debatable if such contribution is strong: worse accuracy, more computation, more #parameters than Mnas (less search time, but also worse search quality). The effect of each proposed technique is appropriately evaluated. However, the reviewers are concerned that the proposed method does not outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. There's also some concerns about the search space of the proposed method. It is debatable about claim that \"the first NAS algorithm to perform direct search on ImageNet\" and \"the first method to perform direct search without block structure sharing\".

MobileNet can easily run below 100ms on a 3 year old Android phone.\n\nMobileNet+TF-Lite+Android is a well-established measurement setup for fair comparisons. MobileNet is also designed for mobile platform. The authors are encouraged to perform apple to apple comparison. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Area_Chair1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single Shot Neural Architecture Search Via Direct Sparse Optimization", "abstract": "Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space.

However, DSO-NAS indeed outperforms DARTS on ImageNet dataset as illustrated in Table2.\n\nQ4: \u201cFrom figure 2 it's not clear why all non-zero connections in (b) are then equally weighted in (c). Would keeping the non-zero weightings be at all helpful?\u201d\nA4: In the search stage, the scaling factors are only used to indicate which operators should be pruned. The value of scaling factors do not represent the importances of kept operators since they can be merged into the weights of convolution.\nWe also add experiments in CIFAR-10 to compare the performance between keeping the non-zero weightings and equal weightings. The result shows that both of them yield similar performances.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArchitecture         \t                    params(M)                   \ttest error\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-NAS-share+c/o                          3.0                        \t2.84\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-NAS-share+c/o+k/w                  3.0                              2.88\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-NAS-full+c/o                              3.0                        \t2.95\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-NAS-full+c/o+k/w                      3.0                        \t2.96\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwhere \u201cc/o\u201d represents that training the searched architectures with cutout and \u201ck/w\u201d represents keeping the non-zero weightings in the architectures.\n\nQ5: \u201cWhy have you chosen the 4 operations at the bottom of page 4?\u201d\nA5: These four operations were used by ENAS and commonly included in the search space of most NAS papers. \n\nQ6: \u201cHow do you specifically encode the number of surviving connections?\u201d\nA6: We don\u2019t directly encode the number of surviving connections.

We address your concerns as follows:\n\nQ1. \u201cThe search space of the proposed method, such as the number of operations in the convolution block, is limited.\u201d\nA1: First, the size of search space is not determined by the number of operations but the number of connections. The search space of our method is different from exiting NAS methods in that the number of input of certain operation is not limited.\n\nSecond, the search space without block share is even much larger than existing NAS methods. \n\nThird, we can trivially extend our DSO-NAS to accommodate more operations such as dilated conv like our ongoing experiments on PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation task, we extend our search space to accommodate 3x3 and 5x5 separable convolution with dilated = 2. The following table shows the performance of our model on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation task, where DSO-NAS-cls represents the architecture searched on ImageNet with block structure sharing and DSO-NAS-seg represents the architecture searched on PASCAL VOC segmentation task.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArchitecture                                         mIOU                     Params(M)                     FLOPS(B)    \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-NAS-cls                                            72.1                            6.5                               13.0\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-NAS-seg(more operations)         72.7                            6.7                               13.2\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe combine DSO-NAS with Deeplab v3 and search for the architecture of feature extractor with block sharing. All above models have been pre-trained on ImageNet classification task first. It\u2019s notable that the architecture searched on semantic segmentation task with additional operations achieve better performance in our preliminary experiment, indicating that our DSO-NAS is capable to incorporate additional operations. We will present the full experiments of semantic segmentation in the future revision.\n\nQ2: \u201cThe technical contribution of the proposed method is not high, because the architecture space of neural network is similar to the prior works.\u201d\nA2: Please refer to Q1. Moreover, we never claim the main contribution of our work lies in augmenting the search space. And in fact, most existing NAS papers share the same architecture search space, the main differences between them is the search strategy. We believe that judging the novelty of a NAS paper solely by its architecture space is unfair. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single Shot Neural Architecture Search Via Direct Sparse Optimization", "abstract": "Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space.

It helps us to prepare the revision. We address all your concerns in the revision as below. \n\nQ1: Was the auxiliary tower used during the training of the shared weights W?\nA1: Auxiliary tower is used only in the retraining stage.\n\nQ2: \u201cDid the experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet use the cosine learning rate schedule?\u201d\nA2: \nCIFAR: In the pretrain stage and search stage, the learning rate is fixed to 0.1 with batch size 128; In the retraining stage, we use cosine learning rate schedule.\nImageNet: In the pretrain stage and search stage, the learning rate is fixed to 0.1 with batch 224; In the retraining stage, we use linear decay learning rate schedule.\n\nQ3: \u201cFigure 4 does not illustrate M=4 and N=4, e.g. which operation belongs to which layer?\u201d\nA3: In the revision, we replace the Figure 4 with a new version which has more details. As show in Figure 4, all the operators in level 4 are pruned.\n\nQ4: \u201cThe sparse regularization of \\lambda induces great difficulties in optimization\u201d\nA4: The non-smooth regularization introduced by l1 regularization makes traditional stochastic SGD failed to yield sparse results. If we need exact zero, we have to use heuristic thresholding on the \\lambda learned, which has already been demonstrated in SSS [1] that is inferior. Besides, traditional APG method is not friendly for deep learning as extra forward-backward computation is required, also as shown by SSS.\n\nQ5: \u201cMissed citation: MnasNet also incorporates the cost of architectures in their search process. On ImageNet, your performance is similar to theirs. I think this will be a good comparison.\u201d\nA5: We have added the result of MnasNet [2] in Table 2. Indeed, MnasNet achieves similar results with us with less FLOPs. However, it is also need to note that MnasNet evaluates more than 8K models, which introduces much higher search cost than our method. Moreover, the design space of MnasNet is significant different from other existing NAS methods including ours. It is interesting to explore the combination of MnasNet with ours in the future work.\n\nQ6: \u201cThe paper has some grammatical errors.\u201d\nA6: We have fixed the typos and grammatical errors in the revision.\n\nQ7: About \u201cfirst NAS algorithm to perform direct search on ImageNet\u201d\nA7: We check this claim again and find methods like MnasNet [2] and one-shot architecture search [3] also have the ability to perform direct search on ImageNet, we have delete this claim in the paper. However, to the best of our knowledge, our method is the first method to perform directly search without block structure sharing. We also report preliminary results that directly search on task beyond classification (semantic segmentation).

You have indeed raised a very good point to NAS community.\n\nFirst, it should be noted that the latency of a model is highly dependent on the hardware platform and its corresponding implementation. For example, we test the latency of MobileNet and several state-of-the-art NAS methods, including MnasNet, DARTS, NasNet and our DSO-Nas in different hardware architectures and platforms. During testing, the batch-size is 1 and the input image size is 224 \u00d7 224. For GPU testing, a single NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti is used. The convolution library is CUDNN 7.0. For CPU testing, the test device is Intel i5-6600K CPU. Each network is randomly initialized and evaluated for 500 times. The average runtime is reported.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmodel                          mxnet(GPU)                       mxnet(CPU)                      TensorRT(GPU)     \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMobileNet                         1.94                                   194.18                                 1.01\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMnasNet                          2.85                                     62.32                                 1.71\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDARTS                            6.91                                     64.86                                     -\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNasNet                            9.32                                     92.12                                     -\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDSO-Nas                         7.00                                    149.53                                 4.25\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results test on GPU with MXNet shows that DARTS, NasNet and DSO-Nas have higher latency than MobileNet and MnasNet. This is because the network structures of DARTS, NasNet and DSO-Nas have more fragments than MobileNet and MnasNet due to the unlimited search space. The searched structure of block in DARTS, NasNet and DSO-Nas has a lot of small operators which will reduce degree of parallelism on GPU as shown in ShuffleNetV2 [1]. As for the CPU test results, we found that the latency of MobileNet is much higher, since the memory access is no longer the bottleneck. Compared within NAS method, our method is similar to DARTS, while better than NASNet in terms of accuracy.\n\nWhen using TensorRT, all the methods benefit from the deliberated implementation in GPU.\n\nThus, several important factors have considerable affection on latency, including network architectures, hardware architectures and platforms. For our DSO-NAS, we don\u2019t assume any target hardware platform, thus it is hard to directly optimize running latency. In one hand, we could optimize surrogate metric to latency such as MAC as illustrated in [1]; on the other hand, directly optimizing latency is on our schedule for future works as in the conclusion part. We may combine the spirit of MnasNet and our DSO-NAS in one unified framework, however it is out the scope of this single paper.\n\n[1] Ma, N., Zhang, X., Zheng, H.T. and Sun, J., 2018.

The existing NAS methods all start from empty block and then add operators. Our method conveys another totally novel view of NAS that is you can start from full view then prune the useless ones! And more importantly, we prove it works at least comparable or even better than previous approaches! Nobody before us ever think about NAS in this way.\n\nSecond, the design space is fundamentally different from model pruning. Pruning from such dense connected block requires deliberate design of the optimization and training scheme. That is why we design three stages training method for DSO-NAS. Moreover, while SSS focuses on pruning the neurons, groups or blocks, our method focuses on pruning the connections between different layers, namely structural connections. The optimization method is indeed from the ECCV paper, but we treat it as an existing, well-developed component to use, and does not declare it as our main contribution.\n\nAbove all, we think the justification of \"the same approach, solving the same problem, is submitted to two different communities\" are arbitrary and unsound."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single Shot Neural Architecture Search Via Direct Sparse Optimization", "abstract": "Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space.

All architectures in the search space thus share their weights, like ENAS (Pham et al 2018) and DARTS (Liu et al 2018a). The DAG\u2019s edges can be pruned via a sparsity regularization term. The optimization objective of DSO-NAS is thus:\n\nAccuracy + L2-regularization(W) + L1-sparsity(\\lambda),\n\nwhere W is the shared weights and \\lambda specifies which edges in the DAG are used.\n\nThere are 3 phases of optimization:\n1. All edges are activated and the shared weights W are trained using normal SGD. Note that this step does not involve \\lambda.\n2. \\lambda is trained using Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG, Huang and Wang 2018).\n3. The best architecture is selected and retrained from scratch.\n\nThis procedure works for all architectures and objectives. However, DSO-NAS further proposes to incorporate the computation expense of architectures into step (2) above, leading to their found architectures having fewer parameters and a smaller FLOP counts.\n\nTheir experiments confirm all the hypotheses (DSO-NAS can find architectures, having small FLOP counts, having good performances on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet).\n\nStrengths:\n1. Regularization by sparsity is a neat idea.\n\n2. The authors claim to be the first NAS algorithm to perform direct search on ImageNet. Honestly, I cannot confirm this claim (not sure if I have seen all NAS papers out there), but if it is the case, then it is impressive.\n\n3. Incorporating architecture costs into the search objective is nice. However, this contribution seems to be orthogonal to the sparsity regularization, which, I suppose, is the main point of the paper.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Some experimental details are missing. I\u2019m going to list them here:\n- Was the auxiliary tower used during the training of the shared weights W?\n\n- Figure 4 does not illustrate M=4 and N=4, e.g. which operation belongs to which layer?\n\n- Did the experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet use the cosine learning rate schedule [1]? If or if not, either way, you should specify it in a revised version of this paper, e.g. did you use the cosine schedule in the first 120 steps to train the shared parameters W, did you use it in the retraining from scratch?\n\n- In Section 3.3, it is written that \u201cThe sparse regularization of \\lambda induces great difficulties in optimization\u201d. This triggers my curiosity of which difficulty is it? It would be nice to see this point more elaborated, and to see ablation study experiments.\n\n2. Missed citation: MnasNet [2] also incorporates the cost of architectures in their search process. On ImageNet, your performance is similar to theirs. I think this will be a good comparison.\n\n3. The paper has some grammatical errors. I obviously missed many, but here are the one I found:\n\n- Section 3.3: \u201cDifferent from pruning, which the search space is usually quite limited\u201d. \u201cwhich\u201d should be \u201cwhose\u201d?\n\n- Section 4.4.1: \u201cDSO-NAS can also search architecture [...]\u201d  -> \u201cDSO-NAS can also search for architectures [...]\u201d\n\nReferences.\n[1] SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Warm Restarts. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03983.pdf\n\n[2] MnasNet: Platform-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11626.pdf\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single Shot Neural Architecture Search Via Direct Sparse Optimization", "abstract": "Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space.

Specifically, the proposed method introduces scaling factors to connections between operations, and impose sparse regularizations to prune useless connections in the network. The proposed method is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet dataset.\n\n- Pros\n  - The proposed method shows competitive or better performance than existing neural architecture search methods.\n  - The experiments are conducted thoroughly in the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The selection of the datasets is appropriate. Also, the selection of the methods to be compared is appropriate.\n  - The effect of each proposed technique is appropriately evaluated.\n\n- Cons\n  - The search space of the proposed method, such as the number of operations in the convolution block, is limited.\n  - The proposed method does not outperform the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.\n  - The technical contribution of the proposed method is not high, because the architecture space of neural network is similar to the prior works.\n\nOverall, if we focus on the balance between the classification accuracy and computational efficiency, the proposed method is promising.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1573/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Single Shot Neural Architecture Search Via Direct Sparse Optimization", "abstract": "Recently Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has aroused great interest in both academia and industry, however it remains challenging because of its huge and non-continuous search space.
