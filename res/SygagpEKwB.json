The reviewer's main concern appears to be \"This paper needs a substantial rewrite to make clear what specific contributions are from the multitude of experiments run in this study.\" We strongly disagree with this (non-constructive) concern and have linked in our rebuttal to the relevant section in the paper where such conclusions are explicitly stated. To illustrate this point, consider the ad-verbatim passages from the manuscript which directly refute the reviewer's concern:\n\nINTRODUCTION (bullet points): \n* \u201cWe observe that some of the existing disentanglement metrics (which require observations of z) can be used to tune the hyperparameters of unsupervised methods even when only very few labeled examples are available (Section 3). [...]\u201d.\n\n* \u201cWe find that adding a simple supervised loss, using as little as 100 labeled examples, outperforms unsupervised training with supervised model validation both in terms of disentanglement scores and downstream performance (Section 4.2)\u201d.\n\n* \u201cBoth unsupervised training with supervised validation and semi-supervised training are surprisingly robust to label noise (Sections 3.2 and 4.3) and tolerate coarse and partial annotations [...]\u201d.\n\n* \u201cBased on our findings we provide guidelines helpful for practitioners to leverage disentangled representations in practical scenarios.\u201d\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF SECTION 3.2: \n\u201cFrom this experiment, we conclude that it is possible to identify good runs and hyperparameter settings on the considered data sets using the MIG and the DCI Disentanglement based on 100 labeled examples. [...] Not observing all factors of variation does not have a dramatic impact. Whenever it is possible, it seems better to label more factors of variation in a coarser way rather than fewer factors more accurately.\u201d\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF SECTION 4.2 (SHOULD LABELS BE USED FOR TRAINING?): \n\u201cEven though our semi-supervised training does not directly optimize the disentanglement scores, it seem beneficial compared to unsupervised training with supervised selection. The more labels are available the larger the benefit. [...]\u201c\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF SECTION 4.3  (HOW ROBUST IS SEMI-SUPERVISED TRAINING TO IMPRECISE LABELS?): \n\u201cThese results show that the $S^2/S$ are also robust to imprecise labels. While the $U/S$ methods appear to be more robust, $S^2/S$ methods are still outperforming them.\u201d\n\nOVERALL CONCLUSIONS OF THE PAPER:\n\u201cIn this paper, we investigated whether a very small number of labels can be sufficient to reliably learn disentangled representations. We found that existing disentanglement metrics can in fact be used to perform model selection on models trained in a completely unsupervised fashion even when the number of labels is very small and the labels are noisy.  In addition, we showed that one can obtain even better results if one incorporates the labels into the learning process using a simple supervised regularizer. In particular, both unsupervised model selection and semi-supervised training are surprisingly robust to imprecise labels (inherent with human annotation) and partial labeling of factors of variation (in case not all factors can be labeled), meaning that these approaches are readily applicable in real-world machine learning systems. The findings of this paper provide practical guidelines for practitioners to develop such systems and, as we hope, will help advancing disentanglement research towards more practical data sets and tasks. \u201c\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling Factors of Variations Using Few Labels", "authors": ["Francesco Locatello", "Michael Tschannen", "Stefan Bauer", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Olivier Bachem"], "authorids": ["flocatello@tuebingen.mpg.de", "tschannen@google.com", "stefan.bauer@tuebingen.mpg.de", "raetsch@inf.ethz.ch", "bs@tuebingen.mpg.de", "bachem@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning.

This paper needs a substantial rewrite to make clear what specific contributions are from the multitude of experiments run in this study. As is, the two contributions stated in the introduction are both obvious and not particularly significant -- that having some labels of the type of disentanglement desired helps when used as a validation set and as a small number of labels for learning a disentangled representation space. There are no obviously stated conclusions about which types of labels are better than others (4.2). Section 3.2 seems to have some interesting findings that small scale supervision can help significantly and fine-grained labeling is not necessarily needed, but I don't understand why that finding is presented there when Fig. 4 seems to perform a similar experiment on types of labels with no conclusion based on its results. Conclusion sentence of 4.3 is hard to decipher, but I assume is just saying S^2/S beats U/S even when S^2/S is subject to noisy labels. Overall, I find it very difficult to absorb the huge amount of results and find the analysis not well presented.\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "N/A"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling Factors of Variations Using Few Labels", "authors": ["Francesco Locatello", "Michael Tschannen", "Stefan Bauer", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Olivier Bachem"], "authorids": ["flocatello@tuebingen.mpg.de", "tschannen@google.com", "stefan.bauer@tuebingen.mpg.de", "raetsch@inf.ethz.ch", "bs@tuebingen.mpg.de", "bachem@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning.

This investigation is motivated by recent results concluding that inductive biases are needed otherwise learning disentangled representations in an unsupervised fashion is impossible.  The paper poses its overall goal as making this injection of inductive biases explicit via a small number (~100 even) of (potentially noisy) labels, and reports on exhaustive experiments on four datasets.\n\nI think that this paper merits acceptance because (a) the motivation of taking a necessity in practice (somehow selecting models / injecting inductive biases) and making it more explicit in the approach is a good one, and because the thorough empirical survey (and simple, but novel, contribution of a new semi-supervised representation learning objective) are likely valuable contributions to this community.\n\nOne negative comment overall would be that the results are not that surprising: that is, the fact that using labels either (a) to do model validation or (b) in a semi-supervised fashion would help is not too surprising.  However, I believe in the context of (a) making more explicit a practical (and theoretically) necessary step in the pipeline of learning representations, and (b) contributing a comprehensive empirical study, this is a worthwhile contribution.\n\nMinor notes:\n- Fig. 1 isn't the most intuitive- ideally would be better explained for the headlining figure\n- 8.57 P100 GPU years is ~= $75k based on a cursory glance at cloud instance pricing at monthly rates... this is a lot to reproduce these experiments..."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling Factors of Variations Using Few Labels", "authors": ["Francesco Locatello", "Michael Tschannen", "Stefan Bauer", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Olivier Bachem"], "authorids": ["flocatello@tuebingen.mpg.de", "tschannen@google.com", "stefan.bauer@tuebingen.mpg.de", "raetsch@inf.ethz.ch", "bs@tuebingen.mpg.de", "bachem@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning.

Some are better with 100 labeled examples but don\u2019t scale as well as others when an order of magnitude more labeled data is available. It is certainly hard to discuss all the thousands of experimental observations, but the paper can benefit from some more fine-grained analysis.\n\nMinor\nFigure 4 is hard to comprehend without a model to index mapping similar to Figure 3"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper355/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling Factors of Variations Using Few Labels", "authors": ["Francesco Locatello", "Michael Tschannen", "Stefan Bauer", "Gunnar R\u00e4tsch", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Olivier Bachem"], "authorids": ["flocatello@tuebingen.mpg.de", "tschannen@google.com", "stefan.bauer@tuebingen.mpg.de", "raetsch@inf.ethz.ch", "bs@tuebingen.mpg.de", "bachem@google.com"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning. Recently, Locatello et al. (2019) demonstrated that unsupervised disentanglement learning without inductive biases is theoretically impossible and that existing inductive biases and unsupervised methods do not allow to consistently learn disentangled representations. However, in many practical settings, one might have access to a limited amount of supervision, for example through manual labeling of (some) factors of variation in a few training examples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such supervision on state-of-the-art disentanglement methods and perform a large scale study, training over 52000 models under well-defined and reproducible experimental conditions.  We observe that a small number of labeled examples (0.01--0.5% of the data set), with potentially imprecise and incomplete labels, is sufficient to perform model selection on state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Further, we investigate the benefit of incorporating supervision into the training process.
