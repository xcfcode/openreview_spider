The paper shows that an accuracy increase is possible with such a shortcut. However, the way the accuracy is calculated for the proposed model is very unrealistic. The accuracy is calculated by only accepting the correct answers from the mid-level output. This way of an accuracy calculation will likely show an increase when you take the best out of the two networks. It is also known that in many cases shallower networks are less accurate than deeper models, so it is only normal that mid-level output gives some reasonable predictions but in average worse than the final output. I am not convinced about the future of this work, since there is no conducted experiments with promising results.
