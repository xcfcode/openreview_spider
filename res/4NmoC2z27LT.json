Both are \npart of a topological structure, Morse-Smale complex, and together they provide an invariant\nlinking image to shape structure. An open neighborhood around these contours\nis related to human perception of shape features, such as\nbumps, which suggests that training for these features could provide a\ngeneralization benefit in algorithm development.", "pdf": "/pdf/460d0fcc8adea38eaddb7b6a9e3e3e813fb02fc2.pdf", "paperhash": "anonymous|topological_features_anchor_visual_shape_representation", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nanonymous2021topological,\ntitle={Topological Features Anchor Visual Shape Representation},\nauthor={Anonymous},\nbooktitle={Submitted to ICLR 2021 Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation Learning},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=4NmoC2z27LT},\nnote={under review}\n}"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"readers": {"values-regex": ".*"}, "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "signatures": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"]}, "content": {"authors": {"values": ["Anonymous"]}, "authorids": {"values-regex": ".*"}}}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL"], "invitees": ["~", "OpenReview.net/Support"], "tcdate": 1615225929161, "tmdate": 1615967298665, "id": "ICLR.cc/2021/Workshop/GTRL/-/Blind_Submission"}}, "tauthor": "~Super_User1"}], "count": 1}
