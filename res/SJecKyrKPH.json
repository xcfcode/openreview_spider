Therefore, a reconstruction decoder is employed. Another solution would have been to map the representative image to a lower dimension space and use it directly to calculate L-2 distance with max pool features.\n-> Another need for having a decoder is that we can visualize the reconstructed image and check the decoder's validity. \n\nRepresentative image?\n->There is no limitation that the representative image should only be a single image. Based on the complexity of the class, multiple representative images can be easily utilized in the network during training time. \n->The representative image helps the network to extract abstract features from the input image which are necessary to reconstruct a transformation free corresponding image. This idea can be easily extended to text-based models where the representative text can be decided based on the problem statement. (For instance, if we consider the problem of sentiment analysis which takes a text utterance as input and predicts its polarity to be angry, happy, etc., then, in this case, a representative text can be a vector which is close to the input text's corresponding sentiment in the embedding space.)\n\n If so, why not just rotate (rescale) the filters? \n->Given an input image, we want our filter generator module to generate the best filters based on the input image rather than explicitly changing the filters or features because during the test time we will not be knowing which transformations should be applied to the extracted features or filters. Therefore, a framework that automatically extracts the best input-conditioned features is needed. \n->Now the image can have rotation, translation or their combination, it is not feasible to explicitly handle these transformations by employing corresponding transformations in the feature or filter space. Therefore, a framework that automatically extracts the best input-conditioned features is needed.

They make some modifications to this, namely 1) they replace the convolutional filters, with input-dependent convolutional filters, and 2) they add a decoder network from the final representation, which reconstructs an input transformation rectified image, to encourage the final representation to be fully transformation invariant.\n\n*Paper decision*\n\nI have decided to assign this paper a reject because of two main reasons. \n\n*Supporting arguments*\n\nOne reason is that the base architecture is not novel. This in itself is not a key issue, but I would expect the authors to have done some in depth analysis or experimentation otherwise to compensate for this. I regret, the authors may just not have known that the ideas were already explored in the literature. The second reason is that the work is not well placed in context with prior works. This is both evident in the lack of referenced works (see below for a list) and the lack of sufficient baselines, against which they compare. For instance, if the authors had considered \u201cLearning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs\u201d by Weiler et al. (2018) they would have known that their MNIST-rot-12k results are not state of the art as they state. In Weiler et al., the authors report 0.714 test set error on MNIST-rot-12k compared to ICNN\u2019s 0.98.\n\nThis all said, I think the paper is well-written and very clear. The structure is straightforward and the experiments seem repeatable from the descriptions made. The stated aims of the paper are also clear: to learn input transformation invariant CNNs using input-conditioned filters.\nUnfortunately a lot of supporting material and prior work has been missed. I list a lot of them here. \n\nWorks on input-conditioned filters and invariance.

The contribution of the manuscript is two-folds\n(a) After transforming the input using a pre-determined set of transformations, a set of input-conditioned filter generators are used (and trained) to cater to different input contents.\n(b) A decoder is used after the max-pooling layer (of the  Siamese network.) And an L-2 reconstruction loss (with respect to a chosen class representative) is added to the cross-entropy loss for classification.\n\nOverall the paper is well written, and it is fairly easy to read. However, I am not totally convinced that the two contributions of the paper are significant to transformation-invariant representations, and my reasonings are follows\n\n1. Why is a decoder needed in the architecture? If the objective is to achieve transformation-invariance, one can easily compare the L-2 distance between the max-pooled feature maps of a given input to that of the class representative. Why bother using a decoding architecture?\n2. Choosing a \"class representative\" in the CNN seems very restrictive. Why if the underlying task is not image classification? Besides, I am very curious about the experiment on the CIFAR-10 dataset: do the constructed images of all test samples look like the one chosen class representative in the training data? (i.e., compared to figure 3)\n3. The input-conditioned filter generation seems a little confusing. Is this what you want to achieve? Say if the pre-determined transformations are rotation (scaling), then the input-conditioned filter should be generated as rotated (scaled) version of the same filters? If so, why not just rotate (rescale) the filters? There are lots of group-equivariant CNNs that have been proposed before for such effect. Besides, I am confused why fractionally-strided convolutions are used for filter generation?\n\nOther comments:\n1. The reference for fractionally-strided convolutions should be fixed.\n2. Why there is no bias term in convolutional modules (page 4, second paragraph?)\n3. What does ICNN short for? The first appearance of the abbreviation in the abstract needs more explanation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1850/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1850/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["surajtripathi93@gmail.com", "c.singh@samsung.com", "abykumar12011@gmail.com"], "title": "ICNN: INPUT-CONDITIONED FEATURE REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR TRANSFORMATION-INVARIANT NEURAL NETWORK", "authors": ["Suraj Tripathi", "Chirag Singh", "Abhay Kumar"], "pdf": "/pdf/d10a39b6c0a2291ea84dae419ff4b8ca056dd8fa.pdf", "abstract": "We propose a novel framework, ICNN, which combines the input-conditioned filter generation module and a decoder based network to incorporate contextual information present in images into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
