Here it would be good to be more specific about the domain, however, as approximating the low order terms certainly does not guarantee a global uniform approximation. \n\nTheorem 3.4 makes an interesting claim, that a finite network size is sufficient to achieve the best possible approximation of a polynomial (the proof building on previous results, e.g. by Lin et al that I did not verify). The idea being to construct a superposition of Taylor approximations of the individual monomials. Here it would be good to be more specific about the domain. Also, in the discussion of Taylor series, it would be good to mention the point around which the series is developed, e.g. the origin. \n\nThe paper mentions that ``the theorem is false for rectified linear units (ReLUs), which are piecewise linear and do not admit a Taylor series''.

To respond to the particular comments raised:\n\n- This is a very interesting question. In this work, we have supposed that connections between layers of a network are dense. In this case, the topology is given simply by the number of neurons in each layer, and this architecture is relatively versatile. Architectures of the form described in the proof of Thm. 5.1 (where the sizes of the hidden layers follow a decreasing geometric progression) should be especially flexible, able to learn a wide range of monomials and sums of monomials. Intuitively, this network architecture learns well because the initial large hidden layers capture many lower order correlations between input variables, which are then used to calculate higher-order correlations deeper within the network.\n\n- The conditions on the activation function appear to be at least largely tight. As we mention in the text, Thm. 3.4 fails for ReLU activation (where the Taylor series is not even defined), implying that all subsequent theorems also fail for ReLUs. More interestingly, it is possible to multiply d inputs with (slightly) fewer than 2^d neurons if the constant term in the Taylor series for the activation function is zero. We had previously proven that a less elegant exponential bound still holds as long as the dth Taylor coefficient itself is nonzero (without any assumptions on the other coefficients), and we have included this in our revision.\n\n- In practice, we are rarely concerned with uniform approximation for epsilon truly arbitrarily small. ReLUs can be (imperfectly) approximated by Taylor-approximable functions, and the behavior diverges as the desired epsilon decreases.

We have made explicit in our revision that these results hold for any (fixed) domain (-R, R)^n, and that Taylor series are constructed around the origin.\n\nWhile it is indeed true that a ReLU can be approximated by a smooth function with a well-defined Taylor series, any particular choice of such a function would fail our strict requirement of uniform approximation for arbitrarily small \\epsilon. Since we have assumed that the choice of nonlinear function \\sigma is fixed, we cannot use progressively better approximations to ReLUs. Another way of thinking about this is to note that a neural network with ReLUs is ultimately piecewise linear. For a fixed budget of neurons, the number of linear pieces is bounded. Given a fixed number of linear pieces and a general polynomial to approximate, the approximation cannot be better than some fixed \\epsilon (depending on the polynomial), whereas we would like \\epsilon to be arbitrarily small.\n\nTheorems 4.1 and 4.2 are in fact independent, with neither implying the other. This is because it is possible for a polynomial to admit a compact uniform approximation without admitting a compact Taylor approximation. We have made this clearer in the text.\n\nWe have rephrased our discussion of prior literature to emphasize that \u201cexistence proofs\u201d are a feature only of *some* of the prior work.

Detailed responses follow:\n\n1. We believe that in addition to presenting more general results than in the literature, we also contribute techniques that are significantly stronger than those in Lin et al. In particular, tighter proof techniques are required in order to prove lower bounds on the number of neurons required for a uniform approximation. One of the more interesting methodological insights resulting from our approach is that even though uniform approximation does not imply Taylor approximation, we can still use the lack of a Taylor approximation as a significant step towards proving the lack of a uniform approximation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Taylor approximation and uniform approximation of neural networks have been rigorously linked.\n\n2. The assumptions on the activation function can be weakened somewhat at the expense of less elegant formulations. We had previously proven that an exponential bound still holds as long as the dth Taylor coefficient itself is nonzero (without any assumptions on the other coefficients), and we have included this statement and proof in our revision. As we mention in the text, Thm. 3.4 fails for ReLU activation (where the Taylor series is not even defined), implying that all subsequent theorems also fail for ReLUs. In practice, however, we are rarely concerned with uniform approximation for epsilon truly arbitrarily small. ReLUs can be (imperfectly) approximated by Taylor-approximable functions, and the behavior diverges as the desired epsilon decreases. In running our experiments, we observed similar behavior with ReLUs as with Taylor-approximable activation functions, even though the full power of our theoretical results is indeed not applicable.\n\n3.
