We also summarize it here for convenience. Proving that overparameterization improves generalization in *any* learning task is very challenging. We show this for the first time in a novel setting which shares various characteristics with problems in practice.  We empirically show that our insights hold in a more general setting with non-binary inputs and 60 patterns in the data. We believe that our detailed analysis of gradient descent for XORD and concrete insights can guide results in more general settings. We also added a discussion of the generalization of the results to more advanced settings in the Conclusions section (which is essentially the last part of the comment to all reviewers above). \n\nRegarding the PAC looking bounds, note that our main result is a valid PAC generalization gap. Our convergence results, that hold under the assumption that the training set contains only diverse points, suffice for proving a generalization gap for distributions with sufficiently large p_+ and p_-. We also show empirically in Figure 1 that there is a generalization gap even for distributions with  p_+ and p_- that are not sufficiently large.

Please see the response to all reviewers above. Below we address the concerns raised by the reviewer. \n\nRegarding the main concern, the labeling function is fixed but the theorem holds for many distributions. We have changed the statement of Theorem 4.1 to reflect this. For the new statement we defined a new quantity p* in Equation 3 which is a property of the distribution. The theorem says that for any D with values p_+, p_- and p^* there is a data dependent generalization gap. The reason we previously chose a specific D is to get a precise range of values for epsilon. For different distributions the range of values of epsilon varies. Please see the details in Section 4. \n\nFurthermore, as in the response to all reviewers above, we note here again that proving that overparameterization improves generalization in *any* learning task (i.e., fixed labeling function) is a major challenge.\n\nRegarding the CNN architecture, we note that although the network is simple from a practical perspective, analyzing such a network is very challenging. For example, we are not aware of any theoretical analysis of over-parameterized two-layer convolutional networks with max pooling. We chose a CNN because it empirically showed the same phenomenon that overparameterization improves generalization, it solves the XORD problem (i.e., learns the function) and we were able to analyze it. We note that the data is not linearly separable and therefore XORD cannot be solved with a linear classifier.\n\nFinally, we note that the range of parameters for theorem 5.3 is quite wide: it allows for *any* learning rate <= 1/82 and standard deviation <= 1/1900. These upper bounds should be higher in practice and are an artifact of the current analysis. We added experiments in Section 8.4 to show that the gap exists even for values outside these ranges.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Over-parameterization Improves Generalization in the XOR Detection Problem", "abstract": "Empirical evidence suggests that neural networks with ReLU activations generalize better with over-parameterization.

Please see the response to all reviewers above where we respond to this concern. Proving that overparameterization improves generalization in *any* learning task is very challenging. We show this for the first time in a novel setting which shares various characteristics with problems in practice.  We empirically show that our insights hold in a more general setting with non-binary inputs and 60 patterns in the data. We believe that our detailed analysis of gradient descent for XORD and concrete insights can guide results in more general settings.\n2.    We revised the statement of the theorem. For the new statement we defined a new quantity p* in Equation 3 which is a property of the distribution. The theorem says that for any D with values p_+, p_- and p^* there is a data dependent generalization gap. The reason we previously chose a specific D is to get a precise range of values for epsilon. For different distributions the range of values of epsilon varies. Please see the details in Section 4.\n3.     The success probability decreases with larger m because our analysis holds only when the training set consists of diverse points. Note that this suffices to prove a generalization gap for sufficiently large p_+ and p_-. We empirically show that a similar result holds for training sets that contain non-diverse points in Figure 1.\n \n\nMinor Comments:\n \nWe revised the paper according to these comments.\nIt seems that the ICLR bibliographic style makes all titles lower case in the references.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Over-parameterization Improves Generalization in the XOR Detection Problem", "abstract": "Empirical evidence suggests that neural networks with ReLU activations generalize better with over-parameterization.

In this comment we include a response to all reviewers. We address the specific concerns of each reviewer in a separate comment under the corresponding review.\n\nWe would like to first emphasize again the main contribution of this paper. It is the first work in deep learning theory that explains the fact that larger models generalize better, by theoretically proving a gap in generalization error between smaller and larger models. Additional important contributions are a) Provide the first global optimality guarantee for learning a XOR function (in fact a more general case of XOR). b) Provide the first optimization guarantees for a network consisting of a ReLu layer, followed by a max-pooling layer. \nEach of the three contributions above is an important challenge for deep learning theory, and in the paper we show all three. We believe this constitutes significant progress. \n\nIt seems that the main concerns of the reviewers are a) That we are considering a single simplified learning task and b) Whether the analysis can be generalized. Below we address these two concerns.\n\n1. Study focused on simplified learning task: \nWe would first like to emphasize that proving that overparameterization *improves* generalization is extremely challenging due to two main reasons. First, to show a generalization *gap*, one needs to prove that large networks trained with gradient descent have better sample complexity than smaller ones. However, current generalization bounds that are based on complexity measures do not offer such guarantees (note that better generalization *upper* bounds for overparameterized networks do not prove this). Second, analyzing the dynamics of first-order methods on networks with ReLU activations is a major challenge. Indeed, there do not exist optimization guarantees even for very simple learning tasks such as the classic XOR problem in two dimensions (for which we provide guarantees in Section 9).\nThe above suggests that proving that overparameterization improves generalization in *any* learning task is highly non-trivial. Thus, it is natural to first try to understand this phenomenon in a simplified learning task. We believe that this approach can be fruitful for understanding neural networks in more complex tasks.\nAs a first step to tackle this problem, we devise XORD, a novel learning task which is an extension of the XOR problem, and provably show that overparameterization improves generalization. Although this is a simplified task, it shares salient features with problems in practice. Indeed, the goal is to solve a pattern recognition task with gradient descent trained on a 3-layer over-parameterized convolutional network with max pooling and a fully connected layer. \n\n2. Significance and generalization of result: \nOur result is the first to show a learning task where over-parameterization provably *improves* generalization for a neural network with ReLU activations. Our analysis reveals that in the XORD problem over-parameterized networks are biased towards global minima which detect more relevant patterns in the data. While we prove this only for the XORD problem and under the assumption that the training set contains diverse points, our experiments clearly show that a similar phenomenon occurs in other settings as well. We show that this is the case for XORD with non-diverse points (Figure 1) and in the more general OBD problem which contains 60 patterns in the data and is not restricted to binary inputs (Figure 2). Furthermore, our experiments on MNIST hint that this is the case in MNIST as well (Figure 3). By clustering the detected patterns of the large network we could achieve better accuracy with a small network. This suggests that the larger network detects more patterns with gradient descent even though its effective size is close to that of a small network. We believe that these insights and our detailed analysis can guide future work for showing similar results in other more complex tasks and provide better understanding of this phenomenon.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Over-parameterization Improves Generalization in the XOR Detection Problem", "abstract": "Empirical evidence suggests that neural networks with ReLU activations generalize better with over-parameterization.

This paper assumes the input data is generated from {-1,+1}^{2d} and a margin loss is used for training. \nThe main result is Theorem 4.1, which shows to achieve the same generalization error, defined as the difference between training and test error, the over-parameterized neural network needs significantly fewer samples than the non-over-parameterized one. \nTheorem 5.2 and 5.3 further shows randomly initialized gradient descent can find a global minimum (I assume is 0?) for both small and large networks. \n\n\nMajor Comments:\n1.  While this paper demonstrates some advantages of using over-parameterized neural networks, I have several concerns.\nThis is a very toy example, XORD problem with boolean cube input and non-overlapping filters. Furthermore, the entire analysis is highly tailored to this toy problem and it is very hard to see how it can be generalized to more practical settings like real-valued input. \n2. The statement of Theorem 4.1 is not clear. The probabilities p_+ and p_- are induced by the distribution D. However, the statement is given p_+ and p_-, there exists one D satisfies certain properties. \n3.

Specifically, we prove data-dependent sample complexity bounds which show that over-parameterization improves the generalization performance of gradient descent.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "theory", "non convex optimization", "over-parameterization"], "authorids": ["brutzkus@gmail.com", "amir.globerson@gmail.com"], "authors": ["Alon Brutzkus", "Amir Globerson"], "TL;DR": "We show in a simplified learning task that over-parameterization improves generalization of a convnet that is trained with gradient descent.", "pdf": "/pdf/547a9dd0b1e70ab29d1b53fa5d50793431f4e3f6.pdf", "paperhash": "brutzkus|overparameterization_improves_generalization_in_the_xor_detection_problem", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nbrutzkus2019overparameterization,\ntitle={Over-parameterization Improves Generalization in the {XOR} Detection Problem},\nauthor={Alon Brutzkus and Amir Globerson},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyGLy2RqtQ},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper988/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234331780, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "HyGLy2RqtQ", "replyto": "HyGLy2RqtQ", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335847865, "tmdate": 1552335847865, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper988/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 10}
