This paper is mostly about linear networks. While a result has been stated for single-hidden ReLU networks. In my view this particular result is an immediate corollary of the result for linear networks. As I explain further below given the combinatorial form of the result, the usefulness of this particular extension to ReLU network is not very clear.

What insights do you gain by knowing these theorems etc. Are less sufficient conditions that is more intuitive or useful. (an insightful sufficient condition in some cases is much more valuable than an unintuitive necessary and sufficient one).\n\n- Page 5 Theorem 2\n\tDoes this theorem have any computational implications? Does it imply that the global optima can be found efficiently, e.g. are saddles strict with a quantifiable bound?\n\n- Page 7 proposition 6 seems like an immediate consequence of Theorem 1 however given the combinatorial nature of the K_{I,J} it is not clear why this theorem is useful. e.g . back to my earlier comment w.r.t.

It provides the sufficient and necessary characterization for the forms of critical points of one-hidden-layer linear networks. Based on this characterization, the authors are able to discuss different types of non-global-optimal critical points and show that every local minimum is a global minimum for one-hidden-layer linear networks. As an extension, the manuscript also characterizes the analytical forms for the critical points of deep linear networks and deep ReLU networks, although only a subset of non-global-optimal critical points are discussed. In general, this manuscript is well written.   \n\nPros:\n1. This manuscript provides the sufficient and necessary characterization of critical points for deep networks. \n2. Compared to previous work, the current analysis for one-hidden-layer linear networks doesn\u2019t require assumptions on parameter dimensions and data matrices. The novel analyses, especially the technique to characterize critical points and the proof of item 2 in Proposition 3, will probably be interesting to the community.\n3. It provides an example when a local minimum is not global for a one-hidden-layer neural network with ReLU activation.\n\nCons:\n1. I'm concerned that the contribution of this manuscript is a little incremental. The equivalence of global minima and local minima for linear networks is not surprising based on existing works e.g. Hardt & Ma (2017) and Kawaguchi (2016).  \n2. Unlike one-hidden-layer linear networks, the characterizations of critical points for deep linear networks and deep ReLU networks seem to be hard to be interpreted. This manuscript doesn't show that every local minimum of these two types of deep networks is a global minimum, which actually has been shown by existing works like Kawaguchi (2016) with some assumptions. The behaviors of linear networks and practical (deep and nonlinear) networks are very different. Under such circumstance, the results about one-hidden-layer linear networks are less interesting to the deep learning community.\n\nMinors:\nThere are some mixed-up notations: tilde{A_i} => A_i , and rank(A_2) => rank(A)_2 in Proposition 3.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Critical Points of Linear Neural Networks: Analytical Forms and Landscape Properties", "abstract": "Due to the success of deep learning to solving a variety of challenging machine learning tasks, there is a rising interest in understanding loss functions for training neural networks from a theoretical aspect.

Below is a point-to-point response.", "comment": "Q1:  I think in the title/abstract/intro the use of neural nets is somewhat misleading as neural nets are typically nonlinear. This paper is mostly about linear networks.  I would suggest rewording title/abstract/intro.\n\nA: We agree, and we will reword neural networks as linear neural networks.\n\nQ2: From my understanding, the p_i have been introduced in Theorem 1 but given their prominent role in this proposition they merit a separate definition.\n\nA: We will separately define p_i, and further clarify their impact on the forms of the A_i. The p_i's in Theorem 1 can be any positive integer smaller than the corresponding m_i (i.e., the multiplicity of singular value sigma_i), and the sum of the pi's is equal to the rank of A_2.\n\nQ3: Given X and Y, can one run an algorithm to find all the critical points or at least the parameters used in the characterization p_i, V_i etc?\n\nA: We first note that in general, the set of critical points is uncountable and cannot be fully listed out. Hence, the characterization of the analytical forms of the critical points is more important in terms of its analytical structure, which can have a direct implication on the global optimality conditions and can be exploited to prove the landscape properties. \n\nOn the other hand, these forms do suggest ways to obtain some critical points. For shallow linear networks, if we choose L_1 = 0 (i.e., eq (3) is satisfied), we directly obtain the form of critical points A1 = C^-1 V^t U^t YX^+, A_2 = UVC, where C is any invertible matrix and V is any matrix with the structures specified in Theorem 1. For nonzero L_1, one can fix a proper V and solve the linear equation on C in eq (3). If a solution exists, we then obtain the form of a corresponding critical point. For shallow ReLU networks, one can find the solution of parameters from eq (12) following the same procedure as the above, and one needs to further verify the existence conditions in eqs (13, 14). For deep linear networks, in the case where L_k = 0 for all k (i.e., eq (6) is satisfied), we can obtain the form of critical points for any invertible C_k and proper V_k. For nonzero L_k, eq (6) needs to be verified for given C_k and V_k to determine a critical point. \n\nQ4: What insights do you gain by knowing Theorems 1, prop 1, prop 2, prop 3, Theorem 3, prop 4 and 5?\n\nA: The analytical forms in Theorems 1,3 help to characterize the global optima in Prop 2,5. They also help to identify the descent and ascent directions at critical points in Prop 3 and Theorem 4, establishing the landscape properties around them. Such properties then provide an alternative approach to show the equivalence between local minima and global minima.\n\nFor further insights, Prop. 2 case 1 implies that the parameter matrix A_2 must be full rank at any global minima. In particular, A_1 is also full rank at global minima in this case under the assumptions on data matrices and network dimensions in Baldi & Hornik (1989).  Similar conclusions hold for deep linear networks, e.g., if all the parameter matrices are square and the data matrices satisfy the assumptions in Baldi & Hornik (1989), then all global minima must correspond to full rank parameter matrices. \n\nQ5: Does Theorem 2 have any computational implications, e.g. are saddles strict with a quantifiable bound?\n\nA: Theorem 2 does not directly imply the strictness of saddle points. In fact, the saddle points in Theorem 2 can be non-strict for arbitrary data X and Y (the case we consider). As an example, consider the loss of the linear network L(a_2, a_1) = (y-a_2 a_1 x)^2, where a_1, a_2, x and y are all scalars. Consider the case with y=0, then L(a_2, a_1) = (a_2 a_1 x)^2. One can check that the Hessian at the saddle point a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1 is [2x^2, 0; 0, 0], which does not have negative eigenvalue. Thus, non-strict saddle can exist if data are arbitrary.\n\nQ6: Why is Proposition 6 useful, can you find the parameters of this characterization with a computationally efficient algorithm? \n\nA: Prop 6 is more useful in terms of the structure of the forms it characterizes for the critical points. For example, such forms in Prop 6 (and its special case of Prop 7) are exploited to construct a spurious local minimum in Example 1.

Below is a point-to-point response.", "comment": "Q1: Contribution of this manuscript is a little incremental. Equivalence of global minima and local minima for linear networks is not surprising, e.g. Hardt & Ma (2017) and Kawaguchi (2016).  \n\nA: We agree that the equivalence between global minima and local minima for linear networks has been established in the existing works. This work was in fact highly inspired by these previous results. However, the focus of this paper is different. The main results lie in providing the analytical forms of critical points for linear networks and ReLU networks, which further provides analytical forms of global optima (Prop. 2, 5) for linear networks and shows the existence of spurious local minima (Example 1) for ReLU networks. This type of results were not in Hardt & Ma (2017) and Kawaguchi (2016). We then further exploit such analytical forms of critical points to provide alternative arguments for the equivalence between local minima and global minima for linear networks, which were originally established in Kawaguchi (2016) by exploiting the necessary conditions of local minima. \n\nQ2: The characterizations of critical points for deep linear and ReLU networks seem to be hard to be interpreted. \n\nA: We agree that the forms of critical points for deep linear and ReLU networks are complex. But they can still be useful for various cases. For example, the characterization of critical points for deep linear networks in Theorem 3 further helps to characterize the global minima in Prop 5, and the characterization of critical points for ReLU networks in Prop 7 further helps to show the existence of spurious local minima in Example 1. \n\nQ3: This manuscript doesn't show that every local minimum of these two types of deep networks (i.e., deep linear and ReLu networks) is a global minimum, which actually has been shown by Kawaguchi (2016) with some assumptions. \n\nA: Indeed, under some assumptions, Kawaguchi (2016) established the equivalence between local minima and global minima for both deep linear and ReLU networks. However, Kawaguchi (2016) assumed that each ReLU is activated according to Bernoulli distribution, and studied the expected loss over the randomness of the activations. In this setting, the loss function of ReLU networks reduces to that of linear networks. In comparison, we neither assume nor average over the randomness of the activations in our loss for ReLU networks. In fact, we showed that spurious local minima do exist for such loss of ReLU networks (Example 1).\n\nQ4: The behaviors of linear networks and practical deep and nonlinear networks are very different. The results about one-hidden-layer linear networks are less interesting to the deep learning community.\n\nA: We agree that it is challenging to understand deep and nonlinear networks, and their behaviors can be very different from shallow linear networks. Ultimately, we agree that tools for studying shallow linear networks won\u2019t be sufficient. However, understanding shallow linear networks can still be beneficial in various cases. For example, our characterizations of deep linear and shallow ReLU networks are further developments of the characterizations of shallow linear networks. Such understandings allow us to show the existence of spurious local minimum for ReLU networks (Example 1), which is different from the behavior of linear networks. \n\nWe also thank the reviewer for pointing out the mixed-up notations.
