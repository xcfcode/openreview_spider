Both works focus on designing methods to introducing dynamicas into objectives/loss functions. Specifically, [1] tries to directly cast the objective function as a a learnable neural network (learned by measuring the similarity between model prediction and ground-truth). By contrast, we focus on learning the update schdules (parameterized as NNs) in problems where multiple objectives or/and sets of parameters are involved. Our formulation allows for tackling alternate optimization problems such as (1) GANs, where multiple objectives have clear difference with each other and are combined in a minimax form; (2) multi-task learning, that each objective of interest is well-defined and prefixed but an update order is missing; (3) or even EM-based maximum likelihood estimation where some inference procedures involved (e.g. MCMC) aren't in the form of a gradient-based optimization -- In all these cases, the objective itself might be difficult to be represented or approximated by neural networks.

Propose a unified framework for different loss objectives and parameters.\n2. An interesting idea in meta learning for learning loss objectives/schedule.\n\nCons: \n1. The formulation uses REINFORCE, which is often known with high variance. Are the results averaged across different runs? Can you show the variance? It is hard to understand the results without discussing it. The sample complexity should be also higher than traditional approaches.\n2. It is hard to understand what the model has learned compared to hand-crafted schedule. Are there any analysis other than the results alone?\n3. Why do you set S=1 in the experiments? What\u2019s the importance of S?\n4. I think it is quite surprising the AutoLoss can resolve mode collapse in GANs. I think more analysis is needed to support this claim. \n5. The evaluation metric of multi-task MT is quite weird. Normally people report BLEU, whereas the authors use PPL. \n6. According to https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-gan-lib, I think the bested reported DCGAN results is not 6.16 on CIFAR-10 and people still found other tricks such as spectral-norm is needed to prevent mode-collapse. \n\nMinor: \n1.

In [1], the authors investigate several features and develop a controller that can adaptively adjust the learning rate of the ML problem at hand, similarly in a data-driven way. In [2], the authors propose to manually balance the training of G and D by monitoring how good G and D are, assessed by three quantities and realized by simple thresholding. By contrast, AutoLoss offers a more generic way to parametrize and learn the update schedule. Hence, AutoLoss fits into more problems (as we\u2019ve shown in the paper).\nWe have appropriately revised the two claims and cited them in the latest version.\n\n>> Comment #10\nEmpirically, IS^2 or IS do not make much difference on the performance. The scaling term is a flexible parameter that controls the scale of the reward which we do not tune very much though.\n\n>> Comment #12\nYes, in WGAN, it is preferable to train the critic till optimality. We have revised the statement for accuracy -- we observe in our experiments, for DCGANs with the vanilla GAN objective (JSD), more generator training than discriminator training generally performs better (but this may not be an effective hint for other GAN objectives as they behave very differently).\n\n>> Comment #13\nWe have added Appendix A.8 to disclose all hyperparameters. All code and model weights used in this paper will be made available. \n\n>> Comment #14\nWe\u2019ve revised our statements to be more accurate: for all GANs and NMT experiments, we observe AutoLoss reaches better final convergence; For GAN 1:1, GAN 1:9, AutoLoss trains faster; for NMT experiments, AutoLoss not only trains faster but also converges better.\n\nWe\u2019d like to clarify that for all our GANs and NMT experiments, the stopping criteria of an experiment is either divergence or when we don\u2019t observe improvement of convergence for 20 continuous epochs. This is why in Fig.2, Fig.3(L) and Fig.4(c), it looks like that different methods are given different training time.\n\n>> Comment #15\nWe have update Figure.4(b) to a scatter plot, and fixed mentioned typos in the current version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper821/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper821/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper821/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AutoLoss: Learning Discrete Schedule for Alternate Optimization", "abstract": "Many machine learning problems involve iteratively and alternately optimizing different task objectives with respect to different sets of parameters.

We reply all comments below (relevant ones are put together):\n\n>> Comments #1, #11\nWe mainly account the success of this simple training strategy to the simplicity of the model, the relatively low dimensionality of our input features, and the simplified action space (though all  three suffice to obtain a good controller in the current settings). They make the training of the controller much easier compared to other RL tasks with higher dimensional features or larger output space.\n\nWe have added the detailed PPO-based training algorithm in Appendix A.1. While AutoLoss is amenable to different policy optimization algorithms, we empirically find PPO performs better on NMT, but REINFORCE performs better on GANs. As to the online setting, thanks for pointing us to the \u201cshort-horizon bias\u201d paper. We have indicated in the revision the existence of this bias -- this bias was observed on the GAN task -- overtraining G can increase IS in a short term, but may lead to divergence in a long term as G becomes too strong. On the other hand, we didn\u2019t observe it harms on NMT task noticeably. We hypothesize the tradeoff is insignificant on NMT, as in our multi-task setting, slightly over-optimizing one task objective usually does not have irreversible negative impact on the MT model (as long as the other objectives are optimized appropriately later on). \n\n>> Comments #2, #3\nWe\u2019d like to clarify that S=1 is consistent in the overhead section and Algorithm.1. S controls how many sequences to generate to perform a (batched) policy update (i.e. S is the batch size), and we set S=1 for all tasks. Only T differs across tasks, but we always update \\phi whenever a reward is generated.\n\nBack to comment #2: for regression and classification, we have experimented with larger S and found the improvement marginal. As each reward is generated via an independent experiment, the correlations among gradients are unobvious. For large-scale tasks, we use memory replay to alleviate correlations in online settings (please see Algorithm 2 in Appendix A.1 in our revised version). \nPerforming batched update with a larger S might help reduce correlations; However, a large S, as a major drawback, requires performing ST (S>>1) steps of task model training, in order to perform one step of controller update. This yields better per-step convergence, but longer overall training (wallclock) time for the controller to converge. There might exist sweet spots for S where one can achieve both good per-step convergence and short training time, but we skip the search of S and simply use S=1 as it performs well. \nIt is worth noting that some recent literature uses a stochastic estimation of the policy gradient with batch size 1 as well, and report strong empirical results [1].\n\n[1] Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing. ICML 2018\n\n>> Comment #4\nWe observe the controller performance on all 4 tasks are insensitive to initialization. A good initialization (e.g. in NMT, equally assigning probabilities to each loss at the start of the training) indeed leads to faster learning, but most experiments with random initializations manage to converge to a good optima, thanks to \\epsilon-greedy sampling used in training.\n\n>> Comment #5\nThey are the same -- there is a typo leading to confusion in the sentence \u201c...in Figure 1 where we set different \\lambda in l_2 = \\lambda |\\Theta|_2...\u201d; which should be \u201c...in Figure 1 where we set different \\lambda in l_2 = \\lambda |\\Theta|_1...\u201d. We have fixed it in the latest version.\n\n>> Comment #6\nPlease see the last paragraph in page 5. For regression, classification and NMT, we split data into 5 partitions D_{train}^C, D_{val}^C, D_{train}^T, D_{val}^T, D_{test}. AutoLoss uses D_{train}^C and D_{val}^C to train the controller. Once trained, the controller guides the training of a new task model on another two partitions D_{train}^T, D_{val}^T. Trained task models are evaluated on D_{test}. Baseline methods use the union of D_{train}^C, D_{val}^C, D_{train}^T, D_{val}^T for training/validation. For GANs that do not need a validation or test set, we follow the same setting in [1] for all methods.\n\n[1] Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. ICLR 2016.\n\n>> Comment #7\nThanks for pointing out -- we apologize for misusing \u201cexploding or vanishing gradients\u201d and have revised the paper to be accurate. We simply intended to clip the reward to reduce variances, and fount it effectively improved training. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper821/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper821/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper821/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "AutoLoss: Learning Discrete Schedule for Alternate Optimization", "abstract": "Many machine learning problems involve iteratively and alternately optimizing different task objectives with respect to different sets of parameters.

Below are replies to other comments.\n\n>> Comment #1\nWe agree vanilla REINFORCE can exhibit high variance. However, as we have elaborated in the text below Eq.2, to reduce the variance and stabilize the training, we have made the following adaptations referring to previous works [1,2]:\n- Substitute a moving average B (defined in text) from the reward\n- Clip the final reward to a given range\nWe empirically found the two techniques significantly stabilize the controller training.\nMoreover, AutoLoss is not restricted to REINFORCE, but open to any off-the-shelf policy optimization method, e.g. for large-scale tasks such as NMT, we introduce PPO to replace REINFORCE, and adjust the reward generation scheme accordingly (see the paragraph \u201cDiscussion\u201d). We\u2019ve also revised Appendix A.1 to cover details of how PPO is incorporated. Empirically, with random parameter initialization most experiments manage to converge and give fairly good controllers. \n\nAlmost all main results are averaged over multiple runs as explicitly indicated in the main text and the table or figure captions (e.g. see captions of Table.1 and Fig.2). See Fig.2 and Fig.3(R) where vertical bars indicate variances. We have also updated Table.1 to show the variance. \n\nWe will release all code and trained models for reproducibility. \n\n>> Comment #2\nWe have provided substantial analysis and visualizations on what AutoLoss has learned in our *initial submission*. Below, we summarize them for your reference:\n\n- d-ary regression and MLP classification\n*See sec 5.1, the 3rd paragraph in P6 for analysis, and Table.1 for comparisons to handcrafted schedules*: we observe AutoLoss optimizes L1 whenever needed during the optimization. By contrast, linear combination objectives optimize both at each step while handcrafted schedules (e.g. S1-S3) optimize L1 strictly following the given schedule, ignoring the optimization status. We believe AutoLoss manages to detect the potential risk of overfitting using designed features, and combat it by optimizing L1 only when necessary.\n- GANs\nPer our observation, AutoLoss gives more flexible schedules than manually designed ones. It can determine when to optimize G or D by being aware of the current optimization status (e.g. how G and D are balanced) using its parametric controller.\n- NMT\n*See sec 5.1, the 3rd paragraph in P7 and Fig.3(M)*: we have explicitly visualized in Fig.3(M) the softmax output of a learned controller and explain in text: \u201c...the controller meta-learns to up-weight the target NMT objective at later phase\u2026resemble the \u201cfine-tuning the target task\u201d strategy...\u201d.\n\n>> Comment #3\nWe experimented with S>1 and found the improvement marginal. However, a large S requires more task model training steps to perform one PG (or PPO) update, meaning longer overall wallclock time for the controller to converge. We hence use S=1 as it performs satisfactorily. Note that some recent meta-learning literature uses policy gradient with batchsize 1, and report strong empirical results [3].\n\n>>  Comment #4\nWe\u2019d like to clarify that we have *not* claimed that \u201cAutoLoss can resolve mode collapse in GANs\u201d. AutoLoss improves the performance of GANs by enabling an adaptive optimization schedule than a pre-fixed one. Our point is better and faster convergence of the model training. In the GAN experiments we *qualitatively* observed the generated images are of satisfying quality and exhibit no mode collapse. But we never claimed we aim to or can resolve mode collapse.\n\n>> Comment #5\nWe respectfully disagree with this comment. The NMT experiments aim to verify that AutoLoss can guide the multi-task optimization toward faster and better convergence on the target task, i.e. our interest is to see how the optimization goes instead of how the MT performs. Held-out PPL is the direct indicator of the quality of convergence, while BLEU evaluates the MT performance. Hence we believe PPL suffices as a metric to evaluate the performance of AutoLoss.\n\n>> Comment #6\nWe acknowledge that there may exist DCGAN implementations that achieve higher IS on CIFAR-10, but note the following facts:\n- The link verifies in a table that the best official IS (reported in literature) is 6.16 (the number we report).\n- The self-implemented DCGAN 1:1 baseline used in our paper (see Fig.4(c)) achieves an IS=6.7, higher than 6.16.\n- Still, AutoLoss-guided DCGAN achieves IS=7, higher than 6.16 reported in literature, our own implementation, and the result from your link.\n\nThanks again for mentioning spectral norm. However, these techniques are *completely orthogonal* from the scope of this paper, where we focus on whether AutoLoss can improve the convergence instead of resolving mode collapse. \n[1] Device Placement Optimization with Reinforcement Learning.

Below, please see our replies.\n\n>> What are the key limitations of AutoLoss? Did we observe some undesirable behavior of the learned optimization schedule, especially when transfer between different datasets or different models ? More discussions on these questions can be very helpful to further understand the proposed method.  \n\nThese are indeed good questions. We list several limitations we discovered during the development of AutoLoss:\n- Bounded transferability\nWe observe AutoLoss has bounded transferability -- while we successfully transfer a controller across different CNNs, we can hardly transfer a controller trained for CNNs to RNNs. This is slightly different from some related AutoML works, such as in [1], where auto-learned neural optimizers are able to produce decent results on even different families of neural networks. We hypothesize that the optimization behaviors or trajectories of CNNs and RNNs are very different, hence the function mappings from status features to actions are different. We leave it as a future work to study where the clear boundary is.\n- Design white-box features to capture optimization status\nAnother limitation of AutoLoss is the necessity of designing the feature vector X, which might require some prior knowledge on the task of interest, such as being aware of a rough range of the possible values of validation metrics, etc. In fact, We initially experimented with directly feeding blackbox features (e.g. raw vectors of parameters, gradients, momentum, etc.) into controller, but found they empirically contributed little to the prediction, and sometimes hindered transferability (as different models have their parameter or gradient values at different scales).\n- Non-differentiable optimization\nMeta-learning discrete schedules involves non-differentiable optimization, which is by nature difficult. Therefore, a lot of techniques in addition to vanilla REINFORCE are required to stabilize the training. Please also see our answer to the next question for more details.\nAs a potential future work, we will seek for continuous representations of the update schedules and end-to-end training methodologies, as arisen in recent works [2].\n\nWe haved add the above discussion to the latest version as Appendix A.9.\n\n>> As the problem is formulated as an RL problem, which is well-known for its difficulty in training, did we encounter similar issues? More details in the implementation can be very helpful for reproducibility. \n>> Any plan for open source?\n\nWe acknowledge the difficulties of training controllers using vanilla REINFORCE. During our development of the training algorithm (See Eq.2, the \u201cdiscussion\u201d section in Sec.4, and Appendix A.1), we found the vanilla form of REINFORCE algorithm leads to unstable training. We therefore have made many improvements and adaptations by either referring to existing literature, or depending on the specific tasks.

Clear paper.", "review": "Summary: This paper proposes a meta-learning solution for problems involving optimizing multiple loss values. They use a simple (small mlp), discrete, stochastic controller to control applications of updates among a finite number of different update procedures. This controller is a function of heuristic features derived from the optimization problem, and is optimized using policy gradient either exactly in toy settings or in a online / truncated manor on larger problems. They present results on 4 settings: quadratic regression, MLP classification, GAN, and multi-task MNT. They show promising performance on a number of tasks as well as show the controllers ability to generalize to novel tasks.\n\nThis is an interesting method and tackles a impactful problem. The setup and formulation (using PG to meta-optimize a hyper parameter controller) is not extremely novel (there have been similar work learning hyper parameter controllers), but the structure, the problem domain, and applications are. The experimental results are through, and provide compelling proof that this method works as well as exploration as to why the method works (analyzing output softmax). Additionally the \"transfer to different models\" experiment is compelling.\n\nComments vaguely in order of importance:\n1. I am a little surprised that this training strategy works. In the online setting for larger scale problems, your gradients are highly correlated and highly biased. As far as I can tell, you are performing something akin to truncated back back prop through time with policy gradients. The biased introduced via this truncation has been studied in great depth in [3] and shown to be harmful. As of now, the greedy nature of the algorithm is hidden across a number of sections (not introduced when presenting the main algorithm). Some comment as to this bias -- or even suggesting that it might exist would be useful. As of now, it is implied that the gradient estimator is unbiased.\n\n2. Second, even ignoring this bias, the resulting gradients are heavily correlated. Algorithm 1 shows no sign of performing batched updates on \\phi or anything to remove these corrections. Despite these concerns, your results seem solid. Nevertheless, further understanding as to this would be useful.\n\n3. The structure of the meta-training loop was unclear to me. Algorithm 1 states S=1 for all tasks while the body -- the overhead section -- you suggest multiple trainings are required ( S>1?).\n\n4. If the appendix is correct and learning is done entirely online, I believe the initialization of the meta-parameters would matter greatly -- if the default task performed poorly with a uniform distribution for sampling losses, performance would be horrible. This seems like a limitation of the method if this is the case.\n\n5. Clarity: The first half of this paper was easy to follow and clear. The experimental section had a couple of areas that left me confused. In particular:\n5.1/Figure 1: I think there is an overloaded use of lambda? My understanding as written that lambda is both used in the grid search (table 1) to find the best loss l_1 and then used a second location, as a modification of l_2 and completely separate from the grid search?\n\n6. Validation data / test sets: Throughout this work, it is unclear what / how validation is performed. It seems you performing controller optimization (optimizing phi), on the validation set loss, while also reporting scores on this validation set. This should most likely instead be a 3rd dataset. You have 3 datasets worth of data for the regression task (it is still unclear, however, what is being used for evaluation), but it doesn't look like this is addressed in the larger scale experiments at all. Given the low meta-parameter count of the I don't think this represents a huge risk, and baselines also suffer from this issue (hyper parameter search on validation set) so I expect results to be similar. \n\n7. Page 4: \"When ever applicable, the final reward $$ is clipped to a given range to avoid exploding or vanishing gradients\". It is unclear to me how this will avoid these. In particular, the \"exploding\" will come from the \\nabla log p term, not from the reward (unless you have reason to believe the rewards will grow exponentially). Additionally, it is unclear how you will have vanishing rewards given the structure of the learned controller. This clipping will also introduce bias, this is not discussed, and will probably lower variance. This is a trade off made in a number of RL papers so it seems reasonable, but not for this reason.\n\n8. \"Beyond fixed schedules, automatically adjusting the training of G and D remains untacked\" -- this is not 100% true. While not a published paper, some early gan work [2] does contains a dynamic schedule but you are correct that this family of methods are not commonplace in modern gan research.\n\n9. Related work: While not exactly the same setting, I think [1] is worth looking at. This is quite similar causing me pause at this comment: \"first framework that tries to learn the optimization schedule in a data-driven way\". Like this work, they also lean a controller over hyper-parameters (in there case learning rate), with RL, using hand designed features.\n\n10. There seem to be a fair number of heuristic choices throughout. Why is IS squared in the reward for GAN training for example? Why is the scaling term required on all rewards? Having some guiding idea or theory for these choices or rational would be appreciated.\n\n11. Why is PPO introduced? In algorithm 1, it is unclear how PPO would fit into this? More details or an alternative algorithm in the appendix would be useful. Why wasn't PPO used on all larger scale models? Does the training / performance of the meta-optimizer (policy gradient  vs ppo) matter? I would expect it would. This detail is not discussed in this paper, and some details -- such as the learning rate for the meta-optimizer I was unable to find.\n\n12. \"It is worth noting that all GAN K:1 baselines perform worse than the rest and are skipped in Figure 2, echoing statements (Arjovsky, Gulrajani, Deng) that more updates of G than D might be preferable in GAN training.\" I disagree with this statement. The WGAN framework is built upon a loss that can be optimized, and should be optimized, until convergence (the discriminator loss is non-saturating) -- not the reverse (more G steps than D steps) as suggested here. Arjovsky does discuss issues with training D to convergence, but I don't believe there is any exploration into multiple G steps per D step as a solution.\n\n13. Reproducibility seems like it would be hard. There are a few parameters (meta-learning rates, meta-optimizers) that I could not find for example and there is a lot of complexity.\n\n14: Claims in paper seem a little bold / overstating. The inception gain is marginal to previous methods, and trains slower than other baselines. This is also true of MNT section -- there, the best baseline model is not even given equal training time! There are highly positive points here, such as requiring less hyperparameter search / model evaluations to find performant models.\n\n15. Figure 4a.
