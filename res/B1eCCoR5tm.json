The validation accuracy of ResNet is much lower than that reported in the original ResNet paper, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf. For example, the top-1/5 accuracy of RestNet-50 is 79+/94+, which is only about 70+/89+% in this paper. Similarly, there is a big gap between the results of ResNet-152 reported in this paper and the original ResNet paper. Maybe I misunderstand something; otherwise, the results in this paper are not reliable.\n\t2. This work does not compare with any other data augmentation methods for testing, e.g., the widely used 10-crop test [ref1, ref2]: \u201cAt test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting five 224 \u00d7 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network\u2019s softmax layer on the ten patches.\u201d\n        3. A minor issue is the practical value of this work. If one can afford the computational cost of data ensemble test, why not train m (as the data ensemble in this paper) models and ensemble them given that ensemble of models usually brings more accuracy improvement? Note that the training of multiple models is conducted offline and the ensemble of models is of the same computation cost compared with the method in this paper. \n\n[ref1] Krizhevsky, Alex, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E.

Rather than multiple classifiers, the authors ensemble using multiple \u2018pseudosaccades\u2019 as input, with the same network.\n\nComments:\nI think that the proposed augmentation is a neat trick. However, the inner-workings of the method are poorly presented (or not well understood). For eg. In section 3.5, while discussing the effects of the method on individual classes, the authors mention \u2018different architectures do tend to be affected by the pseudosaccades differently\u2019 and provide no further insights.\n\nThere are no experiments that compare this method with other standard data augmentation techniques. For instance, one could use a similar ensembling technique for transformations like shear, translation, rotation, etc. by randomly sampling their corresponding parameters. I would be interested in experimental results that compare the proposed ensemble with ensembles constructed using these common techniques.\n\nSince there is no reason for this technique to be used in isolation (I found no such motivation in the paper), it would be insightful to have experimental results where this technique is combined with the aforementioned standard augmentation techniques. Will this method\u2019s impact on the accuracy change with these other augmentations? (Ablation studies would be useful).\n\nThis is a a form of regularization and can be thought of reverse structured dropout. Also have the authors compared this with Cutout [1, 2]?
