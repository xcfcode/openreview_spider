But labelled\ndata is hard to collect, and in some applications larger amounts of data are not\navailable. The problem then is how to use CNNs with small data \u2013 as CNNs\noverfit quickly. We present an efficient Bayesian CNN, offering better robustness\nto over-fitting on small data than traditional approaches. This is by placing a\nprobability distribution over the CNN\u2019s kernels. We approximate our model\u2019s intractable\nposterior with Bernoulli variational distributions, requiring no additional\nmodel parameters.\nOn the theoretical side, we cast dropout network training as approximate inference\nin Bayesian neural networks. This allows us to implement our model using existing\ntools in deep learning with no increase in time complexity, while highlighting a\nnegative result in the field. We show a considerable improvement in classification\naccuracy compared to standard techniques and improve on published state-of-the-art\nresults for CIFAR-10.", "pdf": "/pdf/3QxqXoJEyfp7y9wltP11.pdf", "paperhash": "gal|bayesian_convolutional_neural_networks_with_bernoulli_approximate_variational_inference", "conflicts": ["cam.ac.uk"], "authorids": ["yg279@cam.ac.uk", "zg201@cam.ac.uk"], "authors": ["Yarin Gal", "Zoubin Ghahramani"]}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "tddate": null, "tmdate": null, "cdate": 1454464564200, "ddate": null, "super": null, "final": null, "duedate": 1455833700000, "tcdate": 1454464564200, "id": "ICLR.cc/2016/workshop/-/submission", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2016/workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"pdf": null, "forum": null, "replyto": null, "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*", "description": "Your displayed identity associated with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "content": {"pdf": {"order": 4, "description": "Either upload a PDF file or provide a direct link to your PDF on ArXiv.", "value-regex": "upload|http://arxiv.org/pdf/.+"}, "title": {"order": 3, "description": "Title of paper.", "value-regex": ".{0,500}"}, "abstract": {"order": 4, "description": "Abstract of paper.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}, "authors": {"order": 1, "description": "Comma separated list of author names, as they appear in the paper.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "author_emails": {"order": 2, "description": "Comma separated list of author email addresses, in the same order as above.", "value-regex": "[^,\\n]+(,[^,\\n]+)*"}, "conflicts": {"order": 100, "description": "Semi-colon separated list of email domains of people who would have a conflict of interest in reviewing this paper, (e.g., cs.umass.edu;google.com, etc.).", "value-regex": "^([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))+(;[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,1}\\.([a-zA-Z]{1,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,30}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}))*$"}, "CMT_id": {"order": 5, "value-regex": ".*", "description": "If the paper is a resubmission from the ICLR 2016 Conference Track, enter its CMT ID; otherwise, leave blank."}}}, "invitees": [], "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "expdate": 1463609700000}}}], "count": 1}
