Since these methods work on random variables, the main idea of the paper is how to construct a random variable for a static entity using a proxy variable. Given the random variables representing two static entities, one can apply the existing cause-effect methods (e.g. ANM) to discover the causal relation between the entities. This idea is applied to three use cases: finding the original vs transformed image, finding the order of frames in a video and discovering the cause-effect relation between concepts represented as words, e.g. \u201cvirus\u201d causes \u201cdeath\u201d. \n\nThe paper seems novel and has some interesting applications of causal discovery. I found it a bit hard to read (also given the three page limit), so I resorted to a longer version (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07306) to understand some of the details. I have some concerns regarding the theoretical framework (there is not real cause-effect relation between the observed entities), its general applicability and the evaluation in the word pairs (some of the non causal methods seems to outperform the causal ones, although the authors present some possible explanations). On the other hand, maybe the ICLR workshop is a place in which some of these concerns could be discussed.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting application of cause-effect methods, could open the area to many new applications (e.g. plagiarism detection, image reuse, etc.).\n- Very good results on detecting which image is the original, and which video frame \u201ccauses\u201d another video frame.\n\nCons:\n- Unclear theory, the random entities don\u2019t really cause each other, so it\u2019s a bit unclear to me what are the cause-effect methods really discovering.\n- The promising experiments on images and videos are limited in scope (one dataset of DeepArt transformations of images and one single video example), which makes it unclear whether the results would generalize.\n- I don\u2019t completely understand what is a causal relation between words. I assume it is the causal relation between the underlying concepts, but trying to find it from text one may get instead the causal relation between having one word present in a text and another word in the same text.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Causal Discovery Using Proxy Variables", "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a framework to estimate the cause-effect relation between two static entities x and y: for instance, an art masterpiece x and its fraudulent copy y.
