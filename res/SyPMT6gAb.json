We apologize for the inconvenience because mistaking the hyper-ref box for actual parenthesis.\n\n- ( Z and loss L(z)) You are absolutely right the loss needs to be bounded in [0,1] for the theorem from Cortes et al. to be valid. In this work, because we didn't perform loss scaling to [0,1] but instead assume the loss [0,L]. We revised our theorems to reflect such bounded loss condition. \n\nAs for experiments, since the loss is only scaling factor, the minimization problem and its solution is essentially the same ( \\sum loss vs. \\sum loss/L). \n\n- (typos for +1 instead of -1) fixed\n\n- (why lower bound works) We apologize for the confusion here. \n\nthe lower bound exists because we are restricting the family of discriminators from all functions to all neural networks. This leads to the lower bound, however, since neural networks are essentially universal function approximators [1], the equality condition can be satisfied here in theory. \n\nFor the first and second inequality, the first one is an application of Fenchel duality and we also found the equality condition can be satisfied here. The swapping of sup T and E_x works because T is actually only a function of y so can be left out for integration over x.\n\nWe have updated our proofs and discussion and hope we can make things clearer.\n\n- (loop condition check) We use the estimator of divergence function obtained from empirical distributions as an approximation and check the value against the threshold.\n\nFurthermore, we have also established through proof that, the estimator using empirical distribution is a consistent estimator of the true divergence. (Sec. 4.1 proposition 1)\n\n- (typos) fixed\n\n- (baselines) why logging policy is CRF instead of NN? As our latter experiment shows, as the logging policy gets better, it will be more difficult to improve upon the logging policy, esp. IPS POEM which uses linear CRF as policy. so we only used linear CRF as the logging policy.\n\n(EDIT 1:50PM, 1/5: We just realized we have misunderstood your intent was not to suggest using NN as logging policy but show the performance of NN trained with supervised methods. We are really sorry but it's approaching the rebuttal deadline, we hope to provide such statistics asap)\n\n(EDIT : We just found out it is still possible to upload a modified manuscript, so we went ahead to upload an updated table. We used the exact architecture as of the NN policy with bandit training. The NN learned with supervised training has similar performance compared to CRF, and we think it might result from the over-fitting, as indicated by the high EXP loss)\n\n- (picking regularization hyper-parameter) This is indeed a very difficult question, as with other regularized ERM techniques. \n\nAs our Theorem 2 suggests, \\lambda is \\sqrt{L^2 log(1/\\eta) / N}, where L is the bound of the loss, \\eta is the probability of the bound to hold, and N is the number of samples, this sheds some light to how the \\lambda controls the bias-variance trade-off, where true risk < ERM + \\sqrt{(divergence-1)/N} + O(1).\n\nIn practice however, we believe the best approach is still start with the intuition from the theorem and play with cross validation.\n\n- ( \" it's unclear that such a bound can be tractably guessed \") We have provided a full proof of the bound, which is essentially an application of Bernstein inequality and Theorem 1 of our paper. But please let us know if you feel anything is unclear.\n\nAgain, we thanks for all the great comments you made to help us improve the paper and we really appreciate it.\n\nBest,\nAuthors\n\n[1] Hornik, Kurt, Maxwell Stinchcombe, and Halbert White. \"Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators.\" Neural networks 2.5 (1989): 359-366."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance Regularized Counterfactual Risk Minimization via Variational Divergence Minimization", "abstract": "Off-policy learning, the task of evaluating and improving policies using historic data collected from a logging policy, is important because on-policy evaluation is usually expensive and has adverse impacts.

You're correct about Fig. 4a) and 5a) and that the absolute loss doesn't change too much w.r.t to the stochasticity .\n\nIn the paper, when we were trying to discuss how logging policy affected the final performance, we used the relative performance (in our mind), performance(h)/performance(h0), to indicate how easy it is to improve upon h0. \n\nIn the stochastic experiment, based on the relative performance, we concluded it was harder and harder to improve upon h0, as h0 became more deterministic. However, the ability to improve upon h0 doesn't necessarily mean model performance, and our writings confused with two concepts. We've updated our writings to make a clear contrast.\n\nAnother point we were trying to make in the experiment is that NN policies without regularization performed slightly worse than the ones with regularization, which we think reflects the benefit of the proposed regularization. The trend is more observable in Fig. 4a) because of the scale of the Y-axis, so that we kept the figures the way they were.\n\nThanks again for pointing this out and the help in improving our manuscript!\n\nBest,\nAuthors"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance Regularized Counterfactual Risk Minimization via Variational Divergence Minimization", "abstract": "Off-policy learning, the task of evaluating and improving policies using historic data collected from a logging policy, is important because on-policy evaluation is usually expensive and has adverse impacts.

Here they first summarize the surrogate objective functions derived by existing approaches such as importance sampling and variance regularization (Swaminathan et. al). Then they extend the results in Theorem 2 of the paper by Cortes et. al (which also uses the empirical Bernstein inequality by Maurer and Pontil), and derive a new surrogate objective function that involves the chi-square divergence. Furthermore, the authors also show that the lower bound of this objective function can be iteratively approximated by variational f-GAN techniques, which could potentially be more numerically stable and empirically has lower variance. \n\nIn general, I think the problem studied in this paper is very interesting, and the topic of counterfactual learning, especially policy optimization with the use of offline and off-policy log data, is important. However, I think the theoretical contribution in this paper on off-policy learning is quite incremental. Also the parts that involve f-GAN is still questionable to me.\n\nDetailed comments:\nIn these variance regularization formulations (for example the one proposed in this paper, or the one derived in Swaminathan's paper), \\lambda can be seen as a regularization parameter that trades-off bias and variance of the off-policy value estimator R(h) (for example the RHS of equation 6). To exactly calculate \\lambda either requires the size of the policy class (when the policy class is finite), or the complexity constants (which exists in C_1 and C_2 in equation 7, but it is not clearly defined in this paper). Then the main question is on how to choose \\lambda such that the surrogate objective function is reasonable. For example in the safety setting (off-policy policy learning with baseline performance guarantees, for example see the problem setting in the paper by P. Thomas 2015: High Confidence off-policy improvement), one always needs the upper-bound in 6) to hold. This makes the choice of \\lambda crucial and challenging. Unfortunately I don't see much discussions in this paper about choosing \\lambda, even in the context of bias-variance trade-offs. This makes me uncomfortable in believing that the results in experiments hold for other (reasonable) choices of \\lambda.\n\nThe contribution of this paper is of two-fold: 1) the authors extend the results from Cortes's paper to derive a new surrogate objective function, and 2) they show how this objective can be approximated by f-GAN techniques. The first contribution is rather incremental as it's just a direct application of Theorem 2 in Cortes's paper. Regarding the second contribution, I am a bit concerned about the derivations of Equation 9, especially the first inequality and the second equality. I see that the first inequality is potentially an application of the conjugate function inequality, but more details are needed (f^* is not even defined). For the second equality, it's unclear to me how one can swap the sup and the E_x operators. More explanations are definitely needed to show their mathematical correctness, especially when this part is a main contribution.  Even if the derivations are right, the f-GAN surrogate objective is a lower bound of the surrogate objective function, while the surrogate function is an upper bound of the true objective function (which is inaccessible). How does one guarantees that the f-GAN surrogate objective is a reasonable one? \n\nNumerical comparisons between the proposed approach, and the approach from Swaminathan's paper are required to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Are there comparisons in performance between the approach from the original chi-square surrogate function and the one from the f-GAN objective (in order to showcase the need of using f-GAN) as well?\n\nMinor comments:\nIn experimental section, method POEM is not defined.\nThe paper is in an okay status. But there are several minor typos, for example \\hat{R}_{(} in page 3, and several typos in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2.\n\nIn general, I think this paper is studying an interesting topic, but the aforementioned issues make me feel that the paper's current status is still unsuitable for publication.

The swapping of sup T and E_x works because T is actually only a function of y so can be left out for integration over x.\n\nWe have updated our proofs and discussion and hope we can make things clearer.\n\n- (numerical comparisons) The POEM algorithm is the method from the \nAdith et al paper, and we believe the results demonstrated the superior performance of our approach.\n\nThe chi-square surrogate function (NN-CoTraining: min loss + \\lambda divergence ) comparison with the f-gan objective (NN-SeparateTraining, min loss s.t. divergence \\leq \\rho) can be found in Sec. 6.5.\n\nFor separate training, chi-square and f-gan has no difference because it only has difference in the RHS constraint by a constant 1. For Co-training, we have found the two approaches don't work well, while separate training performs much better than co-training \n\nThanks a lot for your insightful comments and please let us know if you need further clarifications from us!\n\nBest,\nAuthor\n\n[1] Hornik, Kurt, Maxwell Stinchcombe, and Halbert White. \"Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators.\" Neural networks 2.5 (1989): 359-366."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance Regularized Counterfactual Risk Minimization via Variational Divergence Minimization", "abstract": "Off-policy learning, the task of evaluating and improving policies using historic data collected from a logging policy, is important because on-policy evaluation is usually expensive and has adverse impacts.

Below are our point-by-point correspondence to your reviews and hope they can address some of your concerns and clarify things a bit.\n\n- (Regarding the stochasticity vs performance). Thanks for the suggestion for using a different type of policy and we experimented with policies with random exploration, i.e., \\hat p = (1-\\epsilon) p + \\epsilon, where p is the NN policy output, and similar trends hold. \n\nAs you may have noticed in the figure, the y values, ratio = test performance / logging policy performance gets greater than 1 after the stochasticity is considerably small. This suggests that the learned policy performs worse than logging policy on average, and demonstrates our main point in this experiment: as long as there are enough stochasticity in the policy, it is possible to learn an improved policy, while it is really hard to learn from a very deterministic policy.\n\nWe have revised the paragraph and hopefully it won't create further confusion.\n\n- (The proof of theorem 2) We've added the proof in the appendix section. \n\n- (Need for propensity scores) Yes, the availability of propensity scores is crucial to the algorithm. Cortes et al. provided a way to learn propensity scores and showed similar generalization bound, and we think this will be a very interesting future work. But the scope of this paper limits our exploration in this direction.\n\n- (No test on a real setting) We agree this is one of the limitation of our algorithm, but deploying such algorithm on-line such as large-scale ads placement system, is something we don't have access right now, so we have to resort to simulation studies. \n\n- (typos) Fixed them and thanks for pointing out!\n\nWe really appreciate your positive feedbacks on our paper overall and please let us know if our response needs further explanation.\n\nThanks again for your effort in reviewing our paper!\n\nBest,\nAuthors"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variance Regularized Counterfactual Risk Minimization via Variational Divergence Minimization", "abstract": "Off-policy learning, the task of evaluating and improving policies using historic data collected from a logging policy, is important because on-policy evaluation is usually expensive and has adverse impacts.
