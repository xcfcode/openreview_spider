This is not correct, commonly used methods, such as Hyperband (Li et al.) or BOHB (Falkner et al.), use successive halving (Jamieson et al.) which trains a batch of configurations for just a minimum budget and then already discards poorly performing configurations. I also miss a discussion of these methods in the related work section.\n\nHyperband: A Novel Bandit-Based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization\nLi, L., Jamieson, K., DeSalvo, G., Rostamizadeh, A., and Talwalkar, A.\nJournal of Machine Learning Research 2018\n\nBOHB: Robust and efficient hyperparameter optimization at scale\nS Falkner, A Klein, F Hutter\nProceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning\n\nNon-stochastic best arm identification and hyperparameter optimization\nK Jamieson, A Talwalkar\nArtificial Intelligence and Statistics, 240-248\n\n\n - Is the learning curve model updated during the optimization process with the new observed data? If not, is there any way the model can adapt to new data? Also, what happens if learning curves are fundamentally different to the training data, e.g if different learning rate schedules are used than for generating the offline data?\n\n - A simple baseline that is missing, is to use the last observed value as approximation for the final performance which often works competitively to more powerful learning curve extrapolation methods (e.g see Klein et al.).\n\n - The method is only applied for a simple random search strategy, however, in practice, one would use more sophisticated methods, such as for example Bayesian optimization. The question is, how effective is the proposed method in this setting, since the distribution of learning curves might be dramatically different and biased towards more well-performing configurations with almost identical learning curves.\n\n- I think the experiments would be more convincing, if the method shows strong performance when deploy in commonly used NAS/HPO methods, such as Hyperband or successive halving. This should be straight forward, since decisions which configuration is promoted to a higher budget can be made based on the model instead of just the last observed value.\n\n- What is delta in the experiments? How sensitive is this hyperparameter in practice?\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- Related to this paper is the work by Gargiani et al. which also models learning curves across datasets on offline generated data\n Probabilistic Rollouts for Learning Curve Extrapolation Across Hyperparameter Settings\n M Gargiani, A Klein, S Falkner, F Hutter\n arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.04522\n\n- Figure 5: visually it seems that all learning curves are almost identical, maybe it would be better if the plot could zoom in at least for the final stage of training.\n\n\n\nafter the rebuttal\n-----------------------\n\nI thank the authors for answering my  questions. In the rebuttal the authors addressed my concerned about the insufficient empirical evaluation and included other relevant baselines.

We discuss the listed related work and conducted additional experiments to compare to Successive Halving and Hyperband. We further added the last observed value baseline.\n\nThe model is retrained whenever new data is collected.\n\nIn our experiment the training protocol is not part of the search. This is a common setup in the NAS community. In order to consider this as well, we require the learning rate to be another input for the model and have training data with different learning rates. Fundamentally different learning rates due to different learning rates will be a challenge for our method. However, there is no existing work we are aware of that would not fail completely if the learning rate schedule is suddenly changed. Lets assume we use a learning rate schedule with restarts and different runs can have restarts at different intervals. All methods based on Successive Halving will fail because it will terminate those runs which have been restarted most recently. Also Domhan et al. assume a monotonously increasing learning curve and would not be able to fit such learning curves. All other works would only work if sufficiently many learning curves with different settings are observed. But this is also the scenario where our method will work. We hope to follow up on this discussion if you do not agree with us.\n\nBayesian optimization is able to manage the trade-off between exploring and exploiting the search space. A random search can be considered a search that only explores. In our experiment we sampled 200 architectures from more than 10^11 candidates at random. We believe that in this scenario even a more advanced search algorithm will be still in full exploration mode and not behave different to random search. However, the experiments for SVHN give you an idea what will happen if most learning curves are very similar which is probably the scenario you have in mind. As you see, more time is spend because it is harder to rule out specific learning curves early on. This is a general problem for all learning curve prediction methods. If really the case happens that BO is in full exploitation mode, one would probably consider to stop the search soon.\n\nWe believe that we can freely decide how our algorithm operates. We will consider to create a version which runs in a Successive Halving setting in the future. We have no influence on how the baselines work. To have a fair comparison to our initial baselines, we followed the very same setup. Based on the reviewers requests, we added Successive Halving and Hyperband. However, they don't perform outstanding such that we see no evidence that our method would perform better in this setup.\n\nDelta allows to trade-off precision and recall. It allows to decrease the training time at the risk of increasing the regret. Therefore you cannot really consider it sensitive it is more some lever you can use to change the behavior of the algorithm. We added a more elaborate discussion to the paper.\n\nWe are happy to answer any follow-up questions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2306/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2306/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["martin.wistuba@ibm.com", "tejaswinip@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Learning to Rank Learning Curves", "authors": ["Martin Wistuba", "Tejaswini Pedapati"], "pdf": "/pdf/33da53866a9f53de2f7681ee7b84874c35f534c2.pdf", "TL;DR": "Learn to rank learning curves in order to stop unpromising training jobs early.

We think that our method is applicable for both NAS and general ML but we admit that we only conducted experiments for NAS. Therefore, it is fair to assume that this paper focuses on NAS. In this short time we are not able to conduct an experiment for general ML. However, we are currently preparing a comparison against state-of-the-art NAS methods that leverage parameter sharing. We hope to finish this experiment over the weekend.\n\nQ2. Assuming that the learning curve is monotonous increasing just the maximum is exactly what all methods based on successive halving use. Furthermore, the last seen value is a strong baseline as pointed out by reviewer 3. For these two reasons alone this kind of modelling makes a lot of sense to us. However, we additionally added convolutional layers. They allow the model to learn to use first and second order gradients of the learning curve if this is considered useful. The resulting embedding vector is then used in another layer which may decide how important the features are. What ablation study would you have in mind? The problem with using all features is that the model will overfit. What we could do is use max pooling with strides. Since the architecture as modelled worked fine we did not consider changing it. As our ablation study shows, the learning curve component turns out to be important in its current form. We acknowledge that there might be scope for further improvement.\n\nQ3. A change in the search space will lead to a change in the representation. If this representation is again a sequence of tokens, our model will not change at all. If you refer to whether this model can transfer to new search spaces, then likely not. However, all learning curve prediction methods that are data-driven face this problem. That is a general property of machine learning algorithms. We refer at this point to the discussion with reviewer 3.\n\nQ4. We think this was addressed with figures 4 and 5 and their discussion. Can you outline in more detail what experiment you expect?\n\nQ5. We agree that there is always some uncertainty and that's why we investigated this issue and the probabilistic estimation of our model in section 4.4. We further compared our method to the work by Baker and empirically demonstrated to perform better. Can you outline in which case Baker would be able to outperform our method?\n\nWe are looking forward to answer your follow-up questions.

In this way, learning curve prediction can act as a fast method for performance measurements in AutoML. Compared with previous approaches, the proposed method allows for transferring useful knowledge among different datasets.\n\nWhile the proposed method is simple, the authors have shown promising results. However, I have some concerns about the motivations and usage of the proposed method. Please see the questions below:\n\nQ1. Learning curve prediction is a general approach that can be combined with many zero-order optimization methods. Does this paper focus on learning curve prediction on general AutoML problems or just NAS?\n- If the authors want to target general AutoML problems, they should perform experiments with (1) more datasets (come from various domains) and consider more (2) search algorithms. \n- For (1), the authors can follow Auto-sklearn and Auto-weka, or some experiments on graph (e.g., GCN) or some experiments on language modeling. For (2), they can combine the proposed approach with Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms. CNN has nice transfer learning ability, to show the wide applicability of the proposed approach is important.\n- If authors want to target at NAS, then the proposed method is not useful. Parameter sharing is a better method in NAS for fast performance evaluation. The authors need to compare with some recent NAS papers in CV (e.g., DARTS).\n\nQ2. \"Learning curve component\". Learning curves are naturally a sequence of data points. The proposed method simply does a maximum pooling over all positions, which ignores the sequence of data. Could the authors give some explanations? Is it better to carry an ablation study on this point?\n\nQ3. \"Architecture component\". How will the changes in the search space affect the proposed method? \n\nQ4. Could the authors random draw many architectures from \"NASNet search space\" and then plot their learning curve? It is better to show what kinds of curves will the proposed method likely to give early stops.\n\nQ5. Another main pitfall of the proposed method cannot offer a probabilistic estimation, which can be done by Baker et al. (2018). Since the model is early stopped, it is naturally that there are some uncertainty in the estimated ranks."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2306/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2306/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["martin.wistuba@ibm.com", "tejaswinip@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Learning to Rank Learning Curves", "authors": ["Martin Wistuba", "Tejaswini Pedapati"], "pdf": "/pdf/33da53866a9f53de2f7681ee7b84874c35f534c2.pdf", "TL;DR": "Learn to rank learning curves in order to stop unpromising training jobs early.

The authors propose to form this problem as learning curve ranking and transfer learning. Unlike most previous approaches for learning curve prediction, which estimates the probability of whether the current model is better than the current best model or not by first extrapolating the learning curve and then invoke a heuristic measure, this paper proposes to predict the probability directly. The pairwise comparison probability is modeled as the logistic function of the difference of a scoring function f, where f is modeled as a neural network with the learning curve data as the input, and constructed with three components, including a learning curve component, an architecture component and a data set component. The neural network f is trained with some meta dataset, and then the early termination is then decided based on this pairwise comparison probability. The paper applied the proposed early termination approach to the neural architecture search of five image classification data sets, and evaluated the performance in terms of the Spearman correlation of the learning curve ranking and the regret and time for the architecture search. It also analyzes the learning curve prediction characteristics through a few concrete examples, followed by some ablation analysis.\n\nThe proposed approach is novel to my knowledge, and the numerical performance is also satisfying and convincing. However, there are a few issues that this paper should better improve upon. \n\nFirstly, the methodology description at the beginning of section 3 is not clear enough. In particular, the motivation of choosing logistic function in (1) is not explained, and how the calculation of p_{i,j} from the final learning curves is done is also not elaborated. Some of the terminologies are also not clearly defined or specified. For example, what does \"posteriors\" mean (cf. the line before (2))? What is the meta-knowledge \\mathcal{D}? Is it the one used to train the neural network of f? There is also a small typo in line 2 of Algorithm 1, where d should be D probably. \n\nSecondly, although the numerical experiments are convincing within the framework of learning curves prediction, they are not sufficiently convincing when it comes to the scope of the neural architecture search (NAS) or hyper-parameter optimization (HPO). Comparisons with state-of-the-art NAS and HPO algorithms that do not use learning curves prediction (e.g., HyperBand, learning-by-learning algorithms using LBFGS, etc.) are not mentioned or compared with. The authors may either want to add comparisons with those algorithms, or provide some more applications of learning curve prediction to showcase the flexibility of the proposed approach."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2306/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2306/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["martin.wistuba@ibm.com", "tejaswinip@us.ibm.com"], "title": "Learning to Rank Learning Curves", "authors": ["Martin Wistuba", "Tejaswini Pedapati"], "pdf": "/pdf/33da53866a9f53de2f7681ee7b84874c35f534c2.pdf", "TL;DR": "Learn to rank learning curves in order to stop unpromising training jobs early.
