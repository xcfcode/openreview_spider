Reg. Equation (5): To derive equation (5), we do not require $W_{1}p$ to be in the same orthant as column vectors of $W_{1}X$. In fact, such a $p$ almost never exists. Hence, our approach is to find a $p$ that can minimize the error due to the additive approximation of ReLU ($\\sigma_{R}(W_{1}X+W_{1}p1^{T})\\approx\\sigma_{R}(W_{1}X)+\\sigma_{R}(W_{1}p1^{T})$). We linearly relax this criteria and search for a $p$ that can bring $W_{1}p$ as close to all the column vectors of $W_{1}X$. This is realized through optimization (5) by maximizing the inner product of $W_{1}p$ with all the column vectors of $W_{1}X$.\n\n2. Assumption for Lemma 1: Since our method is data-free, there must be an assumption tying data to the learned weights of the network. We assume that the singular vectors of the weights must have captured the discriminatory modes of data samples while training. This means that the first singular vector carries the most important features common to most of the data points than the other singular vectors, which translates to the assumption for Lemma 1. This assumption seems to be required for explaining the high fooling rate our method obtains.\n\n3. Other nonlinearities in the network: Currently, our theoretical explanation is limited to ReLU nonlinearity, which itself seems sufficient to reason out the high fooling performance. The effect of other kinds of nonlinearities needs to be studied in future works.\n\n4. Design of Algorithm 1: Algorithm 1 is designed from problem (10), where it is implemented as a set of sequential optimizations. We have an ablation in Table 2 with the header 'Ours without accumulation', where we optimize without the 'dilate' loss exactly like as the Reviewer mentioned. The results clearly evidence the performance boost with the 'dilate' loss.\n\n5. Results in less data cases: For VGG19 and Inception v1, with more data there is a slight dip in fooling rate. This seems to be something specific to the networks, but for majority cases the proposed approach beats GDUAP.\n\n6.

The main idea is to find a perturbation that maximizes the activations at different layers jointly. But the optimization is done sequentially, treating each layer\u2019s activation (before ReLU) as a linear transformation output.\n\nThe method is compared with existing methods (only one existing approach for the problem, GDUAP by Mopuri et al. 2018) in terms of the fool rate. It shows significant improvement. Ablation study is carried out to compare with baselines like perturbation maximizing only first layer activation, only last layer activation, etc. Also on some other settings (black-box testing, less data) the proposed method outperforms GDUAP. \n\nThe problem of data-free white-box attack is very interesting and does make sense. The proposed method achieve significant improvement over the previous one (GDUAP). I do have the following concerns though.\n\n1), the novelty of the proposed idea seems relatively limited. The proposed idea seeks perturbation maximizing activations over all layers. It incur perturbation before ReLU. But overall, the flavor of the idea is not significantly different from GDUAP, despite the significant performance boost. \n\n2), it was mentioned that compare with GDUAP, this paper has more theoretical analysis. But this is not very convincing to me. There are many steps of approximation/relaxation from the original problem (Equation (1)) to the final formula (Equation (10)). Many assumptions are made over the steps. It is OK to use these steps to derive a heuristic. But these steps can hardly be called \"theoretical analysis\".\n\nI am particularly uncomfortable with Equation (5), which is the basis of the main idea. It assumes that all data in $W_1X$ are in the same orthant as $W_1p$. But this is unrealistic as different data in X will for sure incur different activation patterns. Did I misunderstand anything?\n\n3) I do like the experimental results. It looks impressive. But the baselines are really limited (granted, there are not many existing approaches). There is only one task (image classification). How about other tasks like segmentation etc shown in Mopuri et al. 2018? Also it would be nice to also show the results of other UAP methods, as it gives us a better sense of the gap between with and without data.\n\n4) I wonder how will the attack affect some model which has been trained with some defense mechanism, e.g., adversarial training.\n\nTypo:\nEquation (5), RHS missing a max\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2022/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2022/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Crafting Data-free Universal Adversaries with Dilate Loss", "authors": ["Deepak Babu Sam", "ABINAYA K", "Sudharsan K A", "Venkatesh Babu RADHAKRISHNAN"], "authorids": ["deepaksam@iisc.ac.in", "abinayak@iisc.ac.in", "sudharsanka16@gmail.com", "venky@iisc.ac.in"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We introduce a method to create Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) for a given CNN in a data-free manner.

While it is interesting, the paper did not establish that universal adversarial perturbation is well-motivated and why data free is more important that model free or targeted perturbations.

The dilate loss function (4) is similar to the objective function (3) in the GDUAP paper. This paper provides a theoretical explanation of the dilate loss function and an improvement on the non-linearity function, which, however, is not convincing. Equation 10 is derived based on many strong assumptions. See the comments below.\n\nPros:\n-\tThe theoretical analysis is clear.\n-\tThe proposed method performs better than GDUAP in the data-free and black-box setting.\n-\tThe writing is good. The paper is easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n-\tThe theoretical analysis is based on many strong assumptions/criteria. For example:\no\tTo derive equation (5), W1X and W1p must be in the same orthant. It is unclear how to satisfy the criteria In the algorithm. \no\tIn Lemma 1, problem (5) approximates problem (6) only if x has a very large projection on the first singular vector of W. However, x and W are fixed and independent of p. This assumption largely depends on the dataset and the weights of the model.\no\tIt would be better if the authors show that in what cases these assumptions can be satisfied.\n-\tOther factors such as batch normalization and max pooling used in Inception v3, may also affect the linearity of the model. It would be better if the authors provide theoretical analysis or an ablation study on these factors. \n-\tWhat\u2019s the design principle behind Algorithm 1? Why can this algorithm solve the sub-optimal problem? The weights of different layers are not closely related. In the initialization part, why can we start learning p from the result of the previous layer? Would it be possible that the performance is improved due to the algorithm instead of the dilate loss?\n-\tThe proposed method performs worse than GDUAP does in some less data settings.\n-\tThe results in Table 4 and 5 are inconsistent. These two experiments use the same dataset (Imagenet) and the same number of images (D=64).\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2022/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2022/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Crafting Data-free Universal Adversaries with Dilate Loss", "authors": ["Deepak Babu Sam", "ABINAYA K", "Sudharsan K A", "Venkatesh Babu RADHAKRISHNAN"], "authorids": ["deepaksam@iisc.ac.in", "abinayak@iisc.ac.in", "sudharsanka16@gmail.com", "venky@iisc.ac.in"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "We introduce a method to create Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) for a given CNN in a data-free manner. Data-free approaches suite scenarios where the original training data is unavailable for crafting adversaries. We show that the adversary generation with full training data can be approximated to a formulation without data. This is realized through a sequential optimization of the adversarial perturbation with the proposed dilate loss. Dilate loss basically maximizes the Euclidean norm of the output before nonlinearity at any layer. By doing so, the perturbation constrains the ReLU activation function at every layer to act roughly linear for data points and thus eliminate the dependency on data for crafting UAPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only has theoretical support, but achieves higher fooling rate than the existing data-free work. Furthermore, we evidence improvement in limited data cases as well.", "pdf": "/pdf/753dcb8abc30e461917ca89b7e6cb5e874fd9e16.pdf", "paperhash": "sam|crafting_datafree_universal_adversaries_with_dilate_loss", "original_pdf": "/attachment/753dcb8abc30e461917ca89b7e6cb5e874fd9e16.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsam2020crafting,\ntitle={Crafting Data-free Universal Adversaries with Dilate Loss},\nauthor={Deepak Babu Sam and ABINAYA K and Sudharsan K A and Venkatesh Babu RADHAKRISHNAN},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxVC1SYwr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
