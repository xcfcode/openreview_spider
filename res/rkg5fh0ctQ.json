We've followed your comments and addressed the related concerns in our revision as follows:\n1) \"Hard to distinguish the authors' contributions from previous works\". \nOur model differs from the baseline model by Goyal et al. in three aspects. First, the most important difference is that Goyal et al. treated intents and slots as discrete symbols and train classifiers to make predictions on these symbols.  Such an approach limits the knowledge transfer between two domains as the classifier layers (affine transform leading to the softmax) following the upper two bi-LSTMs layers need be re-initialized when we transfer the model via fine-tuning in new domains, where the output labels are different.  In our model, we encode intents and slots as continuous representations via their constituent words. The classification problems are transformed to semantic similarity problems and the whole model parameters could be transferred to new domains. \n\n    The second difference is the usage of gazetteers (lists of slot values for a slot).  Goyal et al. used gazetteer features as an additional input. Such features are binary indicators of the presence of an n-gram in a gazetteer. In our model, we used an attention network (Section 3.3) to encode external slot values into a semantic vector that represents the slot from the value perspective, which suits our semantic framework naturally.\n    \n    Finally, there are no connections between the upper two layers in the baseline by Goyal et al.. However, we believe that the output of intent specific bi-LSTMs layer could benefit the slot detection task. As one of our contributions, in our network, we concatenate the output of common bi-LSTMs layer and intent bi-LSTMs layer to feed to the slot bi-LSTMs layer. \n    \n2) \"Authors do not discuss the objective\" The overall objective function for the multitask network completes two tasks: an intent classification task and a slot-filling task. We observe that this multitask architecture achieves better results than separately training intent and slot models.  In addition, we have the added advantage of having a single model to do these tasks with a smaller total parameter size. This discussion is added in the Section 3.4 in the paper.\n    \n3) \"Authors do not detail exactly how the model is fine-tuned\". We try to fine-tune different components of the model. We fix some parts and fine-tune on the other parts. After experimenting on several combinations of components, we found that fine-tuning the whole model gives the best performance. We have added this discovery to the manuscript.\n    \n4) \"This fine-tuning runs the risk of overfitting\". In the target domain, we also have a validation set to control the fine-tuning so that there is low risk of overfitting on the target data. We plan to consider different regularization methods in future work.\n    \n5) \"Some curious dips in the plot\". Discussion about dips has been added in section 4.1. Basically, we observed that almost all dips in the plots are related to the intent classification task. This might be related to the distribution of intent labels which have changed when we removed some data from the original training data set in the target domain. The change in data distribution increased the difficulty of learning.\n\n6) All figures have been modified so they are readable in grey-scale."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferring SLU Models in Novel Domains", "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a critical component in building dialogue systems.

We've followed your comments and addressed the related concerns in our revision as follows:\n\n1) \"Pretrain and finetune is straight-forward\" With the success of ImageNet, fine-tuning in image processing is very common practice. But in NLP area, especially in the SLU tasks, the process whereby a pre-training step is performed on a large dataset and then fine-tuned on a separate small target dataset has not been well studied previously. In addition, fine-tuning the whole model is not straight-forward. We found that fine-tuning the whole model gives us the best performance. We have added this discovery to the manuscript.  In the revision, we proposed to use semantic similarity as a bridge to transfer from one domain to other domains. \n\n2) Our work differs from previous works such as Goyal et al. in three ways. First, we encode intents and slots as continuous representations by their constituent words.  This allows us to better handle cold-start intents that are new and slots that cannot be handled by the baselines. Secondly, we use an attention network instead of treating gazetteers (slot values) as binary indicators in order to better calculate the similarity between unseen slot values and intents. Third, we discover that the intent prediction can directly help the slot prediction task, and we model it by adding direct links from the intent prediction to the slot prediction output.    \n\n3) \"Improvements ... to Hotel is not obvious\". The improvement of \"intent2slot\" mechanism is not obvious when transferring knowledge to the \"Hotel\" domain, because the correlation between intents and slots is relatively low in the \"Hotel\" domain. In other words, most slots can co-occur with any intent.  As a result, identifying a slot cannot help us to identify the intent of the sentence.\n\n4) We have proofread and corrected the document."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferring SLU Models in Novel Domains", "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a critical component in building dialogue systems.

Compared with the model designed by Chen et al., there are two novelties introduced by our model.  First, it transfers knowledge from the source domain in order to improve the performance in a low-resource target domain.

This is because our model has more parameters than the baseline DNN model and in some cases simper model performs better. However, in many practical domains such as our newly added real-world experiments, TSSM outperforms the DNN consistently. Discussion on these points are added in Section 4.3. Later, in our real-world production environment, in order to reduce model size, we removed some parameters like affine transformation matrix in semantic networks and the refined model performance becomes even better.

We've followed all reviewers' comments and addressed the related concerns in our revision as follows:\n\n1) Our work differs from previous works, such as Goyal et al., in three ways. First, we encode users\u2019 intents and slots as continuous representations via constituent words in order to handle novel and cold-start intents and slots that cannot be handled by the baseline methods. \nSecond, we use an attention network instead of treating gazetteers (slot values) as binary indicators in order to better calculate the similarity between unseen slot values and intents.  Results indicate that our methods are better than the baselines. Third, we discover that the predicted intents and the predicted slots might have high correlation values, and we model this correlation by adding direct links from the intent prediction to the slot prediction to improve effectiveness.\n\n2) We report two experimental results on three additional Chinese real-world datasets in the revised version. These datasets are collected from three products in our work as a result of our online autonomous customer services.  The data and observations were all from real industrial productions. The results show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed model on large-scale real-world problem settings. \n\n3) We revise *Section 3.1* to better explain the structure of the proposed model, and we proofread the whole paper multiple times.\n\nWe hope the reviewers can kindly reconsider our paper for publication after revision.\nBelow, we answer questions from each reviewer separately.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferring SLU Models in Novel Domains", "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a critical component in building dialogue systems.

At a high level, the authors argue that\nby fine-tuning a pre-trained version of the network on a small set of\nexamples from a target-domain they can more effectively learn the\ntarget domain than without transfer learning.\n\nFeedback:\n\n* An overall difficulty with the paper is that it is hard to\ndistinguish the authors' contributions from previous works. For\nexample, in Section 3.1, the authors take the model of Goyal et al. as\na starting point but explain only briefly one difference\n(contatenating hidden layers). In Section 3.2 the contributions\nbecomes even harder to disentangle. For example, how does this section\nrelate to other word-embeddings papers cited in this section? Is the\nproposed method a combination of previous works, and if not, what are\nthe core new ideas?\n\n* Some sections are ad-hoc and should be justified/explained\nbetter. For example, the objective, which ultimately determines the\ntrained model behaviour uses a product of experts formulation, yet the\nauthors do not discuss this. Similarly, the overarching message, that\nby fine-tuning a suitable model initialisation using small amounts of\ndata from the target domain is fairly weak as the authors do not\ndetail exactly how the model is fine-tuned. Presumably, given only a\nsmall number of examples, this fine-tuning runs the risk of\noverfitting, unless some form of regularisation is applied, but this\nis not discussed.\n\n* Lastly, there are some curious dips in the plots (e.g., Figure 2 bottom left, Figure 3 top left, bottom left), which deserve more explanation. Additionally, the evaluation section could be improved if the scores were to show error-bars. \n\nMinor: All plots should be modified so they are readable in grey-scale.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1290/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transferring SLU Models in Novel Domains", "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a critical component in building dialogue systems. When building models for novel natural language domains, a major challenge is the lack of data in the new domains, no matter whether the data is annotated or not. Recognizing and annotating ``intent'' and ``slot'' of natural languages is a time-consuming process. Therefore, spoken language understanding in low resource domains remains a crucial problem to address. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a transfer-learning method, whereby a SLU model is transferred to a novel but data-poor domain via a deep neural network framework. We also introduce meta-learning in our work to bridge the semantic relations between seen and unseen data, allowing new intents to be recognized and new slots to be filled with much lower new training effort. We show the performance improvement with extensive experimental results for spoken language understanding in low resource domains. We show that our method can also handle novel intent recognition and slot-filling tasks.
