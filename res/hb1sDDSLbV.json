To find those \"explanations\" it then proposes to combine gradients across examples in a \"logical AND\" fashion, i.e., pooling gradients sing a geometric mean with a logical AND masking. All reviewers agree that the direction is very interesting. While indeed mentioning sum and products of experts might be good, the overall idea is still very much interesting, also to the ICRL community, since it paves the way to apply this to larger set of machine learning methods, as actually shown in the experimental evaluation. Still, the authors should make the link to causality more obvious from the very beginning. This should also involve clarifying that \"explanations\" here do not refer to \"explanations\" as used in Explainable AI. Overall, this is an interesting and simple (in a positive sense) contribution to the question of getting at least \"more\" causal models.

We are glad you found the paper very interesting, well written, novel, and properly evaluated.\n\n**As the authors point out, the AND-mask is one of multiple possible ways to improve consistency, and it is unlikely to be a practical algorithm for all applications. It would be great if the authors can provide further insights on what kind of data distributions (or applications) could potentially benefit from the proposed method versus using the arithmetic mean:** \nThis is an interesting question. We believe that taking the arithmetic mean is suboptimal in situations where it is important to avoid finding spurious solutions. A potential application for our framework might be in vision for autonomous driving systems, e.g. where the change in colours of nearby cars should not affect the driving.\nAt the same time, we want to emphasize that large \"OR\" representations might not necessarily be worse in every setting. There might be settings where instead of learning only the invariant mechanisms, it could be best to have a large bag of (even partially) relevant features. This leads to your next point:\n\n**In addition, it would be interesting to explore hybrid methods that combine the advantages of pooling gradients using arithmetic mean and geometric mean (i.e., AND-mask):** \nWe agree, in practice what turns out to be most useful might be to learn both the \"OR\" and the \"AND\" representations, and rely on either of the two (or both) depending on the setting. While our threshold parameter attempts to build a bridge between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean gradients, the space of possibilities is ample for future work in this direction (early layers with OR and later layers with AND, pre-training with OR and fine-tuning with AND, etc.).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2015/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2015/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning explanations that are hard to vary", "authorids": ["~Giambattista_Parascandolo1", "~Alexander_Neitz1", "~ANTONIO_ORVIETO2", "~Luigi_Gresele1", "~Bernhard_Sch\u00f6lkopf1"], "authors": ["Giambattista Parascandolo", "Alexander Neitz", "ANTONIO ORVIETO", "Luigi Gresele", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf"], "keywords": ["invariances", "consistency", "gradient alignment"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the principle that good explanations are hard to vary in the context of deep learning.\nWe show that averaging gradients across examples -- akin to a logical OR of patterns -- can favor memorization and `patchwork' solutions that sew together different strategies, instead of identifying invariances.\nTo inspect this, we first formalize a notion of consistency for minima of the loss surface, which measures to what extent a minimum appears only when examples are pooled.\nWe then propose and experimentally validate a simple alternative algorithm based on a logical AND, that focuses on invariances and prevents memorization in a set of real-world tasks. \nFinally, using a synthetic dataset with a clear distinction between invariant and spurious mechanisms, we dissect learning signals and compare this approach to well-established regularizers.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "parascandolo|learning_explanations_that_are_hard_to_vary", "pdf": "/pdf/3609f7deb3e0f3fe924d4bcc0ad5015cebf79bad.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/24634113e503927fce74add72b9ff12eddc0e4a9.zip", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nparascandolo2021learning,\ntitle={Learning explanations that are hard to vary},\nauthor={Giambattista Parascandolo and Alexander Neitz and ANTONIO ORVIETO and Luigi Gresele and Bernhard Sch{\\\"o}lkopf},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=hb1sDDSLbV}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

Our work can be placed within the recent research direction of learning invariances and ood generalization -- such as Invariant Risk Minimization (Arjovsky et al., 2019), Risk Extrapolation (Krueger et al., 2020), IRM games (Ahuja et al., 2020) and generalization/memorization in neural networks (e.g. Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization, Zhang et al, 2017).

We answer your concerns in the following:\n\n**Connection to causality:** The algorithm and derivation we propose in the paper do not rely on assumptions from causality and as such we provide no guarantee that causal variables will always be recovered. Gradients (and Hessians) are strongly influenced by the inductive biases introduced by the choice of neural networks, and the method relies on these to define what is invariant and what is not.\nMoreover, given that we consider neural networks and a nonlinear setting, a theoretical characterization of identifiability (elsewhere proved based on strong assumptions such as, e.g., linearity of the model and Gaussianity of the errors, see Peters et al., 2015) is highly nontrivial for our setting.\nNevertheless, our work lends itself to be interpreted in a causal framework:\nFrom the point of view of causal modeling, $f$ can be thought of as a conditional distribution of the targets given causal features of the inputs; invariance of such conditionals is expected if they represent causal mechanisms (e.g., Hoover, 1990), that is --- stable properties of the physical world. Generalizing out-of-sample means therefore that the predictor should perform equally well on data coming from different settings, as long as they share the causal mechanisms. \nOur current work can be placed within the recent research direction of learning invariances and ood generalization -- such as Invariant Risk Minimization (Arjovsky et al., 2019), Risk Extrapolation (Krueger et al., 2020), IRM games (Ahuja et al., 2020) and generalization/memorization in neural networks (e.g. Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization, Zhang et al, 2017). A more formal study of our algorithm within the framework of causality -- with clear assumptions on the SCMs generating the data -- is an interesting direction for future work.\n\n**With unobserved confounding, it is known that the causal solution does not have zero loss gradient (for example in a linear model, least squares returns biased parameter estimates), what can we expect in that case?:**\nThanks for this interesting question! \nWhile an investigation of our method in a setting with linear models and unobserved confounding is possible and valuable, we believe that an in-depth theoretical and empirical analysis deserves its own consideration and goes beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, we ran a simple and very preliminary experiment based on the setting you suggest, i.e. a linear regression problem with confounding with three different causal graphs. We attach the code as a jupyter notebook in the folder **\"causal_graph_example_for_Reviewer3\"**. \nThe target invariant solution (i.e. the one using causal variables only) should be w = [1, 0] in all three graphs (but in the last graph the second variable is only a dummy variable). Training with ERM (classic arithmetic mean of the gradients) converges to biased solutions in all three cases ((A): [1, 0.33], (B): [0.66, 0.33], (C): [1.33, 0.]), while training with the and-mask as presented in the paper converges to [1, 0] on all three problems.\nWe find these very preliminary results encouraging and an interesting direction for future investigations.\n\n**The ILC is defined with respect to all local minima, I am not sure how such an objective would be attainable. More details here would be helpful:**\nThe derivation of the algorithm we propose is the result of a series of approximations to go from the original definition of inconsistency and ILC to the and-mask. Summarized, these are: ILC -> inconsistency of the minima -> hessians -> diagonal hessians -> geometric mean of gradients -> and-mask. We hope that future work will derive new algorithms using different approximations, e.g. optimizing the ILC objective using meta-learning. \n\n**If the objective is improved performance out-of-sample, why not evaluate the method on domain generalization tasks (office, caltech datasets, etc.)?**\nWe believe that strong performance on visual tasks is conditional on the presence of features optimized on large amounts of data or with clever inductive biases specific to images (such as data augmentation techniques and self supervised learning). With a poor inductive bias several spurious but invariant explanations might emerge regardless of the algorithm. Very recent work by Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz (2020) \"In Search of Lost Domain Generalization\" showed that in these tasks ERM is still as good or even better than most methods presented in the literature on OOD-generalization and domain adaptation. For this reason, we focused on tasks where we could study a purely algorithmic improvement. For example, the choice of a synthetic but challenging dataset allowed us to intervene on the data-generating process, and we could perform interesting experiments such as the one with the XOR and AND masks.\n\n(continues)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2015/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2015/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning explanations that are hard to vary", "authorids": ["~Giambattista_Parascandolo1", "~Alexander_Neitz1", "~ANTONIO_ORVIETO2", "~Luigi_Gresele1", "~Bernhard_Sch\u00f6lkopf1"], "authors": ["Giambattista Parascandolo", "Alexander Neitz", "ANTONIO ORVIETO", "Luigi Gresele", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf"], "keywords": ["invariances", "consistency", "gradient alignment"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the principle that good explanations are hard to vary in the context of deep learning.\nWe show that averaging gradients across examples -- akin to a logical OR of patterns -- can favor memorization and `patchwork' solutions that sew together different strategies, instead of identifying invariances.\nTo inspect this, we first formalize a notion of consistency for minima of the loss surface, which measures to what extent a minimum appears only when examples are pooled.\nWe then propose and experimentally validate a simple alternative algorithm based on a logical AND, that focuses on invariances and prevents memorization in a set of real-world tasks. \nFinally, using a synthetic dataset with a clear distinction between invariant and spurious mechanisms, we dissect learning signals and compare this approach to well-established regularizers.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "parascandolo|learning_explanations_that_are_hard_to_vary", "pdf": "/pdf/3609f7deb3e0f3fe924d4bcc0ad5015cebf79bad.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/24634113e503927fce74add72b9ff12eddc0e4a9.zip", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nparascandolo2021learning,\ntitle={Learning explanations that are hard to vary},\nauthor={Giambattista Parascandolo and Alexander Neitz and ANTONIO ORVIETO and Luigi Gresele and Bernhard Sch{\\\"o}lkopf},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=hb1sDDSLbV}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 0, "value-regex": ".{1,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "required": true}, "comment": {"order": 1, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}", "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).

This concept is interesting, especially since it can be incorporated with a clever understanding of loss gradients and hessians which underlies the generality of the proposed approach. \n\nThe presentation is puzzling to me. The objective for all intents and purposes is to recover the causal solution from data in multiple environments, but this is never explicitly mentioned even though causality is said to be a \"key element\" in the Appendix. In this area, also precise conditions are needed on data distributions from different environments which seem to play no role in this paper. A more thorough description of what can be expected from invariant solutions and when we are expected to consistently recover them is needed in my opinion. The introduction is therefore also vague, what do we mean by generalizing out-of-sample? Is the objective to ensure good performance with arbitrary shifts in distribution while maintaining a causal graph? Is there an assumption that the invariant mechanism is unique among available environments?\n\nRegarding the ILC, hessians and gradients I do see they are related but it is not lear to me how changing hessians would lead to optimizing for the ILC. The ILC is defined with respect to all local minima, I am not sure how such an objective would be attainable. More details here would be helpful.\n\nIn general, I found all experiments highly constructed and nothing like what you'd expect to see in reality. If the objective is improved performance out-of-sample, why not evaluate the method on domain generalization tasks (office, caltech datasets, etc.)? Invariant solutions may also be defined as minimizing a worst-case optimization problem across environments, yet the robust optimization literature is not mentioned.\n\nMinor comments:\n- I may be misunderstanding, but as described in the Appendix, does the synthetic experiment have shortcuts for both labels sampled from the same distribution?\n- With unobserved confounding, it is known that the causal solution does not have zero loss gradient (for example in a linear model, least squares returns biased parameter estimates), what can we expect in that case?\n\n\nIn summary, I do believe the proposed approach to be interesting but the context in which it is expected to work, as well as its relationships with causality, robust optimization and domain generalization are not well described; this prevents me from raising my score at this moment.

The authors claim that this is one important reason that machine learning with GD can't generalize well to out of domain dataset. To solve this issue, this paper focus on developing a method to learning the invariant explanations. The authors firstly formalize the a notion of consistency of the loss surface and also propose a practical algorithm, AND-mask. The authors also carried experiments and analysis on synthetic dataset to validate the effective the method. Overall, the work is important and the paper is well presented. I vote for accepting. \n\n\n##########################################################################\nPros\u00a0\n\t1. The paper studied the important problem of model generalization. The paper is well motivated and the knowledge presented can benefit the community. \n\t2. The paper defines the invariance as the consistency for minima of the loss surface. The author presented case study examples as well as math formulations. The presentation is clear and easy to understand.\n\t3. The authors validate the value of capturing invariance through the implementation of a practical AND-mask, and run experiment on a set of tasks. The baselines are reasonably chosen. The proposed method greatly outperforms other baselines. \n\t4. The synthetic tasks unveil the difference between ILC and gradient averaging. It is very helpful for the readers. \n\n##########################################################################\nCons\n\t1. The work claim that they run experiments on a set of real-world tasks. The authors introduce artificial label noisiness in CIFAR-10 by randomly shuffling the labels. However, recently work (e.g https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10528.pdf) found that noisiness exists in many popular datasets. It would be interesting to show that ILC can also handle such naturally introduced noises. \n2.

'learning invariant mechanisms with geometric mean gradient descent' is an example of a title that would be easier to understand: (1) mechanisms relates to prior work such as the pearl work that is cited (indeed, in the appendix the authors state 'causality... is a key element informing our exposition'). a causal mechanism is a well-known concept to the ICLR community. (2) concordance is still overloaded (e.g. this is a major concept in biostatistics) but not to the degree that consistency is. similarly, if you choose congruence, this could have the nice geometric interpretation in the hessian example that is helpful for understanding the work in figure 3.\n\n* the david deutsch quote distracts and confuses, remove it (i also know some researchers that might be immediately skeptical of a david deutsch citation in an ICLR paper). see above for ideas on title changes.\n\n* the first example is helpful to understand the goals of the paper. however, figure 1 --  the symbol with the plus sign and arrow is confusing, all the axes tick labels need to be much larger\n\n* the 'an example' chess example in the gray box on page 2 is unnecessary and distracting. instead, the discussion of the relationship to arjovsky et al could be inserted (with grass and cows), which is much more interesting and useful to a reader. \n\n* equation 1 engenders a double negative throughout the conceptual framing of the paper. i highly suggest considering renaming this to a 'consistency' score to reflect the name of the method; this will make it easier for readers to understand. \n\n* 'patchwork' may be another jargon word, try to find another one that is easier to understand. on page 3: 'low consistency of a classic patchwork solution' is loaded with jargon. first, a patchwork solution is not defined here or in previous work. second, a 'classic patchwork' solution is more confusing. removing adjectives such as 'classic' or even 'patchwork' throughout the paper may help readability and clarity. \n\n* i found the synthetic memorization dataset very difficult to understand. never start a sentence with math like p(y | x_{d_M}), it looked like it was connected to the previous with a \\cdot. ideally write out the functional form of the mechanism. the axes in figure 5 are not labeled, so i have a hard time understanding what we are looking at: are the x and y axes d_S or d_M? how is environment A vs environment B defined? \n\n* re: wording -- ideally delete shortcuts. do not introduce more unnecessary lingo, because it leads to sentences like 'the shortcuts are not shared across environments, but provide a simple way to classify the data, even when pooling all the environments together'. this is asking a reader to do a lot of work: (1) what is pooling? this has a standard usage. (2) what are environments? this is used in RL (3) what are shortcuts, and how do they relate to environments? trying to rewrite this, i would want something with fewer novel concepts, that focuses on mechanisms that are invariant across datapoints or groups of datapoints (groups of data arising from causal graphs, e.g. in causal inference terminology).\n\n* extremely minor, a few typos and inconsistent capitalization (section 3.1 is not capitalized, figure titles not capitalized, paragraph headings, figure legends not capitalized , good to pick one and stick to it)", "rating": "2: Strong rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2015/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2015/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning explanations that are hard to vary", "authorids": ["~Giambattista_Parascandolo1", "~Alexander_Neitz1", "~ANTONIO_ORVIETO2", "~Luigi_Gresele1", "~Bernhard_Sch\u00f6lkopf1"], "authors": ["Giambattista Parascandolo", "Alexander Neitz", "ANTONIO ORVIETO", "Luigi Gresele", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf"], "keywords": ["invariances", "consistency", "gradient alignment"], "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the principle that good explanations are hard to vary in the context of deep learning.\nWe show that averaging gradients across examples -- akin to a logical OR of patterns -- can favor memorization and `patchwork' solutions that sew together different strategies, instead of identifying invariances.\nTo inspect this, we first formalize a notion of consistency for minima of the loss surface, which measures to what extent a minimum appears only when examples are pooled.\nWe then propose and experimentally validate a simple alternative algorithm based on a logical AND, that focuses on invariances and prevents memorization in a set of real-world tasks. \nFinally, using a synthetic dataset with a clear distinction between invariant and spurious mechanisms, we dissect learning signals and compare this approach to well-established regularizers.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "parascandolo|learning_explanations_that_are_hard_to_vary", "pdf": "/pdf/3609f7deb3e0f3fe924d4bcc0ad5015cebf79bad.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/24634113e503927fce74add72b9ff12eddc0e4a9.zip", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nparascandolo2021learning,\ntitle={Learning explanations that are hard to vary},\nauthor={Giambattista Parascandolo and Alexander Neitz and ANTONIO ORVIETO and Luigi Gresele and Bernhard Sch{\\\"o}lkopf},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=hb1sDDSLbV}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
