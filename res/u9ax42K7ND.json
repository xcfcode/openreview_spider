A hierarchical meta RL method is introduced and the updating rules for sub-policies and meta parameters are provided. Experiments focus on this specific environment and hence the hierarchical structure is also specified as a meta controller over two sub-policies defined for navigation and shooting explicitly.\n\nThe proposed hierarchical RL method is not novel and indeed a most straightforward way to control sub-policies with a meta controller. The number of sub-policies, each of which is specified to solve an explicit sub-task, is fixed given the environment and the rewarding scheme is also clear that each sub-task has its own reward. The final policy is simply presented as linear combination of sub-policies. Actually, similar studies has been well studied in the literature, like Feudal networks and MAML, which are even more general meta learning methods to automatically find sub-policies. These highly related approaches are ignored from the discussion and not considered in the experiments as a baseline.\n\nAnother question is about the considered global reward, which is also formulated as linear combination of the sub-tasks' reward using the meta parameters \\alpha_i's. Under such a formulation, the rewarding scheme is dynamically varying as the training goes. One concern is that in IMPALA the estimated values in vtrace or advantage might suffer large variance since at early stages the meta parameters are almost from scratch. Another concern is that this rewarding scheme naturally restricts the meta controller to select sub-policy with high immediate R_i at a specific time step, and hence it seems the meta parameters are almost determined by the rewarding scheme.\n\nExperimental parts lack comparison of many related works as mentioned above. Moreover, only one specific environment is studied with only two sub-tasks. It is hard to see the generality of the method when scaling to cases where a large number of sub-tasks exist.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper101/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper101/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchical Meta Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Task Environments", "authorids": ["~Dongyang_Zhao1", "~Yue_Huang5", "~Changnan_Xiao1", "~Yue_Li5", "~Shihong_Deng1"], "authors": ["Dongyang Zhao", "Yue Huang", "Changnan Xiao", "Yue Li", "Shihong Deng"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Multi-task", "Hierarchical", "Meta Learning"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms aim to achieve human-level intelligence by solving practical decisions-making problems, which are often composed of multiple sub-tasks.

There are further questions around this: what kind of reward is used for the baselines (which are supposedly trained with a single reward)? What kind of reward does the value function for MeSH predict? The mixed reward as determined by the MetaNet? Then: The paper mentions that LSTM networks are used, but of what size? There are no details on complex baselines such as FuN, which are not trivial to implement or tune. Are the returns reported on a fixed set of levels?

The method is tested on a single, new environment (a first person shooter) against a small set of baselines.\n\nThis review will focus on the method but I personally find that this application with particular emphasis on \u2018killing\u2019 (as terminology from the paper), is highly inappropriate and the method could easily be tested on a less problematic domain.\n\nOverall, the paper is clearly written and the additional analysis on JS divergence and alphas in Section 5.3 provides an interesting perspective (which sadly turns into an analysis of semantic aspects of the game in terms of killing and how different amounts of enemies are handled).\n\nA main shortcoming of the submission is the evaluation section. Even ethical concerns aside, additional baselines from the existing HRL literature would be beneficial as e.g. [2]. In addition, another baseline MLSH (Frans et al 2017, referred to quickly in the submission) would be a good baseline. Meta-learning the high-level while applying IMPALA for the low-level (proposed method) is highly related to MLSH which meta-learns the low-level while learning the high-level individually for each task.\n\nOne core argument of the paper surrounds the combination of multiple policies in a single time step vs \u2018hard\u2019 switching between policies across time-steps. The combination of objectives for every output is familiar in the multi-objective RL literature [1] as well as other methods in hierarchical RL [2], work that would provide stronger context for the investigation. \n\nFinally, the evaluation focuses on a single task which has been introduced for this paper, strongly limiting the viability of the analysis. Further multi-task domains could be taken from the existing multi-objective/multi-task RL literature as well as via simple extensions of existing domains (imagine a cartpole environment with additional action penalty).\n\nThe final controversial point of this submission is the fact that the weights for combining rewards, which seem to also be used for the overall evaluation of the agent itself (though this remains ambiguous in the submission), are learned by the agent. This could on one hand lead to the agent finding a shortcut and ignoring some given objectives and on the other hand renders these weighted returns irrelevant for comparing different agents as the weights underlying the returns are part of the agent.\n\nOverall, the paper proposes an interesting method but the analysis has ethical problems as well as only a single environment which was created purely for this submission and limited baselines. While the main ideas underlying the method remain interesting, all these problems should be addressed before considering publication.\n\n\n[1] Vamplew, Peter, et al. \"Empirical evaluation methods for multiobjective reinforcement learning algorithms.\" Machine learning 84.1-2 (2011): 51-80.\n[2] Peng, Xue Bin, et al. \"MCP: Learning composable hierarchical control with multiplicative compositional policies.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2019.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper101/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper101/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchical Meta Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Task Environments", "authorids": ["~Dongyang_Zhao1", "~Yue_Huang5", "~Changnan_Xiao1", "~Yue_Li5", "~Shihong_Deng1"], "authors": ["Dongyang Zhao", "Yue Huang", "Changnan Xiao", "Yue Li", "Shihong Deng"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Multi-task", "Hierarchical", "Meta Learning"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms aim to achieve human-level intelligence by solving practical decisions-making problems, which are often composed of multiple sub-tasks.

I'll try to be as unbiased in my scientific evaluation of this paper, but I would request that the language be toned down a bit, and ideally other types of tasks considered down the road.\n\nBack to the review:\nThis paper presents a multi-task agent architecture with a final mixture component.  The authors show that this approach can work on a custom-built FPS game better than competing SoTA methods (both multi-task and mono-task agents.  Overall the method uses a bi-level optimization to find the optimal mixture of sub-policies as well as individually optimize each sub-policy.\n\nPros:\nThis seems like a relatively simple architecture and the empirical results are promising, and the analysis of alpha values correlation to sub-tasks is interesting and seems to indicate that the meta-controller does gain some insight into sub-task structure.\n\nCons:\nThere are many confusing points about the paper that made it hard to follow and that I would need clarified to argue for acceptance:\n\n1. Doesn't min(clip(\u03c1) \u00b7 A, \u03c1 \u00b7 A) = clip(\u03c1) A ?\n2. Doesn't $\\grad \\alpha L train(\u03c9 + \\epsilon \u000f, \\alpha) \u2212 \\grad \\alpha Ltrain(\u03c9 + \\epsilon\u000f, \\alpha) = 0$. Perhaps you meant \\grad w on the second term?\n3. What are L_train and L_val?  I couldn't find a clear definition.\n4.  Do the sub-agents receive the values of the respective R_i or is only $R = \\sum_i \\alpha_i R_i$ passed to the agent?\n5.  I am not familiar with bi-level optimization, it could be worth talking a bit more about this instead of environmental architecture choices which are relatively irrelevant to the core of the paper.\n6. Could you come up with  a task with more than 2 sub-tasks?  I find that 2 is likely a corner case and going beyond just two policies would make the method more convincing.  Trying out on a smaller more synthetic environment that would more easily allow task factorization would also allow for better empirical evaluation.\n7. Although I am not super familiar with the FPS environments for RL, are there some already existant environments that have been independently benchmarked?  Any FPS env has a mixture of navigation and fighting, so I wonder what the value of proposing a new environment for this would be.\n\nConclusion:\nI am not an expert of the multi-task literature but although the proposed idea seems to have merrits, the paper would need to be more clear on the points above for me to consider it clean enough for publication.  As it stands the approach is too opaque to really understand what is going on.  \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper101/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper101/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Hierarchical Meta Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Task Environments", "authorids": ["~Dongyang_Zhao1", "~Yue_Huang5", "~Changnan_Xiao1", "~Yue_Li5", "~Shihong_Deng1"], "authors": ["Dongyang Zhao", "Yue Huang", "Changnan Xiao", "Yue Li", "Shihong Deng"], "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Multi-task", "Hierarchical", "Meta Learning"], "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms aim to achieve human-level intelligence by solving practical decisions-making problems, which are often composed of multiple sub-tasks. Complex and subtle relationships between sub-tasks make traditional methods hard to give a promising solution. We implement a first-person shooting environment with random spatial structures to illustrate a typical representative of this kind. A desirable agent should be capable of balancing between different sub-tasks: navigation to find enemies and shooting to kill them. To address the problem brought by the environment, we propose a Meta Soft Hierarchical reinforcement learning framework (MeSH), in which each low-level sub-policy focuses on a specific sub-task respectively and high-level policy automatically learns to utilize low-level sub-policies through meta-gradients. The proposed framework is able to disentangle multiple sub-tasks and discover proper low-level policies under different situations. The effectiveness and efficiency of the framework are shown by a series of comparison experiments.
