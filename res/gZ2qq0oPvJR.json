This prover is applied on five domain-specific datasets, where theorems are relatively simple but their proofs are long and repetitive. The proposed theorem prover could achieve competitive performance with strong baseline provers, yet requires much few searches. \n\n\nI think the assumption of this paper is correct that we need more accurate heuristics but not more searches to find longer proofs. The main issue is that it is unclear what is the novelty of the proposed approach. The approach section of the main paper is quite short, just one paragraph (section 3) and one algorithm. It seems that the main approach is to train the theorem prover by reinforcement learning following a specific learning curriculum. It is not mentioned that why the proposed approach has advantages to finding longer proofs, and how the proposed approach is related to reasoning by analogy. Currently, the reasoning by analogy approach mentioned in section 2 seems irrelevant to the proposed approach, except that they may share the same effect and target to reduce the number of searches within the prover. \n\nI think the proposed approach shares the same form of heuristic as the prior work on neural theorem proving, that building a reactive policy to select the next action based on the current proof state. I can not see how this is related to reasoning by analogy, which is described as \"Reasoning by analogy involves observing the proof of one problem, extracting the core idea, and\nsuccessfully applying it to another\". All should we consider all neural-based provers as reasoning by analogy, since they are trained with existing proofs? \n\n=================================================\nAfter reading the responses from the authors and other review comments, I maintain my previous rating of this paper.

With respect to connection with analogy, please see the joint response to all the reviews.\n\n#### Why the learned policy wouldn't be subject to the the exponential blowup?\n\nSearch and exponential blowup is likely not avoidable in theorem proving in general. However, mathematics is full of important classes of problems where a deterministic algorithm is achievable and our aim was to demonstrate that FLoP can discover and internalise such algorithms. The models trained on the arithmetic datasets are confident enough to be evaluated without search/backtracking.\n\n#### How sensitive is the system to the training problems from which it forms analogies?\n\nTraining problems for Stage 1 and 2 were selected to be simple enough to be solvable by a random policy, while still capturing the complexity of the problem class. Many alternative training problems work just as well. Stage 3 is significantly more complicated. There, a problem can have many different proofs that are very different in terms of how well one can generalize from them.  Appendix I gives some examples when a shorter proof can be misleading, because it exploits a shortcut that is not always applicable. We found that the harder the training problems, the less likely they are solvable using such shortcuts, hence the more valuable training signal they provide. Our experiments with easier training problems (~shorter than 20 steps to prove) often resulted in massive overfitting even when using hundreds of problems. Hence, we selected training problems to be hard enough to resist overfitting to some shortcut. Note that problems in Stage 3 are versatile enough so that our training problems do not cover all the proof patterns in the test set. Many alternative training problems of the same complexity (over 100 steps to prove) can be considered and we conjecture that we would get better results if we trained on more such problems.\n\n#### How much do you depend on the particular feature space?\n\nWe decided to use a feature representation that was successfully applied in several previous works in theorem proving, without modification to make our system better comparable. The features provide a fast baseline that were not tuned for our datasets - we used them as provided by the independently developed fCoP kernel. Learned feature extraction of logical objects is a separate line of research and we agree that a natural improvement on FLoP can be to incorporate such methods.  Note, however, that neural formula embedding entails further slowdown of the guidance, making it hard to remain competitive in real time. Several experiments have shown the challenge to improve upon the features used in FLoP by neural embeddings (e.g. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29436-6_12 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02065v3).\n\n#### Minor comments\n\nYou are right about Figures 2/3, we use kernel density estimation. We will state this more explicitly in the paper. We are grateful for all the other comments and will update the paper accordingly.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3402/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3402/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Finding Longer Proofs", "authorids": ["~Zsolt_Zombori1", "~Adri\u00e1n_Csisz\u00e1rik1", "~Henryk_Michalewski1", "~Cezary_Kaliszyk1", "~Josef_Urban1"], "authors": ["Zsolt Zombori", "Adri\u00e1n Csisz\u00e1rik", "Henryk Michalewski", "Cezary Kaliszyk", "Josef Urban"], "keywords": ["automated reasoning", "reinforcement learning", "reasoning by analogy"], "abstract": "We present a reinforcement learning (RL) based guidance system for automated theorem proving geared towards Finding Longer Proofs (FLoP).

Since then, there is at least one other paper using policy gradient for theorem proving: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02065v3. This learning setup, coupled with curriculum learning, allows us to train on some rather long proofs in Stage 3, with much less overfitting than in supervised learning.

We would like to use this space to answer issues raised by all of you and then respond to individual comments separately.\n\n#### Connection with analogy\n\nIn our paper, we have interpreted analogical reasoning as building a model that internalizes a proof, and then successfully applies it to a class of related problems, without relying much on search. The trained model is supposed to \"know\" the proof of an unseen, yet familiar problem. This is a highly simplified approach which does not capture the full potential of analogy, but we argue that it is a meaningful start that will hopefully lead to more refined solutions. In particular, our model does not yet manipulate on the level of abstraction of proof objects, rather that of a sequence of proof steps. Note, however, that this is also true of previous works on theorem proving by analogy, trying to establish direct matchings between steps in one proof and steps in another, using all sorts of methods/heuristics. Machine learning can make this proof step matching process automatic and allows to replace one-to-one mappings with many-to-many mappings. To some extent, this is true of most works using ML for ATP. Our paper has tried to push this direction further, making analogy and elimination of search more explicit. Prior and parallel works have built similar guiding policies, but they have not demonstrated similarly successful internalisation of a proof method. We will make our interpretation of analogy more explicit in the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3402/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3402/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards Finding Longer Proofs", "authorids": ["~Zsolt_Zombori1", "~Adri\u00e1n_Csisz\u00e1rik1", "~Henryk_Michalewski1", "~Cezary_Kaliszyk1", "~Josef_Urban1"], "authors": ["Zsolt Zombori", "Adri\u00e1n Csisz\u00e1rik", "Henryk Michalewski", "Cezary Kaliszyk", "Josef Urban"], "keywords": ["automated reasoning", "reinforcement learning", "reasoning by analogy"], "abstract": "We present a reinforcement learning (RL) based guidance system for automated theorem proving geared towards Finding Longer Proofs (FLoP).

At its core it works by inputting a corpus of training problems (which can also be annotated with solutions i.e. proofs), training a policy to solve these training problems by curriculum learning. The curriculum works by first supervising on the trace of an entire solution, and then once the system can solve a particular problem, decreasing the amount of the trace that it supervises on. The authors claim that this is a kind of analogical reasoning, because the system's policy is implicitly learning to represent the state/action space on the basis of prior experience.\n\nI'm not convinced that this looks very much like the analogical reasoning advertised in the introduction to the paper , which claims \"Reasoning by analogy involves observing the proof of one problem, extracting the core idea, andsuccessfully applying it to another\". The system does not work by fetching previous proofs and massaging them into a proof for a new problem, except implicitly through the prior knowledge represented in the weights of the policy. My only real objection to this work is that it doesn't function as advertised. In particular I'm not sure why the learned policy wouldn't be subject to the \"the exponential blowup [which causes] the search... to fail beyond a certain depth,\" which afflicts prior methods.\n\nIMO this paper should be accepted iff this approach is a new advance for automated theorem proving, but should not be accepted on the basis of it's connection to reasoning by analogy. However, it is possible that I have misunderstood how the algorithm works, and would like to be corrected by the authors if indeed the algorithm works as advertised. Because I am not well steeped in the automated theorem proving literature, I do not feel qualified to make the call on how big of an advance this is for that community. However, it does not seem like a large advance for deep learning or for combinatorial search.\n\nPros:\n+ seems to scale to some extraordinarily long proofs! For example, their system can discover proofs with steps on the order of 10^3-10^4. Given the combinatorial explosion in the search space (scales exponentially with proof length) this is quite impressive.\n+ reasoning by analogy is crucial yet underexplored. It should be especially important for few-shot learning of proof strategies, and I'm glad that the authors have taken up this line of research.\n\nCons/questions:\n- How sensitive is the system to the training problems from which it forms analogies? For instance experiment 3 hinges on two particular seed expressions--how did you choose them?\n- How much do you depend on the particular feature space? Appendix F lists what seem like a relatively impoverished feature representation for the state space. Is this intentional, whereby narrowing the feature space you improve transfer between the target (training) and source (test) proofs? In that case it would seem that the method would struggle absent careful feature engineering, which could limit its applicability beyond the simple theories considered here (nb: although the theories are simple the proofs are extraordinarily long)\n\nMinor concerns:\ntypo page 3 - \"allows for potential reusing\" (potential to potentially)\nmissing citation page 3 - \"Despite the unquestioned role of...\" (include citation to \"Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning\")\nmake figure one larger\nfigures 2/3: surely you must be doing some kind of kernel density smoothing here?\nexperiment 1/table 2: describe E2--which is at ceiling--as exploiting hand-crafted domain-specific strategies for arithmetic, preferably in the caption.
