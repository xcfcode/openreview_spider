A hierarchical clustering is easier and more accurate for a human to give his judgment.\n\nNext, we would like to address reviewer\u2019s suggestion of tuning down the connection between our work and human vision. \n\nQuoting reviewer 2:\n>\u201cI think the paper goes too far in linking itself to human vision. I would prefer the intro not have as much cognitive science or neuroscience. The second to fourth paragraphs of the intro in particular feels like it over-stating the contribution of this paper as somehow revealing some truth about human vision. Really, the narrative is much simpler -- \"we often want deep feature representations that are viewpoint invariant. We supervise a deep network accordingly. Humans also have some capability to be viewpoint invariant which has been widely studied [citations]\". I am skeptical of any claimed connections bigger than that.\u201d\n\n>\u201cI don't think \"Remarkably\" is justified in the statement \"Remarkably, we found that OPnets similarity judgment matches a set of data on human similarity judgment, significantly better than AlexNet\"\n\nThe motivation of our work articulated in the Introduction (including paragraph 2 and 4) is truly our motivation for starting and doing this project.  Our objective is to investigate what will take for a deep network to develop the ability of similarity grouping and judgment of NOVEL objects or classes of objects not in the training set as in Tenanbaum\u2019s Science paper, and then we hit on the idea of using Siamnese triplet to evaluate whether the object continuity / object persistence constraint hypothesized by theoretical neuroscientists can lead to network that better approximates the performance of human. That view-manifold training will lead to similarity perception close to human is a conjecture that we seek to empirically investigate. Thus, we do find it remarkable that this view-invariant learning allows the network to \u201csee\u201d the similarity of novel objects in a way that is similar to human (as in Tenenbaum\u2019s results), which we must say it is rather unexpected. As we moved on this project, we realized there were similar works in the computer vision works, including those pointed out by reviewer 1 that we were not familiar with at the time, and our work became more technically driven and phrased. Even though we used the image retrieval task and precision-recall metrics for evaluation, we should not lose sight that our goal is to understand how systems can learn to see similarity in novel objects like human. \n\nThat said, we do agree with reviewer 3, the main evidence that directly supported our conjecture is the correlation with Tenenbaum\u2019s results on human perceptual similarity grouping, though we assumed different views of the same object, and between objects of the same categories are considered more similar at semantic level (e.g. Erdogen et al. 2014, Goldstone and Day 2013 see references below ). Nevertheless, we thank the reviewer\u2019s cautionary note and accordingly tuned down our claim on the possible implications of this work on human similarity judgment particularly in the Final Discussion.  However, we wish to keep our motivation in the introduction, because (1) that is the motivation of our project, (2) we believe there are some deep links between deep network and human visual system, so it is important to discuss them and explore their interesting connections, particularly in a deep learning conference like ICLR. \n\n[1] Quian Quiroga, R., Reddy, L., Kreiman, G., Koch, C. & Fried, I.\u00a0\u00a0Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain.\u00a0Nature\u00a0 435, 1102\u20131107 (2005).\n\n[2]\u00a0 Erdogen G, Yildirim and Jacobs R.

We have considered those papers and acted on them, and made three revisions per your suggestions. \n\n1. We compare our approach with the joint embedding approach discussed in Su et al\u2019s SIGGRAPH paper, using a model pre-trained on the chair category, provided by the authors. We test this on the chair category of ShapeNet and found that our OPNet outperformed this model on the instance retrieval task by a large margin. See Figure 2b in the paper.  There may be two reasons that the joint embedding approach does not perform as well as the OPNet. 1) Su et al. used the Light Field Descriptor(LFD) as anchor points for the joint embedding and used CNN only for image purification. So the distance among the LFD may not serve well for good similarity judgment; 2) Their application is more about recognizing 3D shapes from cluttered background, and we test the images without background. When Su et al. did compare the joint embedding approach with the Siamese network, the models were trained and tested with backgrounds which caused confusion to the Siamese network.  \n\nHowever, an important distinction between OPNet and Su et al\u2019s work is that our goal is to understand transferability of view-manifold learning to novel objects and novel categories that the system has not seen before. When tested with novel categories, such as synthesized objects or Pokemon (Figure 2c,d,e), the joint embedding approach does not perform well. The joint embedding approach needs to train the network for each specific category while our network can transfer view-manifold learning from learned categories to completely novel categories. Thus the joint embedding approach performs much worse on novel categories than our approach.  We would like to emphasize that the most novel contribution of our work is the transferability aspect of the learned view-manifold. Prior to our work, it is not clear that training with objects in one class will necessarily transfer the similarity judgment of objects to other classes, particularly to classes of unreal objects. The fact, on instance retrieval of \u201cnovel objects\u201d, i.e. given a novel object, find similar novel objects (assuming views of the same object, or objects of the same class would be considered similar),  OPNet can generalize much better than AlexNet and Joint Embedding, suggesting strong transferability of the learned view-manifold across object classes, which we attributed to the learning of some underlying universal parts. \n\n2. We have also evaluated OPNet in the instance retrieval task using features from different layers, as suggested by reviewer 1. We have explored both Euclidean distance and cosine distance for the AlexNet for comparison and found cosine distance worked better than Euclidean distance, so we compared the performance of the different layers using cosine distance. The results are shown in Table 1 as well as in the Appendix B in the paper. We found that feature representation in deeper layers give better results, except for the fc8 layer of AlexNet which indicated object categories. \n\n3. We have added references on related works in learning a generative 3D representation. Although all the references are related to our work in some technical aspects and goals, there is an important distinction.  Even though we used instance retrieval as a metric for evaluation technically, and might appear to be just like other computer vision work, the motivation of our project is to investigate what will take for a deep network to develop the ability of human-like similarity judgment of NOVEL objects or novel classes of objects not in the training set as in Tenanbaum\u2019s Science paper. The other works while related, did not investigate the transferability of view-manifold learning to different novel objects or novel classes of objects. Obviously, Siamese network and triplet cost is not new, and image retrieval of different views of 3D objects has also been intensely worked on. The novelty of our contribution is in the transferability of the view-manifold learning based on object persistence principle that allows our network to relate one novel object to other novel objects that we have never seen before. Image retrieval is just a method and precision-recall a metrics we used to measure this similarity judgment ability more systematically and comprehensively.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transfer of View-manifold Learning to Similarity Perception of Novel Objects", "abstract": "We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience.

Upon reviewer 3\u2019s advice, we evaluated the performance of our network on the real images in ALOI viewpoint dataset. The dataset contains 1000 different objects, each with different views. In the instance retrieval task, both OPNet and AlexNet exhibited transfer learning, but the improvement of our OPNet relative to AlexNet, is only in the order of 0.5% in the mean average precision.\n\nA problem of this dataset is that it does not have category labels so for the instance retrieval task we have to retrieve different views of the same object from all other 999 objects. OPNet\u2019s superiority over AlexNet lies in its capability of better discriminating among objects of the same category(e.g. discrimination between chair A and chair B, instead of between a chair and a cup). OPnet performs better when the distractors are more similar to the reference object, which is a harder situation. In the ALOI dataset, since the 1000 objects significantly differ from each other, this advantage cannot be brought out and thus OPnet achieves a comparable results with AlexNet.\n\nIn addition, real world images also have other properties such as lighting changes, reflectance and scale changes that are not considered in our training, but object persistence principle can generalize to take care of those nuisance variables. We added comments on this issue in the Final Discussion section of the revised paper.

The key insight is to use a triplet loss that encourages two different views of the same object to be closer than an image of a different object.

Furthermore, a comparison against human perception on the \"Tenenbaum objects\u201d is shown.\n\nPositives: Leveraging a triplet loss for this problem may have some novelty (although it may be somewhat limited given some concurrent work; see below).

We have actually cited Wang and Gupta\u2019s works, and in fact used the same Triplet Siamese network. In Wang and Gupta\u2019s work \u201cUnsupervised Learning of Visual Representations using Videos\u201d, they use visual tracking in the videos as supervision, forcing a similar representation for tracked patches of the same object. In a way, they did implicitly assume object persistence. But the change in views tend to be very limited in their case. Their main contribution was in demonstrating that they can learn \u201cfeature representation\u201d based on optical flow without explicit supervising object classification signals. Here, we modify the feature representation of AlexNet by asserting the similarity of different 3D views of the same object. The main contribution here is on \u201ctransferability\u201d of learning.\n\n2) In \"Multi-view Self-supervised Deep Learning for 6D Pose Estimation in the Amazon Picking Challenge by Zeng et al\u201d, the multi-view images, combined with spatial information, are used to calculate the background pixel, which then serves as a supervision for foreground segmentation and thus is different to our object persistency constraint.\n\nWe appreciate your advice for the clarification and we added the discussion on recent weak supervised works at the end of the introduction.
