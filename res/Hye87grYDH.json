The caption claims their model \"achieves the state-of-the-art performances in En-Vi and De-En\" but this is not true for De-En (albeit by 0.1). In Table 3, they boldface their result of 1.05 but the best result is 1.02; the text says their model beats the Transf-XL \"with an advantage\" (of 0.01) but do not point out that the advantage of Adaptive-span over their model is 3 times as large (0.03)).\n\nThis prevents me from recommending acceptance of this paper in its current form.

Since our model does not increase the number of parameters, the parameter quantities of the machine translation model are the same as the Transformer base and the Transformer large respectively on the IWSLT and WMT datasets.\n\nQ: The claim \"top layer of the vanilla Transformer focuses on the end position of the text\" can't be true generally. Probably only true for a certain task.\nA: we observe similar phenomena in other tasks, such as IWSLT German to English translation.\n\nQ: Where the numbers in Figure 1 come from? Is it a single attention head or average of all?\nA: For the sake of simplicity, we show the attention score of first head.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2212/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2212/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["1701214310@pku.edu.cn", "junyang.ljy@alibaba-inc.com", "zzy1210@pku.edu.cn", "renxc@pku.edu.cn", "xusun@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit Selection", "authors": ["Guangxiang Zhao", "Junyang Lin", "Zhiyuan Zhang", "Xuancheng Ren", "Xu Sun"], "pdf": "/pdf/334e12c721e66f3312c962bd610a2b8719c1613e.pdf", "TL;DR": "This work propose Sparse Transformer to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments for sequence to sequence learning.

Sparse Transformer: A modification of the Transformer, limiting attention to the top-k locations. (That is a complete statement of the proposed model.)\nC2. Experiments showing that, quantitatively, the Sparse Transformer out-performs the standard Transformer on translation, language modeling, and image captioning.\nC3. Experiments showing that, qualitatively, in translation, when generating a target word, the Sparse Transformer better focusses attention on the aligned source word \n\nRATING: Reject\n\nREASONS FOR RATING (SUMMARY). The innovativeness seems low given the several previous proposals for sparse attention, the results are not dramatic enough to compensate for the lack of originality, and the comparison to other models is wanting.\n\nREVIEW\n\nStrengths: The paper is clearly written. The question of whether the Transformer\u2019s attention is too diffuse is of interest. The proposal is admirably simple. The quantitative metrics include comparison against many alternative models.\n\nWeaknesses: A primary area of deficiency concerns the relation of the proposed model to other proposals for sparse attention: the authors cite 5 of them (and 2 more are cited in the comment by Cui). The paper should clearly identify the differences between the proposed model and earlier models: it does not discuss this at all. The deficiencies in these previous models should be clearly stated and demonstrated:  they are only described as \u201ceither restricted range of attention or training difficulty\u201d (Sec 6). A rationale for why the proposal can be expected to remedy these deficiencies should be stated clearly: it is not stated at all. Experimental demonstration that the proposed innovation actually remedies the identified deficiencies should be provided, but is not.\n\nA proposal to use a top-k filter immediately raises the question of the value of k. This is not discussed at all. In particular, no empirical results are given concerning the sensitivity of the reported successes to choosing the correct value for k. We are only told that \u201ck is usually a small number such as 5 or 10\u201d (Sec 3). The experimental details in the appendix do not even state the value of k used in the models reported.\n\nIt is an interesting discovery that in the translation task, attention at the top layer of the standard Transformer is strongly focused on the end of the input. This is described as an \u201cobvious problem\u201d (Sec 7). But it can\u2019t obviously be a problem because the performance of the standard Transformer is only very slightly lower than that of the Sparse Transformer: if anything is obvious, it is that processing in the standard Transformer packs a lot of information into its final encoding of the end of the input string, which functions rather like an encoding of the entire sentence.\n\nPresumably, the experimental results reported are those from a single model, since we are not told otherwise. There should be multiple tests of the models with different random initializations, with the means and variances of measures reported. It is possible, however, that limitations of computational resources made that infeasible, although the Appendix seems to indicate that no hyperparameter tuning was done, which greatly reduces computational cost.\n\nCOMMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENT, NOT RELEVANT TO RATING DECISION\n\nAlthough the tiny sample of visualized attention weights provided is useful, a large-scale quantitative assessment of a main claim concerning translation might well be possible: that attention is in fact concentrated on the aligned word might be testable using an aligned bilingual corpus or perhaps an existing forced aligner could be used.\n\nMuch space could be saved: it is not necessary to review the standard Transformer, and the modification proposed is so simple that it can be precisely stated in one sentence (see C1 above): the entire page taken up by Sec. 3 is unnecessary, as it adds only implementation details.\n\nErrors that took more than a moment to mentally correct, all on p. 12:\n\nThe definition of the BPC should be E[log P(x(t+1) | h(t))]: all parentheses are missing\n\u201cregrad\u201d should be \u201cregard\u201d\n\u201cderivative\u201d should be \u201cdifferentiable\u201d in the final sentence"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2212/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2212/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["1701214310@pku.edu.cn", "junyang.ljy@alibaba-inc.com", "zzy1210@pku.edu.cn", "renxc@pku.edu.cn", "xusun@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit Selection", "authors": ["Guangxiang Zhao", "Junyang Lin", "Zhiyuan Zhang", "Xuancheng Ren", "Xu Sun"], "pdf": "/pdf/334e12c721e66f3312c962bd610a2b8719c1613e.pdf", "TL;DR": "This work propose Sparse Transformer to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments for sequence to sequence learning.

What is the specific question/problem tackled by the paper?\n\nThe authors tackle the problem of sparse attention for various generative modeling tasks such as machine translation and image captioning. The main motivation behind studying this problem is the premise that sparse varieties of attention might generalize better than full attention. The authors propose a sparse attention mechanism based on the top-k selection where all attention values in a row are dropped if they are not higher than the k^{th} largest item in the row. Since this is a non-differentiable operation the authors propose to train this model by setting the gradients of the non-selected items to 0. The authors report results on machine translation, language modeling and image captioning.\n\n2. Is the approach well motivated, including being well-placed in the literature?\n\nIn my view the main reasons to study sparse variants of attention are either 1) scale to sequences longer than are possible with full attention (this is e.g., the motivation behind [1]) or 2) generalize better than full attention. The motivation of this work seems to be the latter as the authors claim improvements in terms of performance over full attention. The authors cite prior work on sparse attention mechanisms.\n\n3. Does the paper support the claims? This includes determining if results, whether theoretical or empirical, are correct and if they are scientifically rigorous.\n\nThe authors report good results on machine translation, showing that their sparse attention method improves performance on En-De to 29.4 BLEU, on De-En to 35.6 BLEU and on En-Vi to 31.1 BLEU, improving on full attention baselines. However, the authors have not submitted code for reproducing their results. The authors also do not report what choice of k is used for the top-k operation and how they made their choice of the optimal k? The paper would be well served by more ablation experiments demonstrating what the impact the choice of k has on the model performance. For example, I would expect to be able to reproduce original Transformer results using k = maximum sequence length. \n\nI am also not fully clear about how gradients are propagated through the top-k operation. It seems that if an index is not selected (i.e. it's attention value is smaller than top-k) it's gradient is set to 0. However, this seems problematic - for e.g., in the initial stages an important item might have a low attention value due to random initialization and might not make it to the top-k. Because of the way gradients are propagated it will not receive any gradient, and therefore will not be incentivized to increase its value. This doesn't seem like a good solution to me.\n\nSince the paper is mainly an empirical work, it would be improved by open-sourcing anonymized code so that it's results and claims may be verified. It would also be improved in more ablation experiments or explanations in what the optimal choice of k should be for the top-k and how that affects the results. \n\n[1] Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers by Child et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509)\n\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2212/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2212/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["1701214310@pku.edu.cn", "junyang.ljy@alibaba-inc.com", "zzy1210@pku.edu.cn", "renxc@pku.edu.cn", "xusun@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit Selection", "authors": ["Guangxiang Zhao", "Junyang Lin", "Zhiyuan Zhang", "Xuancheng Ren", "Xu Sun"], "pdf": "/pdf/334e12c721e66f3312c962bd610a2b8719c1613e.pdf", "TL;DR": "This work propose Sparse Transformer to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments for sequence to sequence learning.
