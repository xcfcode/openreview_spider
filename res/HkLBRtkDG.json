The investigated architectures are CNN, H-Net, G-CNN, DREN and OR-Net. It is found that all of these except H-Net show increased robustness to adversarial samples created by rotating or translating the input. At the same time H-Net does well against spatial transformer-based adversarial attacks.\n\nIt seems obvious that networks designed to be invariant to rotations would not suffer from rotation-based adversarial samples. However, because most networks tested only target equivariance to discretized rotations, the results are actually quite interesting / surprising.\n\nThe near-term practical significance of this work is limited, because an attacker is not limited to geometrical perturbations when generating adversarial samples, and equivariant networks are still vulnerable to vanilla adversarial samples. Still, this work may have something important to say, which is that perhaps adversarial samples can be thwarted if we can somehow (probably by some kind of unsupervised learning) learn the symmetries in the data, including higher-level non-geometric and local symmetries. In my opinion the paper could be much stronger if it spent some time discussing such implications of the findings.\n\nAfter looking at the DREN paper, I became a bit confused about the results in Table 1. I could be wrong, but it seems to me like the DREN paper is basically just explaining the 90-degree rotation version of a G-CNN in different notation. The cycle layer is called \u201cfirst layer group convolution\u201d in the G-CNN paper, and the isotonic layer is just a \u201cgroup convolution for higher layers\u201d. There is no decycle layer in the G-CNN paper, but it seems like its just equivalent to a sum-pooling plus planar convolution. That the two are equivalent is also supported by [1], which shows that any equivariant network is equivalent to a G-CNN. (This does not apply to OR-Net, because they use finer discretizations of the group convolution, or to H-Net, because they aim to be equivariant to continuous rotations.)\n\nIf this is correct, then the differences in the results between G-CNN and DREN must be due to a difference in architecture, model size, initialization, optimization, or something else that should be kept constant. Indeed it's not clear we even need to compare to DREN if this is correct.\n\nPros/cons:\n+ Somewhat surprising empirical findings\n+ Potential implications for future research on adversarial samples\n- Not useful \u201cin the wild\u201d right now (the authors did not claim it is)\n- Some confusing results regarding DREN / G-CNN\n\n[1] Kondor, Risi, and Shubhendu Trivedi. \u201cOn the Generalization of Equivariance and Convolution in Neural Networks to the Action of Compact Groups.\u201d\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Robustness of Rotation-Equivariant Networks to Adversarial Perturbations", "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: very small perturbations of the input having a dramatic impact on the predictions.
