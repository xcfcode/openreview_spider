The paper argues that it is too difficult to map directly from the description to a full program, so it instead formulates the synthesis in two parts. First, the description is mapped to a \"sketch\" (Y) containing high level program structure but no concrete details about, e.g., variable names. Afterwards, the sketch is converted into a full program (Prog) by stochastically filling in the abstract parts of the sketch with concrete instantiations.\n\nThe paper presents an abstraction method for converting a program into a sketch, a stochastic encoder-decoder model for converting descriptions to trees, and rejection sampling-like approach for converting sketches to programs. Experimentally, it is shown that using sketches as an intermediate abstraction outperforms directly mapping to the program AST. The data is derived from an online repository of ~1500 Android apps, and from that were extracted ~150k methods, which makes the data very respectable in terms of realisticness and scale. This is one of the strongest points of the paper.\n\nOne point I found confusing is how exactly the Combinatorial Concretization step works. Am I correct in understanding that this step depends only on Y, and that given Y, Prog is conditionally independent of X? If this is correct, how many Progs are consistent with a typical Y? Some additional discussion of why no learning is required for the P(Prog | Y) step would be appreciated.\n\nI'm also curious whether using a stochastic latent variable (Z) is necessary. Would the approach work as well using a more standard encoder-decoder model with determinstic Z?\n\nSome discussion of Grammar Variational Autoencoder (Kusner et al) would probably be appropriate.\n\nOverall, I really like the fact that this paper is aiming to do program synthesis on programs that are more like those found \"in the wild\". While the general pattern of mapping a specification to abstraction with a neural net and then mapping the abstraction to a full program with a combinatorial technique is not necessarily novel, I think this paper adds an interesting new take on the pattern (it has a very different abstraction than say, DeepCoder), and this paper is one of the more interesting recent papers on program synthesis using machine learning techniques, in my opinion.\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Sketch Learning for Conditional Program Generation", "abstract": "We study the problem of generating source code in a strongly typed,\nJava-like programming language, given a label (for example a set of\nAPI calls or types) carrying a small amount of information about the\ncode that is desired.

We answer your specific questions below.\n\nQuestion: Am I correct in understanding that [Combinatorial Concretization] step depends only on Y, and that given Y, Prog is conditionally independent of X? If this is correct, how many Progs are consistent with a typical Y?\n\nAnswer: Yes, Prog is conditionally independent of X given a sketch Y. In theory, there may be an infinite number of Progs for every Y. A simple example is two Progs that differ only in variable names, thereby corresponding to the same Y; for another example, there can be very many expressions that match the type of an API method argument. However, in practice, we use certain heuristics to limit the space of Progs from a given Y (these heuristics are abstractly captured by the distribution P(Prog | Y). In particular, these heuristics prioritize smaller, simpler programs over complex ones, and name local variables in a canonical way.\n\nWhile we didn't collect this data systematically, our experience with the system suggests that under the heuristics actually implemented in it, a typical Y leads to only ~5-10 distinct Progs in our experiments. We will collect this data more thoroughly and add it to the paper. \n\nQuestion: Some additional discussion of why no learning is required for the P(Prog | Y) step would be appreciated.\n\nAnswer: In principle, this step could be made data-driven; however, the resulting learning problem would be very difficult. This is because a single sketch used for training can correspond to many training programs that only differ in superficial details (for example local variable names). Learning to decide which differences between programs are superficial and which are not, solely by looking at the syntax of programs, is hard. In contrast, our approach of heuristically choosing P(Prog | Y) utilizes our domain knowledge of language semantics (for example, that local variable names do not matter, and that some algebraic expressions are semantically equivalent). This knowledge allows us to limit the set of programs that we end up generating. We will clarify this in more detail in the paper. \n\n\nQuestion: I'm also curious whether using a stochastic latent variable (Z) is necessary. Would the approach work as well using a more standard encoder-decoder model with deterministic Z?\n\nAnswer: The randomness associated with the latent variable Z serves as a way to regularize the learning process (a similar argument is made in the context of VAEs for the stochastic latent variable used during VAE learning). We were concerned that without the stochasticity (i.e., with a deterministic Z), training the model would be more likely to be affected by overfitting. Practically speaking, the stochasticity also serves as a way to ensure that we can generate a wide variety of possible programs from a given X. If Z was not random, a particular set of labels X will always result in exactly the same value of Z.\n\nComment: Some discussion of Grammar Variational Autoencoder (Kusner et al) would probably be appropriate.\n\nAnswer: Kusner et al\u2019s work proposes a VAE for context-free grammars. Being an auto-encoder it is a generative model, but it is not a conditional model such as ours. In their application towards synthesizing molecular structures, given a particular molecular structure, their model can be used to search the latent space for similar valid structures. In our setting, however, we are not given a sketch but only labels about the sketch, and our task is learn a conditional model that can predict a whole sketch given labels.\n\nWe will add the discussion about this work in the final version of the paper.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Sketch Learning for Conditional Program Generation", "abstract": "We study the problem of generating source code in a strongly typed,\nJava-like programming language, given a label (for example a set of\nAPI calls or types) carrying a small amount of information about the\ncode that is desired.
