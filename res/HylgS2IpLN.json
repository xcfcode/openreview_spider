I learned a great deal from reading it!  \n\nNotes: \n  -Reproducibility is especially important in health due to safety concerns.  \n  -Review of 100 ML4H research papers relating to reproducibility\n  -ML4H has more issues with data and code access.  \n  -Proposes recommendations to make research more reproducible.  \n  -In 2018, 12 healthcare tools using ML got FDA clearance.  (cool!)\n  -Quantitative and qualitative review showing ML4H has worse code availability data availability and dataset variety than other ML subfields.  \n  -The choice of evaluation metrics is reasonable but a bit limited.  \n  -Privacy issues make it difficult to release health data publicly.  \n  -ML4H papers are more likely to report mean/stdv than other fields in ML.  \n  -Only 19% of ML4H studies used multiple datasets.  \n  -The issue of preregistration in ML is interesting.  \n  \nComments / questions: \n  -Does failure to reproduce basic research papers in ML4H really lead to problems for production health systems?  Presumably there are many steps of validation beyond the basic research papers.  \n  -I really like the reproducibility taxonomy: technical, statistical, and conceptual reproducibility.  Technical reproducibility refers to getting the exact results, so includes things like implementation.  Statistical reproducibility is equivalence but only up to the statistical properties being the same (so the results follow the same distribution).  Conceptual reproducibility means that the idea works as long as the concept is preserved.  \n  -Figure 1 is quite nice\n", "rating": "5: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML/Paper7/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Reproducibility in Machine Learning for Health", "authors": ["Anonymous"], "authorids": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/RML/Paper7/Authors"], "keywords": ["reproducibility", "ML4H", "health", "systematic review", "replicability", "data access"], "TL;DR": "By analyzing more than 300 papers in recent machine learning conferences, we found that Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) applications lag behind other machine learning fields in terms of reproducibility metrics.", "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms designed to characterize, monitor, and intervene on human health (ML4H) are expected to perform safely and reliably when operating at scale, potentially outside strict human supervision.
