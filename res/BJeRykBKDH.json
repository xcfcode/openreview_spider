In the revision of the paper we submitted just now, we also include results on two standard graph classification datasets (D&D/PROTEINS; Section 5). In both of these kinds of datasets, it can be observed that no known way of \u201cpairing\u201d the graph structures is given, yet our methodology manages to extract additional benefits compared to its respective baseline GNN.\n\nTo answer your questions in turn (we are very open to further discussions, of course):\n\n1. We would like to confirm that, indeed, we do leverage one-hot encodings of the atom type (as is common practice in the MPNN paper, for example). Effectively, a separate vector representation is learnt for each atom in this way. We found this to be a critical component to the performances we obtained on the computational chemistry datasets. Thank you for pointing this out to us -- we are now making it more clear in the (just submitted) revision of the paper.\n\n2. Currently, we seek to encode all bond types as discrete (one-hot) representations. The approach is typically to assume \u201cspecial\u201d edge types for bonds that are situated in e.g. a benzene ring, (to specify that they are not quite e.g. single or double bonds).\n\n3. \na) We provided some loose guidelines on choosing K in the paper -- generally, choosing any K > 1 will yield benefits compared to self-pairing and other K = 1 variants. From there, the differences are more fine-grained and depend on the chemical property being predicted---but the overall performance does not change drastically.\n\nb) We would like to note that we have now updated the QM9 prediction MAEs to match unscaled values. Unfortunately, a direct comparison of our work with previously published numbers is extremely difficult, given that different manuscripts utilise different scales of the output labels (e.g. Gilmer et al. incorporate a ratio to the DFT chemical accuracy). In addition, our architecture aims to predict all molecular properties simultaneously, which is not comparable to training individual models for every property (as done by Gilmer et al., for example). With this in mind, we note that the (K = 1, self) model is, in terms of data flow between the atom representations, equivalent to the state-of-the-art MPNN model of Gilmer et al.\n\nThank you very much for your review, which has certainly helped make our contributions stronger!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1487/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1487/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["deacandr@mila.quebec", "huang.yu-hsiang@courrier.uqam.ca", "petar.velickovic@cst.cam.ac.uk", "pl219@cam.ac.uk", "jian.tang@hec.ca"], "title": "Empowering Graph Representation Learning with Paired Training and Graph Co-Attention", "authors": ["Andreea Deac", "Yu-Hsiang Huang", "Petar Velickovic", "Pietro Lio", "Jian Tang"], "pdf": "/pdf/3121a2282e0036dcec026041303b77761c59e75f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We use graph co-attention in a paired graph training system for graph classification and regression.", "abstract": "Through many recent advances in graph representation learning, performance achieved on tasks involving graph-structured data has substantially increased in recent years---mostly on tasks involving node-level predictions.

Feeding graphs pairwisely into the model allows nodes to easily exchange information with nodes in other graphs as well as within the graph. This method outperforms other previous ones on a pairwise graph classification task (drug-drug interaction prediction).\nThis model is generalized from Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry (Justin Gilmer et al.) and Graph Attention Networks (Petar Velickovic et al.), but most ideas are directly from the two previous papers. Combining the two methods do provide insights into understanding the interactions between graphs and get really good results on DDI prediction, but the novelty is limited.\nQuestions:\n1 Are atoms encoded as only atom numbers, charges and connected hydrogen atoms? Because some atoms might have much larger atom numbers than others, e.g. carbon (6) and sulfur (16), will there be some scale problems? Will one-hot encoding of atom type help (like in Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry)?\n2 According to the paper, bond types will be encoded as e_{ij}. But in molecules, bond type is way more complex than only single/double/triple bonds, especially for drug molecules which are enriched for aromatic systems. For example, bonds in benzene or pyridine rings are between single and double (also not necessarily 3/2). Are there other possible methods to encode graph edges?\n3 In result table 2 of Section 4 (quantum chemistry), I didn\u2019t see a principle of choosing K value and choosing neighbors because different properties reaches the lowest MAE at different K values. This might cause some confusion in real application. Moreover, the authors should compare the performance with previous methods.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1487/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1487/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["deacandr@mila.quebec", "huang.yu-hsiang@courrier.uqam.ca", "petar.velickovic@cst.cam.ac.uk", "pl219@cam.ac.uk", "jian.tang@hec.ca"], "title": "Empowering Graph Representation Learning with Paired Training and Graph Co-Attention", "authors": ["Andreea Deac", "Yu-Hsiang Huang", "Petar Velickovic", "Pietro Lio", "Jian Tang"], "pdf": "/pdf/3121a2282e0036dcec026041303b77761c59e75f.pdf", "TL;DR": "We use graph co-attention in a paired graph training system for graph classification and regression.", "abstract": "Through many recent advances in graph representation learning, performance achieved on tasks involving graph-structured data has substantially increased in recent years---mostly on tasks involving node-level predictions.
