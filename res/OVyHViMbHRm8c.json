The method used two major ingredients: 1. a sliding window of histograms (called sliding spatial pyramid matching) , 2. randomized vocabularies to generate different models and combine them. The authors claimed that, using only one image feature (transformed color SIFT), the method achieved really good results on Caltech101. \r\n\r\n\r\nAssessment of novelty and quality: \r\n\r\nThough the accuracy looks impressive, the paper offers limited research value to the machine learning community. The success is largely engineering, lacking insights that are informative to readers. \r\n\r\nThe sliding window representation does not explore multiple scales. Therefore  I don't understand why it is still called 'pyramid'. \r\n\r\nI hope the authors would try the methods on large-scale datasets like ImageNet. If good result obtained, then the work will be of great value to application."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Visual Objects Classification with Sliding Spatial Pyramid Matching", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "We present a method for visual object classification using only a single feature, transformed color SIFT with a variant of Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) that we called Sliding Spatial Pyramid Matching (SSPM), trained with an ensemble of linear regression (provided by LINEAR) to obtained state of the art result on Caltech-101 of 83.46%.
