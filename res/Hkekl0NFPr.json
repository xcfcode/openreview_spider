The authors show both theoretically and empirically that the proposed algorithm show better utility-fairness tradeoff on balanced datasets. This is indeed a useful result. Overall, I liked the presentation of the paper including motivation and background of other methods. Theory is sound, and experiments are sufficient.   Therefore, I do not have any major concern. Some of minor concerns are mentioned below:\n\n1. I see some ambiguity in the definition of the classifiers. h is defined to be deterministic in section 2; whereas, later \\hat{Y}, which I believe is treated at h(g(x)) for some h, is taken to be randomized. Also, the theorems are mentioned with respect to h making them specific to deterministic classifiers according to the current definition.\n\n2. I am not sure why the last statement of the second last paragraph on page 2 is true. Can you please explain? There should be an additional condition on distribution D, which is not clear at that moment in the paper.\n\n3. I am wondering if the utility can be maintained for imbalanced datasets by taking two parameters \\lambda_1 and \\lambda_2 for BER_{D^0} and BER_{D^1} in equation 2. Did the authors check when we have different regularization parameters for both terms? If yes, then what was the conclusion?\n\n4. Please write theorems as fully independent statements. \"Assume the conditions in Proposition 3.2\" is probably not the right way to start a theorem. Other way is to mention the conditions separately and then use it throughout the paper.\n\n5. Can you please write or elaborate the final optimization problem after section 3.4?\n\n6. How did the authors construct the optimal classifiers in the experiments for real data? Can you provide some details?\n\nTypo: \"sensitive attribute A, then the second term\" --> remove then\n\n----  After Rebuttal ---\n\nI thank the authors for providing response to my questions.

I have increased my score. However I'd be nice to also see the balanced accuracy (i.e. sum of TPRs for each class divided by 2) results and compare to baseline trained with oversampling or re-weighted loss.\n\nI would suggest authors to add more extensive comparisons to other methods using Adult dataset. There are quite a lot of papers in the fairness literature that experiment with the Adult dataset. They focus on different metrics and there is probably no method that is uniformly the best. Your paper demonstrated that your approach can succeed in achieving accuracy parity, but it would be good to also show tradeoffs with other metrics (in addition to DP). I was able to do some back-of-the-envelop calculations and your results seem fine, but a clear comparison would be good.\n\nBelow are some examples of the papers studying Adult dataset from the fairness angle:\n[1] Mitigating unwanted biases with adversarial learning. Zhang et al., 2018. (already cited, but no comparison)\n[2] What\u2019s in a Name? Reducing Bias in Bios without Access to Protected Attributes. Romanov et al., 2019.\n[3] Learning fair predictors with Sensitive Subspace Robustness. Yurochkin et al., 2019.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis paper proposes an adversarial representation learning approach. The key difference with prior work is that the objective function is built around balanced error rates, one for classes, that is eventually used for classification, and two adversarial for predicting each of the protected attributes. Authors argue that proposed approach can simultaneously achieve accuracy parity and equalized odds.\n\nThe notion of accuracy parity does not seem to be very meaningful. For example, predicting uniformly at random seems like an intuitively fair classifier with EO gap 0 and DP gap 0. However it will not necessarily have error gap of 0 (i.e. satisfy accuracy parity), making me wonder if the notion of accuracy parity makes much sense.\n\nI am not really sure what is the Err0 + Err1 metric used in Figures 1 and 2. Is it not normalized and can vary between 0 and 2? In which case it seems counterintuitive for performance quantification. If it is normalized, then results on COMPAS do not make sense. Err0 + Err1 of all methods is above 60%, which is worse than predicting uniformly at random.\n\nPlease report your TPRs for classes grouped by protected attribute when reporting the results in the context of group fairness. Further for Adult dataset, reporting balanced TPR as a measure of accuracy seems to make more sense given the class imbalance.\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Learning of Fair Representations", "authors": ["Han Zhao", "Amanda Coston", "Tameem Adel", "Geoffrey J.

On the other hand, since larger $\\lambda$ corresponds to focusing \nmore on aligning the features, this causes the overall TPR to gradually go down, which appear in both CFair and CFair-EO. \n\nNow if we compare CFair-EO and CFair with the baseline NoDebias, we see that both the TPR | A = 0 and TPR | A = 1 of CFair are much higher than that of the baseline, whereas these two metrics are roughly the same in \nCFair-EO. Why this happens? This is precisely because we use the balanced error rate (BER) as our objective function in CFair. As we can see from Table 1, the Adult data has very skewed distribution in terms of the target label $Y$. In this case,\nthe balanced error rate will help to put equal footing on errors from instances with labels $Y = 1$ and $Y = 0$. On the other hand, since both NoDebias and CFair-EO use the original global cross-entropy loss as the objective function, and the fact that \nthe marginal distribution of $Y = 1$ is only around $10\\%$ in the dataset, the TPR for these two methods are much lower. \n\nAgain, we thank the reviewer's time and efforts for the comment and we hope our response and new experimental results help address your concerns. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Learning of Fair Representations", "authors": ["Han Zhao", "Amanda Coston", "Tameem Adel", "Geoffrey J.

However, if we consider another \"fair\" classifier always predicting 1, then error gap is 0 only if probability of 1 is same across protected groups, which is often not the case. I also briefly went through some references you suggested, in particular [6] cites [3] for \"Overall accuracy equality\" and [3] in turn says \"Overall accuracy equality is not commonly used because it does not distinguish between accuracy for successes and accuracy for failures\". [1] seems to focus on disparate impact, i.e. eq. (1) in their paper (which would categorize an \"always 1\" classifier as fair) - could you please clarify where they study accuracy parity?\n\nWhile I still remain unconvinced that accuracy parity is preferable to other fairness notions, I acknowledge that this paper makes a contribution in the direction of improving fairness in ML. I'd be willing to increase my score if you could provide the TPRs by gender (not gaps) and overall balanced accuracy for the Adult dataset. The reason I am asking for these results is that TPR for females on Adult dataset is typically quite low when using a classifier without fairness considerations, however some results reported in the literature appear to \"fix\" the problem by essentially making TPR for males significantly lower. Accuracy at the same time does not seem to decrease by a lot because the overall proportion of the \">50k\" class is small.

We would like to answer your questions below.\n\n# Deterministic/Randomized Classifiers\nYes, $\\widehat{Y} = h(g(X))$, but the hypothesis $h(\\cdot)$ defined in this work could be randomized, as long as the randomness is independent of $Y$. The only requirement here is that $h(\\cdot)\\in\\{0, 1\\}$. One way to think about this is that $h = h(R(g(X)), \\epsilon)$, where $R(g(X))\\in[0, 1]$ is a score function and $\\epsilon\\sim U(0, 1)$ is uniformly random variable, and $h(\\cdot) = 1$ iff $\\epsilon \\leq R(g(X))$. \n\n# Last statement of the second last paragraph\nNote that here since $Y\\in\\{0, 1\\}$, so we know $\\mathcal{D}(Y)$ is a binary distribution. We use $\\mathcal{D}(Y)$ to denote the marginal distribution of $Y$ from the joint distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. The rest follows from the definition of total variation and $\\Delta_{\\text{BR}}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$. \n\n# Different Regularization parameters\nThanks for the invaluable suggestion! We attributed the utility loss on imbalanced data to the first term of the objective function instead of the BER_{D^0} and BER_{D^1} terms. To see this, let's compare the blue curve and the green curve in the fourth plot of Figure 1. Note that the blue curve has less utility loss compared with the green one, and the only difference here is that the green curve corresponds to $BER_D(\\widehat{Y} || Y)$ while the blue one corresponds to the usual cross-entropy loss. BER_{D^0} and BER_{D^1} terms are shared in both curves. \n\n\nNevertheless, we performed additional experiments to valid the effects of different regularization parameters for BER_{D^0} and BER_{D^1}. Specifically, since the marginal distribution of Y = 1 roughly equals 0.25 in the Adult dataset, we use $0.5\\lambda$ for BER_{D^0} and $1.5\\lambda$ for BER_{D^1} with varying $\\lambda$. The results are shown as follows:\n                                                    $\\lambda = 0.1$     $\\lambda = 1.0$     $\\lambda = 10.0$    $\\lambda = 100.0$   $\\lambda = 1000.0$ \nCFair, Err0 + Err1 ($0.5\\lambda$, $1.5\\lambda$):    0.3655441681        0.3687420002        0.4167540332        0.4677270783        0.5498600632\nCFair, Err0 + Err1 ($\\lambda$, $\\lambda$):          0.3641129377        0.3886518694        0.4138039334        0.4803962055        0.5368310545\nCFair-EO, Err0 + Err1 ($\\lambda$, $\\lambda$):       0.2954339377        0.287374556         0.2879574589        0.3122427609        0.3236335696\n\nFrom the above experimental results, we can confirm that even with different regularization parameters for BER_{D^0} and BER_{D^1}, the utility loss is roughly the same as the one with the same regularization parameters, and both of them are worse than CFair-EO (blue curve), which is mainly due to that CFair-EO uses the normal cross-entropy loss as target loss instead of the balanced error rate. \n\n# Proposition 3.2 and Optimization formulation\nThanks for the suggestion, and we have updated the manuscript accordingly. The details about the final optimization objective function can now be found in Section 3.4.\n\n# Construction of the optimal classifier\nThe details of the classifier and the optimization algorithm are described at the end of Section 4.1 and Appendix B. In a nutshell, we use simultaneous gradient update to implement the gradient descent-ascent algorithm to optimize the target classifier until convergence. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Learning of Fair Representations", "authors": ["Han Zhao", "Amanda Coston", "Tameem Adel", "Geoffrey J.

This implies that the errors of $\\widehat{Y}$ on both demographic subgroups will be 1/2, leading to accuracy parity by definition. \n\nFurthermore, the notion of accuracy parity has been widely discussed and used in the literature as a principle to design fair algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this dates at least back to 2015 by Zafar et al. [1], and has received increasing attention since then [2-4, 7]. See [6, Table 1] for a thorough investigation on this topic. In fact, as demonstrated by researchers from MIT Media Lab and Microsoft Research [5], three widely used commercial face recognition systems exhibit substantial accuracy disparities between four groups: darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males. This result has already brought huge public attention [8-10] and calls for commercial face recognition systems that (at least approximately) satisfy accuracy parity. \n\nLast but not least, from a theoretical point of view, it is well-known that any two of the three fairness definitions (DP, EO, Predictive Rate Parity) cannot hold simultaneously except in degenerate cases [11]. Nevertheless, accuracy parity is free of such inherent incompatibility, and we believe it's both interesting (from a theoretical standpoint) and urgent (from a practical viewpoint) to have algorithms that can achieve both accuracy parity and equalized odds. \n\n[1].

The metric Err0 + Err1 shown in Figure 1 and 2 is not normalized, but all the curves in the last plot share this same metric, so we believe they still provide a fair comparison among these different algorithms. The main reason we use this metric is that we would like it to be consistent with the theoretical result presented in Theorem 2.1, which precisely gives a lower bound in terms of Err0 + Err1.\n\n\n# True Positive Rate \nTrue positive rate parity corresponds to a sub-case of equalized odds known as equality of opportunity, which essentially reduces to our definition $\\Delta_{\\text{EO}}(\\widehat{Y})$ when only $y = 1$ is considered (see Definition 3.3). Hence it is clear that our metric of $\\Delta_{\\text{EO}}(\\widehat{Y})$ is actually more stringent than TPR parity since it's an upper bound of the TPR gap. The results on this could be found in the second plot of Figure 1 and 2. \n\n\nWe hope our response has answered the reviewer's questions and helped further clarify the description and contribution of our work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper913/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Conditional Learning of Fair Representations", "authors": ["Han Zhao", "Amanda Coston", "Tameem Adel", "Geoffrey J.

We attempt to answer your questions below. \n\n# Min-max problem\nYes, our architecture essentially contains 4 parts, including one feature transformation component, one task classifier, and two adversarial classifiers, one for conditional distribution of $Y = 0$ and the other for $Y = 1$. \n\n# Experiments \nWe carefully design our experiments to contain two datasets, one balanced and one imbalanced, to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm versus other approaches on these two datasets. Both the Adult and the COMPAS datesets are widely used in the literature for classification problems, which is the main focus of this work. We believe our current experiments are sufficient to demonstrate our theory (as commented by R2) and we anticipate similar experimental conclusions could be observed on other tasks as well. For example, both [1] and [2] consider and use these two datasets for empirical verifications of the corresponding methods proposed therein.\n\n# Balanced Error Rate\nYes, we fully agree with the reviewer that there are many other convex relaxations of the intractable balanced error rate function besides the one used in our work, and we are happy to cite this work and have a discussion on it. \n\n# Multiple Groups\nThe proposed algorithm could be easily extended to work under the setting where there are multiple sensitive attributes: we can simply define a new sensitive attribute that is the direct product of all the existing sensitive attributes. However, this will still lead to a sensitive attribute that contains exclusive memberships. A naive extension that also works for intersecting sensitive attributes is to add two more BER terms for each new sensitive attribute. However, this will inevitably lead to tradeoffs between multiple sensitive attributes, since they could be correlated by themselves. \n\n[1].

The experiments demonstrate utility of the algorithm for balanced datasets (without sacrificing performance to fairness)\n\nDisclaimer: I am completely out of this area\nBut it is an easy read and an interesting angle. Authors show that simple modification of the loss makes it more fair (in a sense).  The experiments are somewhat thin.\n\nMin max problem in Section 3 - I think it requires more intro for people outside. I assume you use an architecture that extracts the representation and has two head (outputs) - h and h'. For a modified loss, do you have 3 outputs - h, h' and h''? A pic with an architecture would be really helpful\n\nProbably more datasets are required to have a more convincing empirical story\n\nSection 3.4: Even though you can't directly optimize for BER, there are ways that can work, instead of just replacing it with CE, for example this https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04802.pdf\n\nOne critique is based on 3.4 I don't understand  how can this be extended to multiple axis of intersecting groups- e.g. not just mutually exclusive race values, but also gender for example.
