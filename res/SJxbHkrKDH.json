I believe the changes increase the significance of the contribution and may help it reach a broader audience.\n\n--\nThis paper proposes evolving curriculums of increasing populations of agents to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning with large number of agents. The topic is of relevance to the ICLR community and the results are tending towards publishable contributions, but I have some concerns that I would like the authors to discuss in their rebuttal.\n\nThe method is evaluated on a good range of suitably challenging environments. However, why did the authors propose new challenges within the particle environments and not those used in the original publication? This change makes it harder to compare results across publications, whilst not seeming to add a significant change in the learning problem beyond what was present in the original benchmark tasks. The food collection task sounds like it may be equivalent to simple spread. Will the new environments be released as open source for others to build upon this work? \n\nThe method is compared against a good range of baseline methods and ablations of the proposed method. However, without grounding the results in a known environment it is hard to place whether the implementations of MADDPG and Mean-Field are fair reproductions. Presuming the authors are using the open source implementation of MADDPG (please confirm) this is most significant for Mean-Field particularly given its poor performance in Section 5.4. Please provide evidence that this is a fair comparison.\n\nTo evaluate the resultant agents in the competitive environments, all methods were placed into games against the authors proposed EPC method. Was this the same EPC opponents the evaluated EPC team were trained against? If so, this is an unfair advantage to the EPC team as it has time to optimize against this opponent whilst the other methods have not. Even if it is an EPC team from a different training run, there may be outstanding biases in the joint policies EPC tends towards that benefit the EPC team evaluated. This could be overcome by evaluating all methods in competition with all other methods.\n\nFor all experimental results, please quantify variance in performance as well as average value (currently only done in Figure 9 a and b). How many repeats of evaluation and training were performed for each? Without these details the claim on page 9 that \"EPC is always the best among all the approaches with a clear margin\" is too strong. Are these differences statistically significant? Additionally, please also include the maximum scores (where normalized score = 1.0) for all experiments, as presenting results with only normalized scores unnecessarily reduces the reproducibility of the work. \n\nFinally, in Appendix B, the authors provide a list of hyperparameter settings without discussion of how these were chosen. Were they optimised for one specific method or set to defaults from the literature? In particular, as the performance of Att-MADDPG is still improving at the end of the plot in Figure 9e, I am concerned that the #episodes was chosen to optimise the performance of EPC.\n\nOverall, this is an interesting approach with promising initial results. I believe the contribution would be significantly improved by addressing the issues above and look forward to the authors responses which could increase my rating to acceptance.\n\nThings that could improve the paper but did not impact the score:\n1) On page 5 it is noted that the authors do not share parameters between the Q-function and policy. It would improve the paper to justify why this choice was made.\n2) Page 5: \"N_1 agents for of the role\" -> N_1 agents of the role\n3) Page 5: \"as follows to evolved these K parallel sets\" -> evolve\n4) Page 7: \"resources asThank yoTha green landmarks\"\n5) Page 8: \"understand how the trained sheep behavior in the game\" -> how the trained sheep behave in the game\n6) Page 14: There are repeated grammatical issues in Appendix A e.g. \"is more closer to grass / sheep / other agents\" -> is closer to grass / sheep / other agents and \"will less negative reward\" -> will receive less negative rewards", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1681/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1681/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Qian Long*", "Zihan Zhou*", "Abhinav Gupta", "Fei Fang", "Yi Wu\u2020", "Xiaolong Wang\u2020"], "authorids": ["qianlong@cs.cmu.edu", "footoredo@sjtu.edu.cn", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu", "feif@cs.cmu.edu", "jxwuyi@gmail.com", "dragonwxl123@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["multi-agent reinforcement learning", "evolutionary learning", "curriculum learning"], "abstract": "In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large.

(2017) is the first population-based training paper from Google which boosts the performance of many benchmark tasks by running evolution on hyper-parameter tuning.\n> Houthooft et al. (2018) propose to directly run evolution to learn a neural loss function to replace the PG loss, which is extremely expensive, but experiments on small single-agent tasks show that policies learn by the evolved loss can generalize better.\n> Khadka et al. (2018) run population-based training and off-policy RL training together to leverage the diverse samples collected by the population to improve off-policy learning.\n> Conti et al. (2018) proposed an improved exploration technique for running evolution algorithm in RL.\n\nThanks for mentioning the Capture-The-Flag paper (Jaderberg et al. 2018) from Google. It uses exactly the same training framework from Jaderberg et al. (2017) to solve the game. Particularly, 30 agents are trained as a population and the evolution algorithm is performed to tune each agent\u2019s intrinsic reward to overcome the sparse success reward of the game.  While in our work, we use evolution to tackle the objective misalignment challenge when the number of agents is increased. These are two very different problems of interest. We have cited this paper in the revision. Notably, even in this mentioned paper, there is no direct comparison with any evolution references. Instead, the proposed method is compared with only two baselines, i.e., (1) pure self-play + sparse reward and (2) self-pay + hand-tuned intrinsic rewards.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1681/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1681/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Qian Long*", "Zihan Zhou*", "Abhinav Gupta", "Fei Fang", "Yi Wu\u2020", "Xiaolong Wang\u2020"], "authorids": ["qianlong@cs.cmu.edu", "footoredo@sjtu.edu.cn", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu", "feif@cs.cmu.edu", "jxwuyi@gmail.com", "dragonwxl123@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["multi-agent reinforcement learning", "evolutionary learning", "curriculum learning"], "abstract": "In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large.

In fact, each of the three environments is either from or slightly adapted from standard benchmarks. We pick two games suitable for many agents from the MADDPG game suites and one from the mean-field MARL paper. We have clarified this in Appendix A in the revision. \n\nThe Food Collection game is exactly the same as simple-spread in the original MADDPG paper. \n\nThe Grassland Game is a slightly enhanced version of the original predator-prey game in the MADDPG paper, with two enhancements to make it more challenging: (1) agents can die; (2) there are resources. \n\nThe Adversarial-Battle game is adapted from the mean-field MARL paper. It is the only high-dimensional experiment in the mean-field paper. The original environment is (1) a grid world and (2) every single agent can kill an enemy (this makes the problem easy since agents need little coordination). We convert it to the particle-world environment with food and further constraint that only two agents can kill an enemy.\n\nBesides, we also add another experiment on the original predator-prey game in Appendix E in the updated paper and all of our conclusions still hold.\n\n\n\u2014- \u201cPlease provide evidence that this is a fair comparison\u201d\n>>> Our MADDPG implementation is based on the open-source code of MADDPG from OpenAI. \n\nFor mean-field, we have carefully studied their open-source implementation and tried our best to re-implement their algorithm within the MADDPG framework (their code is on Q-learning). We have even obtained confirmation directly from the authors on all our implementation details. \n\nThe poor performance of mean-field does not surprise us for the following reasons:\n1. In their original paper, it states that \u201cWe exclude MADDPG as baselines, as the framework of centralized critic cannot deal with the varying number of agents for the battle\u201d. That is, they only compared with single-agent RL baselines but *did NOT compare with MADDPG* at all. We think this comparison can be simply conducted by masking out dead agents (i.e., set them 0). So, we present this missing result in our paper. \n2. Mean-field takes the average actions of only *nearby* agents within a hand-tuned distance. As we discussed in the introduction, its fundamental assumption is that the Q function can be *linearly approximated by local interactions* (they use Taylor expansion in the proof), which is not guaranteed in many games requiring complex distant coordinations. This is why it performs significantly poor in Food Collection (as we discussed in the texts below fig.8) while on a par with MADDPG in the other two games. Notably, mean-field was not tested in any high-dimensional games other than the grid-world battle game in their original paper.\n \n\n\u2014- \u201call methods were placed against the EPC method\u201d\n>>> We have included the full pairwise competition results in Appendix D.3 in our revision. We show the rewards by competing against every two methods. This pairwise results show that EPC is consistently better than baselines. \n\nThe purpose of the histograms is to show that EPC can \u201cdefeat\u201d opponents trained by other methods. The reason for just showing the results against EPC in the main paper is solely for visualization simplicity (since we have 5 methods to compare).\n\n\n\u2014- \u201cplease quantify variance ... How many repeats ...\u201d\n>>> For evaluation, as in Appendix C, we run 10000 games to compute each normalized score.  \n\nFor training, we have included training variance for all methods in fig 9 over 3 seeds (baselines are trained much longer and the full curves are in Appendix D.1).\nFor the main results (Fig. 6,7,8), we only did 1 training seed at submission time (similar to the MADDPG paper). Although the training is empirically stable, we agree that it would be better to repeat the training process and include variance. For now, due to compute and time limit, we presented the variance for food collection game in Appendix D.4, which again shows consistent results. We promise to include variance results for all the games in the final version.\n\nWe also include the raw reward numbers for Fig. 6,7,8 in Appendix D.2. \n\n\n\u2014- \u201chyperparameter settings without discussion\u201d\n>>> All hyper-parameters for the MADDPG algorithm are exactly the same as the original MADDPG paper (clarified in Appendix B).\nFor the number of iterations, all baselines are trained for a number of episodes that equals the *accumulative* episodes EPC has taken. The purpose of Fig 9(def) is simply showing the *transfer* performance, i.e., the initialization produced by EPC from the previous stage is effective and can indeed leverage past experiences to warm-start. The x-axis of the plot is actually shrunk (Att-MADDPG is trained much longer than one curriculum stage of EPC).

Specifically, the procedures (EPC) involves starting with a small number of agents, training multiple sets in parallel, and doing crossover to find the set of agents that generalize best to a larger number of agents. This is motivated by the intuition that agents that perform best in small groups may not be the ones that perform best in larger groups. These claims are empirically verified in three games based on the particle world set of environments. \n\nI\u2019m a fan of \u2018automatic curriculum learning\u2019-style methods designed to gradually add complexity to improve final agent performance, and this paper is no exception. The proposed method is simple, but it makes sense. I like the fact that it is both RL algorithm agnostic, and that it can be largely executed in parallel, which means that it introduces only small training time overhead. I also like the proposed method of making the Q function agnostic to the number of agents and entities using attention (although whether these policies incorporate information from previous time steps, or if they can be made to do so). The experimental results are thorough, comparing to MADDPG, a simpler version of their curriculum without evolution, and a recently proposed method for scaling up MADDPG, showing that EPC consistently outperforms all of them, and is more stable. I think the complexity of the environments is also suitable for this style of paper, although it would be nice to see results in a more open and complex domain such as the recent NeuralMMO game.\n\nOverall, I think this is a good paper and I recommend acceptance.  \n\n\nSmall fixes:\n-\t\u2018asThank yoTha\u2019 -> not sure what this means\n-\tN1 agents for of role 1 -> N1 agents of role 1\n-\t\u201cWe adopt the decentralized learning framework\u201d --- even if each agent has their own Q function, if that Q function is centralized (uses the observation of all agents) then training is still centralized \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1681/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1681/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Evolutionary Population Curriculum for Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Qian Long*", "Zihan Zhou*", "Abhinav Gupta", "Fei Fang", "Yi Wu\u2020", "Xiaolong Wang\u2020"], "authorids": ["qianlong@cs.cmu.edu", "footoredo@sjtu.edu.cn", "abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu", "feif@cs.cmu.edu", "jxwuyi@gmail.com", "dragonwxl123@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["multi-agent reinforcement learning", "evolutionary learning", "curriculum learning"], "abstract": "In multi-agent games, the complexity of the environment can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases, so it is particularly challenging to learn good policies when the agent population is large. In this paper, we introduce Evolutionary Population Curriculum (EPC), a curriculum learning paradigm that scales up Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by progressively increasing the population of training agents in a stage-wise manner. Furthermore, EPC uses an evolutionary approach to fix an objective misalignment issue throughout the curriculum: agents successfully trained in an early stage with a small population are not necessarily the best candidates for adapting to later stages with scaled populations. Concretely, EPC maintains multiple sets of agents in each stage, performs mix-and-match and fine-tuning over these sets and promotes the sets of agents with the best adaptability to the next stage. We implement EPC on a popular MARL algorithm, MADDPG, and empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin as the number of agents grows exponentially.
