All other methods except ACET fail with AUC values below 20%. \n\nPlease note that due to a change in Pytorch we had to retrain all models in order to run additional analysis.

We address all mentioned concerns:\n\n``What is the novelty of the method at a high level?\u2019\u2019\n\nWe are not aware that any other paper on OOD detection has written it in a Bayesian framework as we do modeling explicitly p(x|i) and p(x|o) and thus having an expression of p(y|x) in terms of p(y|x,i) and p(y|x,o). This then allows us to derive our CCU optimization framework as maximum likelihood estimation in this particular model. Most other approaches are more ad-hoc by enforcing e.g. low confidence on the out-distribution data. However, the main novelty compared to any other OOD method is that our approach allows to certify whole volumes to have low confidence and thus being able to certify that this volume will be identified by the classifier as ``out-distribution\u201d. This is done by using a density estimator for p(x|i) and p(x|o) which one can control (this is the reason for the ``simple\u2019\u2019 Gaussian mixture models for p(x|i) and p(x|o)) . Moreover, we bring up the challenging worst case evaluation of adversarial noise which we think should become standard in OOD detection. For the use in safety-critical systems the average case in terms of empirical evaluation on ``out-of-distribution\u2019\u2019 datasets is in our opinion not sufficient. Thus, we believe that our provable guarantees for the certification of low confidence over whole volumes and provably low confidence far away from the training data constitute important steps towards a ``general certification\u2019\u2019 of neural networks.\nWe have changed the introduction to highlight our contributions more clearly.\n\n\n``What is the performance of ACET when trained on adversarial uniform noise instead of adversarial tiny image dataset\u201d\n\nWe have added this comparison in Appendix F. In fact we did in the beginning train ACET using adversarial noise as in the original paper but we found out that the performance of ACET on OOD detection improves when training on adversarial tiny images. Moreover, we wanted to have all methods to be trained using the same information on the out-distribution so that one has a fair comparison. In short the results in Appendix F show that OOD detection of the ACET trained on\nadversarial tiny images is better for OOD detection but even for the worst case evaluation on adversarial noise. The reason is that the attack model is an l_2-ball with respect to a metric which is adapted to ``natural images\u2019\u2019 (we use the covariance of the training data) and not the l_infty attack\nwhich ACET does during training. As our ACET model is trained using tiny images it is more adapted to these natural images.\n\n\n``How do you ensure that the radius is not too large such that it has images that the model should actually be confident on (close to in distribution samples)?\u2019\u2019\n\nThanks for this question \u2013 we provide a detailed analysis in Appendix E. Indeed for all our 200 certified balls for each dataset we checked if they contain images from the training or test set and this does not happen on any of the datasets. Thus we think that our certification procedure works very reliably.\n\n\n``A flip-side is how sensitive the performance is to the score chosen for choosing the radius for computing the valid set of images for the adversary? It\u2019s possible that the 11% threshold is too high? What\u2019s the minimum confidence of CCU on the test images?\u2019\u2019\nWe also have analyzed this in Appendix E. For MNIST, FMNIST and SVHN no test images resp. a tiny fraction (less than 0.1%) gets less than 11% confidence. For Cifar100 1.3% of the test images get less than 1.1% confidence, and for Cifar10 5.3% less than 11%. \nHowever, one has to note that the certified bound of 11% confidence is an upper bound which is not tight in practical settings. Thus the actual maximal confidence over all the 200 certified balls of CCU which we found using PGD was never larger than the minimal confidence achieved on the test set (this is why CCU always has 100% AUC). However, in order to address the possibility that this could be an artifact of PGD not finding the global maximum on our certified balls, now we also report a lower bound on the AUC assuming that the maximal confidence of 11% (resp. 1.1%) would be attained by CCU in all the 200 certified balls. Note that even this theoretical lower bound still outperforms the other models\u2019 empirical AUC."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1460/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1460/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards neural networks that provably know when they don't know", "authors": ["Alexander Meinke", "Matthias Hein"], "authorids": ["alexander.meinke@uni-tuebingen.de", "matthias.hein@uni-tuebingen.de"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "It has recently been shown that ReLU networks produce arbitrarily over-confident predictions far away from the \ntraining data.

We have included EDL and DE in our evaluation (please see Table 1 and 2 in the main paper). As pointed out by the reviewer, both techniques outperform MC-Dropout. DE performs better than EDL regarding OOD detection but both methods are not competitive with outlier exposure and our CCU \u2013 this holds for all datasets but with particularly large differences on SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 . EDL and DE fail regarding the worst case evaluation on adversarial noise. For EDL the AUC is zero on all datasets, meaning that for all 200 certified balls for each dataset the maximal confidence achieved in the ball around uniform noise is higher than the confidence of all test samples.

The simplicity allows to obtain guarantees on the probability of an input being considered out of class. The model output p(y | x) critically uses the probability of being out of distribution. Hence guarantees on being detected as out of distribution translate to guarantees on p(y|x) being close to uniform.\n\nDecision: I vote for accepting the paper. The paper has some clear strengths. However, I have some concerns regarding experiments and comparison to previous work. It would be great if the authors could clarify. \n\nStrengths: The paper\u2019s methodolgy is clearly written.  The modeling is clear and sound. Overall, this idea is a promising approach to obtain networks that are provably under-confident far from training examples. The training cost for this approach is comparable to standard training, and the approach seems scalable and broadly applicable in general. \n\nThe experimental evaluation is also clearly described. Worst-case evaluation of OOD (out of domain) performance seems novel and the gains not this objective using the proposed approach of this paper are interesting and promising. \n\nConcerns: While the paper explains the proposed method well, the description of previous work and relation to previous work is inadequate. After spending some hours reading the cited paper, I am still confused about what\u2019s the novelty of this work at a high level. \nThis work uses p(x|i) and p(x|o) in the computation of p(y|x) during inference, where i and o are in distribution and out of distribution respectively. This is crucial to obtain guarantees one performance. However, how does this compare to other previous work that also uses some kind of generative modeling to model in/out distribution? A bunch of papers are cited in the introduction as doing this, but the relationship to the proposed work is unclear.\n\n\u2014 I have a major experimental concern: When comparing against ACET, the baseline of performing adversarial style training on random noise inputs seems more appropriate since it\u2019s closer to the evaluation metric (which picks random noise as out of domain and not 80M Tiny Images). What does the performance of this ACET baseline look like?\n\n\u2014 During evaluation, how do you ensure that the radius is not too large such that it has images that the model should actually be confident on (close to in distribution samples). A flip-side is how sensitive the performance is to the score chosen for choosing the radius for computing the valid set of images for the adversary? It\u2019s possible that the 11%  threshold is too high? What\u2019s the minimum confidence of CCU on the test images?\n\nMinor comments on writing: \n\u2014K_i, K_0 are not defined when writing the expression for GMM\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1460/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1460/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Towards neural networks that provably know when they don't know", "authors": ["Alexander Meinke", "Matthias Hein"], "authorids": ["alexander.meinke@uni-tuebingen.de", "matthias.hein@uni-tuebingen.de"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "It has recently been shown that ReLU networks produce arbitrarily over-confident predictions far away from the \ntraining data.
