For classification, the fine-tuning objective encourages out-of-distribution samples to have a uniform distribution over all class labels. For density estimation, the objective encourages out-of-distribution samples to be ranked as less probability than in-distribution samples. On a variety of image and text datasets, this additional fine-tuning step results in a network that does much better at outlier detection than a naive baseline, sometimes approaching perfect AUROC.\n\nThe biggest weakness in this paper is the assumption that we have access to out-of-distribution data, and that we will encounter data from that same distribution in the future. For the typical anomaly detection setting, we expect that anomalies could look like almost anything. For example, in network intrusion detection (a common application of anomaly detection), future attacks are likely to have different characteristics than past attacks, but will still look unusual in some way. The challenge is to define \"normal\" behavior in a way that captures the full range of normal while excluding \"unusual\" examples. This topic has been studied for decades.\n\nThus, I would not classify this paper as an anomaly detection paper. Instead, it's defining a new task and evaluating performance on that task. The empirical results demonstrate that the optimization succeeds in optimizing the objective it was given. What's missing is the justification for this problem setting -- when is it the case that we need to detect outliers *and* have access to the distribution over outliers?\n\n--------\n\nUPDATE AFTER RESPONSE PERIOD:\n\nMy initial read of this paper was incorrect -- the authors do indeed separate the outlier distribution used to train the detector from the outlier distribution used for evaluation. Much of these details are in Appendix A; I suggest that the authors move some of this earlier or more heavily reference Appendix A when describing the methods and introducing the results. I am not well-read in the other work in this area, but this looks like a nice advance.\n\nBased on my read of the related work section (again, having not studied the other papers), it looks like this work fills a slightly different niche from some previous work. In particular, OE is unlikely to be adversarially robust. So this might be a poor choice for finding anomalies that represent malicious behavior (e.g., network intrusion detection, adversarial examples, etc.), but good for finding natural examples from a different distribution (e.g., data entry errors).\n\nMy main remaining reservation is that this work is still at the stage of empirical observation -- I hope that future work (by these authors or others) can investigate the assumptions necessary for this method to work, and even characterize how well we should expect it to work. Without a framework for understanding generalization in this context, we may see a proliferation of heuristics that succeed on benchmarks without developing the underlying principles.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1125/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Anomaly Detection with Outlier Exposure", "abstract": "It is important to detect anomalous inputs when deploying machine learning systems.

Due to space limitations, in Appendix A we list the results for each D_out^test distribution, and we give the full descriptions of the D_out^test distributions. The test D_out^test distributions consist in Gaussian Noise, Rademacher Noise, Bernoulli Noise, Blobs, Icons-50 (emojis), Textures, Places365, LSUN, ImageNet (the 800 ImageNet-1K classes not in Tiny ImageNet and not in D_out^OE), CIFAR-10/100, and Chars74K anomalies. For NLP we use SNLI, IMDB, Multi30K, WMT16, Yelp, and various subsets of the English Web Treebank. We therefore test our models with approximately double the number of D_out^test image distributions compared to prior work; we also test in NLP, unlike nearly all other recent work in OOD detection.\n\nYour read is correct that 80 Million Tiny Images are used for SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100; these images are too low-resolution (32x32x3) for Tiny ImageNet, so for that we use ImageNet-22K (minus ImageNet-1K). For NLP, we use WikiText-2, but in the discussion we note using the Project Gutenberg corpus also works, so the dataset choice has flexibility even in NLP. Thanks to your comment, we will add a link to Appendix A in the caption of Table 1 for the full results and make the interactions between D_in, D_out^OE, D_out^test clearer.\n\nAs for accuracy, the fixed coefficient of lambda = 0.5 for the vision experiments leads to slight degradation when tuning with OE, like other approaches. For example, a vanilla CIFAR-10 Wide ResNet has 5.16% classification error, while with OE tuning it has 5.27% error. This degradation can be further reduced by training from scratch (Appendix E). We will look into ``negative transfer.''

Yes, it makes a big difference that the \"training\" outliers are from different datasets than the \"test\" outliers -- I'm happy I was mistaken in my previous understanding.\n\nI'll study the paper some more, but after quickly rereading some key sections, I don't understand exactly what combinations of D_in, D_out^OE, and D_out^test were used, e.g., in Table 1. From the row labels, I can figure out what D_in is. From Section 4.2.2., it sounds like you used 80 Million Tiny Images as D_out^OE for SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR-100. Was ImageNet-22K used as D_out^OE for Tiny ImageNet? The text is ambiguous. And then, what was used for D_out^test?\n\nIn general, the effectiveness of these techniques will rely heavily on the nature of the datasets used. With some combinations, we should expect OE to reduce the accuracy of anomaly detection, much like the \"negative transfer\" phenomenon in transfer learning.

In the setup you describe, out-of-distribution data is available during training, and data from that same distribution is encountered at test time. We agree that such a setup has issues, and we intentionally avoided that setup. We do not assume access to the test distribution, but this confusion is understandable as many recent OOD papers assume this. In particular, we took great care to keep datasets disjoint in our experiments, and the only out-of-distribution dataset examples we use at training time come from the realistic, diverse Outlier Exposure datasets described in Section 4.2.2. We ensured that these OE datasets were disjoint with the out-of-distribution data evaluated at test time. For instance, in the NLP experiments, we used WikiText-2 as the OE dataset, and none of the NLP OOD datasets evaluated on at test time were collected from Wikipedia.\n\nOne of our contributions is that training on the OE datasets which we identified leads to generalization to novel forms of anomalies. Concretely, with SVHN as the in-distribution, we found that OE improved OOD detection on the Icons-50 dataset of emojis, even though the OE dataset consisted in natural images and did not contain any emojis.

[2] propose training against GAN-generated out-of-distribution data, and they use a confidence loss for anomaly detection with multiclass classification as the original task. By contrast, we consider a broader range of original tasks, including density estimation and natural language settings, and we show how to incorporate Outlier Exposure for each scenario.\n\nAnother crucial difference between our work and [2] is that we demonstrate that realistic, diverse data is significantly more effective than GAN-generated examples, and is scalable to complex, high-resolution data that everyday GANs have difficulty generating. Likewise, GANs are currently not capable of generating high-quality text. Finally, Lee et al. [2] state in Appendix B, \u201cFor each out-of-distribution dataset, we randomly select 1,000 images for tuning the penalty parameter \u03b2, mini-batch size and learning rate.\u201d Thus some of their hyperparameters are tuned on OOD test data, which is not the case in our work. Hence, our work is in a different setting from Lee et al. [2]. In our paper we show how to use real data to _consistently_ improve detection in a host of settings. In essence, our some of our multiclass experiments are built on the seminal work of Lee et al. [2] by using real and diverse data. \n\nOur primary contribution is that real data from a diverse source can be used to train anomaly detectors which generalize to anomalies from new and different distributions, so there is no need to use GANs or assume access to the test distributions. We demonstrate this in a variety of settings, showing that this technique is general and consistently boosts performance.\n\nSecondary sources of novelty in our paper include the margin loss for OOD detection with density estimators, the cross entropy OOD score instead of MSP (Appendix G), posterior rescaling for confidence calibration in the presence of OOD data (Appendix C), and our observation that a cutting-edge CIFAR-10 density model unexpectedly assigns higher density to SVHN images than to CIFAR-10 images. The latter contribution forms the basis for a concurrent submission by different authors, which can be found here: https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xwNhCcYm Since that work is concurrent, it does not detract from our paper\u2019s novelty. We should note that we not only reveal that density estimates are unreasonable on out-of-distribution points, but we also ameliorate it with Outlier Exposure.\n\n2.\nWe have added a section comparing to ODIN [3] (Appendix I). We will incorporate the results into the main paper if you think we should.\n\n3.\nThank you for pointing out these related works. The works of [4] and [5] are ECCV 2018 and NIPS 2018 papers, both of which are for conferences occurring after the submission deadline of this paper. We have a working implementation of [4] and will incorporate it into the paper it once we are sure that it is a faithful reproduction. We think that our comparisons on multiclass OOD detection (including the baseline [1], Lee et al. [2], DeVries et al., Liang et al. [3]), density estimation OOD detection, and confidence calibration on vision and NLP datasets are sufficient to demonstrate our method.\n\nEdit: Thank you very much for taking the time to read this response and update your score."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1125/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1125/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1125/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Anomaly Detection with Outlier Exposure", "abstract": "It is important to detect anomalous inputs when deploying machine learning systems.

", "review": "I have read authors' reply.  In response to authors' comprehensive reply and feedback. I upgrade my score to 6. As authors mentioned, the extension to density estimators is an original novelty of this paper, but I still have some concern that OE loss for classification is basically the same as [2]. I think it is better to clarify this in the draft. \n\nSummary===\n\nThis paper proposes a new fine-tuning method for improving the performance of existing anomaly detectors. The main idea is additionally optimizing the \u201cOutlier Exposure (OE)\u201d loss on outlier dataset. Specifically, for softmax classifier, the authors set the OE loss to the KL divergence loss between posterior distribution and uniform distribution. For density estimator, they set the OE loss to a margin ranking loss. The proposed method improves the detection performance of baseline methods on various vision and NLP datasets. While the research topic of this paper is interesting, I recommend rejections because I have concerns about novelty and the experimental results.\n\nDetailed comments ===\n\n1. OE loss for softmax classifier\n\nFor softmax classifier, the OE loss forces the posterior distribution to become uniform distribution on outlier dataset. I think this loss function is very similar to a confidence loss (equation 2) proposed in [2]: Lee et al., 2017 [2] also proposed the loss function minimizing the KL divergence between posterior distribution and uniform distribution on out-of-distribution, and evaluated the effects of it on \"unseen\" out-of-distribution (see Table 1 of [2]). Could the authors clarify the difference with the confidence loss in [2], and compare the performance with it? Without that, I feel that the novelty of this paper is not significant.\n\n2. More comparison with baselines\n\nThe authors said that they didn\u2019t compare the performance with simple inference methods like ODIN [3] since ODIN tunes the hyper-parameters using data from (tested) out-of-distribution. However, I think that the authors can compare the performance with ODIN by tuning the hyper-parameters of it on outlier dataset which is used for training OE loss. Could the authors provide more experimental results by comparing the performance with ODIN? \n\n3. Related work\n\nI would appreciate if the authors can survey and compare more baselines such as [4] and [5]. \n\n[1] Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel.
