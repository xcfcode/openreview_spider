We would also like to respond to the raised concerns:\n\nRegarding 'transferability' of the adversary: we believe that detectors need a different kind of transferability than adversaries. Adversaries need to generalize across models since an adversary will typically not know the exact model it is trying to fool. Detectors, on the other hand, would be trained by the same entity that would also train the model and thus the specific model would be known. Thus, a detector need not necessarily be model-agnostic (it would nevertheless be interesting to see if training such a detector would be possible). A detector does *not* know, however, what kind of adversary it will face. Thus, it is important that a detector works equally well for many adversaries. Because of this setting, we consider transferability in the case of detectors to be a transferability across adversaries (and not models). Accordingly, this is also what we investigated in the experiments.\n\nRegarding the detectability of dynamic adversaries: we acknowledge that there is room for future improvement and 70% detectability in the worst case is not satisfying. However, we would also like to emphasize (see also our other comment) that this worst case is actually relatively unlikely since it requires that the adversary has access to the detector's predictions and gradients. This is a stronger assumption than granting the adversary access to the original classifier's predictions and gradients since the classifier's predictions often need to be presented to a user (and, thus, also to an adversary). The same is typically not true for the predictions of the adversary detector as they will only be used internally.\n\nRegarding the minor comments: we have addressed those in the revised version of the paper. \n\nRegarding \"has the image actually been tested to see if it is adversarial\": yes, this is exactly the \"predictive accuracy on adversarial images\" in Figure 2 and Figure 6. As this accuracy is larger than 0, there are some images where the adversaries fail to fool the classifier. Nevertheless, we included those images when computing the detectability as the images contain adversarial perturbations (albeit not sufficient to fool the classifier). Detectability restricted to adversarial examples which actually fool the classifier would probably be larger than the detectability reported in the Figure 2 and Figure 6."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations", "abstract": "Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years.

Here is a more detailed changelog:\n\n* Fixed a bug in the ImageNet experiment: we originally applied the softmax operator twice (once before and once after selecting the ten target classes). This did not affect the accuracy of the classification network but made the network harder to fool by adversaries for similar reasons as in the ``defensive distillation'' approach. We have corrected the issue in the updated version of the paper by applying softmax only after selection the ten target classes. To briefly summarize the corrected results: adversaries remain detectable with an accuracy of at least 85% (with the same exception as before, the basic iterative l2-based adversary for epsilon=400). More details are contained in the updated Section 4.2. Sorry for this error in the first revision.\n* Fixed wrong resolution in Figure 1 (16x16 instead of 8x8). Thanks to AnonReviewer3 for noting this.\n* Input range specified to be [0, 255] (Section 4.1.1). Thanks to AnonReviewer1 for requesting clarification on this.\n* Clarified computation of adversarial detectability (footnote in Section 4.1.1).\n* We discuss briefly that dynamic adversaries are based on stronger assumptions than static adversaries (footnote in Section 3.3)\n* Clarified that we did use version 1 of DeepFool (Section 3.1)\n* Fixed x-axis label in Figure 2 (right). Thanks to AnonReviewer2 for noting this.\n* Moved legend in Figure 2 (left) to upper right corner based on suggestion of AnonReviewer2.\n* Clarified choices of \\sigma in Figure 5\n* Adding more details about the dynamic adversary training method. \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations", "abstract": "Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years.

Importantly, the authors investigate whether it is possible to build an adversarial detector which is resilient to adversarial examples built against *both* the classifier and the detector. Their results suggest that training a detector in this more difficult setting still yields gains but does not entirely resolve the problem of detecting adversarial examples.\n\nMajor comments:\n\nThe authors describe a novel approach for dealing with adversarial examples from a security standpoint -- namely, build an independent system to detect the adversary so a human might intervene in those cases. \n\nA potential confound of this approach is that an adversary might respond by constructing adversarial examples to fool *both* the original classifier and the new detector. If that were possible, then this approach is moot since an attacker could always outwit the original system. To their credit, the authors show that building a 'dynamic' detector to detect adversarial examples but also be resilient to an adversary mitigates this potential escalation (worse case from 55% to 70% detection rate). Even though the 'dynamic' detector  demonstrates positive gains, I am concerned about overall scores. Detecting adversarial examples at this rate would not be a reliable security procedure.\n\nMy second comment is about 'model transferability'. My definition of 'model transferability' is different then the one used in the paper. My definition means that one constructs an adversarial example on one network and measures how well the adversarial examples attack a second trained model -- where the second model has been trained with different initial conditions. (The author's definition of 'transferability' is based on seeing how well the detector generalizes across training methods). 'Model transferability' (per my definition) is quite important because it measures how general an adversarial example is across all models -- and not specific to a given trained model. Different methods have different levels of 'model transferability' (Kurakin et al, 2016) and I am concerned how well the detector they built would be able to detect adversarial examples across *all models* and not just the trained model in question. In other words, a good detector would be able to detect adversarial examples from any network and not just one particularly trained network. This question seems largely unaddressed in this paper but perhaps I missed some subtle point in their descriptions.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nIf there were any points in the bottom-left of the Figure 2 left, then this would be very important to see -- perhaps move the legend to highlight if the area contains no points.\n\n- X-axis label is wrong in Figure 2 right.\n\nMeasure the transferability of the detector?\n\n- How is \\sigma labeled on Figure 5?\n\n- Whenever an image is constructed to be an 'adversary', has the image actually been tested to see if it is adversarial? In other words, does the adversarial image actually result in a misclassification by the original network?", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations", "abstract": "Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years.

See Section 4.1.2 for an evaluation of the robustness against a dynamic adversary and Section 5 for a discussion.\n\nWe would also like to emphasize that while constructing a dynamic adversary against an adversary detector is possible, it requires access to the detector's predictions and gradients. This is a stronger assumption than granting the adversary access to the original classifier's predictions and gradients since the classifier's predictions need often be presented to a user (and thus also to an adversary). The same is typically not true for the predictions of the adversary detector as they will only be used internally.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations", "abstract": "Machine learning and  deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on perceptual tasks in recent years.
