An extension to continuous cases is given.\n\nWhile the paper has some interesting idea and the problem of dealing with extrapolation in RL is important, the approach appears somewhat ad hoc and the contributions limited.\n\nFor example, the constraint is based on whether (s,a) is in B, but this condition can be quite delicate in a stochastic problem (seeing a in s *once* may still allow large extrapolation error if that only observed transition is not representative).  Section 4.1 gives some nice insights for the special finite MDP case, but those results are a little weak (requiring strong assumption that may not hold in practice) --- an example being the requirement that s' be included in data if (s,a) is in data and P(s'|s,a)>0 [beginning of section 4.1].\n\nIn contrast, there are other more robust and principled ways, such as counterfactual risk minimization (CRM) for contextual bandits (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/swaminathan15a.html).  For MDPs, the Bayesian version of DQN (the cited Azizzadenesheli et al., as well as Lipton et al. at AAAI'18) can be used to constrain the learned policy as well, with a simple modification of using the CRM idea for bandits.

When the paper is de-anonymized we will include a GitHub repository in the paper. Until then, we have included the core algorithm code in an anonymous pastebin ( https://pastebin.com/UTaiR5ZZ ), which should speed up your implementation.\n\n> In the algorithm description (Algorithm 1 in the paper), could you explain how the perturbation model is updated in more detail. Equation 10 is equally confusing. I'm trying to understand whether the actions should come from a sampled mini-batch or if they should come from the VAE decoder when (1) passing them to the perturbation model to compute perturbations and (2) when actually perturbing the actions before passing them to the critic network.\n\nThe actions can come from anywhere. Either the mini-batch, randomly generated, or from the VAE. During the target update and during test time, the perturbations are applied to actions generated by the VAE, so it makes the most sense to train them on the same distribution. \n\nEquation 10 describes the deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DPG). The perturbation model is updated so that the perturbed actions maximize the critic. Normally with DPG, there is a policy pi(s) which is trained to maximize Q(s,pi(s)). In our method, instead of pi(s) which can output any action, we have xi(s,a) + a, where xi(s,a) can only output in a limited range. \n\n> Could you also give me some more intuition on why a perturbation model is trained? It seems as though we could just leave the perturbation model out and just do Q-learning using the VAE, critic, and value networks. \n\nYou could, but as discussed in the paper, using a perturbation model gives an increase in flexibility in the action selection. For example, if the VAE outputs 10 similar actions, allowing perturbations gives more diversity in actions that could be possibly selected. Another case is where the entire action space has been adequately covered, and any action could be viably generated by the VAE. To see the highest valued action would likely require sampling from the VAE many times. Allowing perturbations avoids this issue. \n\n> Finally, equation (11) implies that the value function is trained on a mini-batch of next states instead of current states.

A concern presented by the reviewer was limited technical contribution. We would like to re-emphasize our contribution towards the introduction and analysis of extrapolation error in off-policy learning. Our paper provides important insight into the working of deep reinforcement learning with finite amounts of data, or the purely \u201cexploitative\u201d setting, as well as imitation learning with noisy demonstrations. \n  \n> It makes intuitive sense that the proposed approach works well as long as we only encounter state-action pairs that are closed to one of the state-action pairs in the batch.  However, I do not expect that this is always the case.  The proposed method is to simply choose the closest action in the batch.  Then why does the proposed approach perform well?\n \nIn regions with no data at all, there is no possible mechanism for recovery because the agent, and any possible agent, will not have trained in this region. Taking the action of the closest state-action pair is an oversimplification of our method, which likely stems from the lack of clarity in our original version of Section 4.2, which has been re-written. Our BCQ algorithm produces deep network policies that can be evaluated across the entire state space and considers both the similarity of the action to the batch as well as the expected value of the action. \n\nThat being said, it is important to take actions which are \u201cclose\u201d in the Bellman update to minimize the extrapolation error in the value estimate. Otherwise, as shown in Section 3.2, there can be deterioration in performance even in regions of certainty. That is, a non-batch-constrained off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm may fail if exposed to any uncertain regions during training. Our algorithm performs well by reducing the error into the system. Informally, our value estimates are more accurate. \n \nIn experiments where BCQ may take actions leading it to unseen states, such as in the experiments with an expert behavioral policy without exploration, we find that there is sufficient generalization to regions with less data to still perform well, while stabilizing the value function. \n\nFor future work, an interesting extension of the algorithm would be to bias it towards regions of certainty, through an optimism-under-certainty heuristic, the polar-opposite to many exploration algorithms. This occurs implicitly in our algorithm as mimicking previously taken actions is more likely to lead to regions of certainty, but could be enforced more strongly. \n \n> A key assumption in the discrete case is that whole episodes are in the batch.  This is rather restricting, because in many applications, it is infeasible to collect a whole episode, and parts of many episodes are collected from many agents.\n \nThe data doesn't need to be collected in episodic fashion, rather, that there is sufficient coverage. Collecting data in episodes is one way to ensure this, but not specifically required. This is a weaker assumption than assumptions necessary for standard Q-learning, as we no longer require visitation over all possible state-action pairs.

We have added an experimental result to the supplementary material to distinguish ourselves further from imitation learning algorithms and made several clarifying statements and adjustments based on your recommendations.\n \nOne con listed was missing comparisons against other state of the art imitation learning algorithms which are robust to noisy demonstrations. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any which satisfy the batch setting, where no further data is collected, while also setting no requirements on data being labelled expert vs. non-expert. One algorithm which does satisfy these conditions is [1], but only operates in with discrete actions, making it weak baseline in a continuous control benchmark, where independent discretization would be required. If there was a particular algorithm you had in mind when writing the review, we would be happy to include it in the final paper.\n \nWe also note the line between off-policy and robust imitation is fairly thin. For example, in the tabular setting, our approach can learn from the set of data that includes all state-action pairs, similarly to off-policy learning. All state-action pairs, of course, also includes expert actions and could be considered a robust imitation learning algorithm as well. An expert behavioral policy is necessary for the data collection process to be sufficiently interesting, as a purely randomly policy doesn\u2019t cover enough of the state space for it to be possible to learn meaningful behavior. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm as an off-policy algorithm, we included results with a purely random behavioral policy on a pendulum and reacher task in the supplementary material B, where the state space can be sufficiently covered by taking random actions. \n \nFurther Responses to Questions/Comments: \n\n> Could one obtain a similar effect to BCRL by simply initializing the value estimates pessimistically?\n \nEssentially yes, especially in the tabular setting, however, this would slow learning as it may take many updates to \u201cwash away\u201d initial negative bias. Furthermore, in a function approximation setting, maintaining an optimistic or pessimistic initialization over many timesteps is impractical and often implausible. Finally, for a fixed, non-batch-constrained policy, this also gives biased estimates. Introducing the notion of batch-constrained gives some understanding to when the policy would be biased vs. when it wouldn't.\n \n> Sec 4.1: Since B is a set of (s, a, s', r) tuples, what does it mean for a state s' to be \"in B\"?

BCRL attempts to avoid backing up values from states that are not present in the training data, on the assumption that the current estimates of these values are likely to be inaccurate. In the continuous state-action case, this is accomplished by training a generative model to propose, given a state `s`, an action `a` such that a transition similar to `(s, a)` is in the training data. A secondary policy is then trained to perturb the proposed action within a constrained region to maximize value. BCRL outperforms DDPG and DQN when learning from fixed data, but BCRL is slightly worse than behavior cloning at learning to reproduce an expert policy that does not take exploration actions.\n\nReview:\nThe overall approach is sound. The problem of extrapolation is intuitively obvious, but not something I had thought about before. I think typically exploration would correct the problem since states with over-estimated values would become more likely to be reached, giving an opportunity to get a better estimate. \n\nThe learning setting is closer to imitation learning than to what I would call RL, since the BCRL approach essentially avoids extrapolation error by ignoring the parts of the problem that are not represented in the training data. The well-known problem with behavior cloning is compounding errors once the agent strays into areas of the state space that are far from the training data. To me \"off-policy RL\" implies that the goal is to learn a complete policy from off-policy data. I think the \"competitors\" to which BCRL should be compared are imitation learning algorithms address noisy demonstrations, and not so much off-policy RL algorithms. It would also be interesting to see the generalization performance of BCRL outside of its training data.\n\nThe BCRL idea might be applicable in a conventional RL setting as well, since the initial stages of learning could be subject to a similar extrapolation error until there has been enough exploration. A comparison to something like TRPO in this setting would be interesting.\n\nThe paper is well-written with good coverage of related literature. There are a few points where the technical content is imprecise, which I note below. \n\nComments / Questions:\n* Could one obtain a similar effect to BCRL by simply initializing the value estimates pessimistically?\n* Sec 4.1: Since B is a set of (s, a, s', r) tuples, what does it mean for a state s' to be \"in B\"?

Since the actions in these control problems are vectors, what does a scalar constraint correspond to? How is the constraint enforced during learning?\n* What are the distance functions D_S and D_A?\n\nPros:\n* A good approach to applying RL methods in the \"imitation-like\" setting. I've seen similar things attempted before, but this method makes more sense. \n\nCons:\n* The learning setting is more like \"fuzzy\" behavior cloning from noisy data than off-policy RL.

However, I do not expect that this is always the case.  The proposed method is to simply choose the closest action in the batch.  Then why does the proposed approach perform well?  Is it because the experiments are performed under rather deterministic settings?  How often are no state-action pairs found in the neighbor?

This is rather restricting, because in many applications, it is infeasible to collect a whole episode, and parts of many episodes are collected from many agents.  Although this assumption is stated, it would be nice to emphasize by also stating that the theorems do not hold when this assumption does not hold.  The assumption becomes less important for continuous case, because of approximation.

From what is stated at a theoretical level, Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 are not broken by non-determinism.\n \nThe Bellman operator assumes access to the underlying MDP as it includes an expectation over the next state. The batch Bellman operator, which we introduce, is an extension which masks out any unseen state-action pairs by setting their value to infinity. As a result, the batch Bellman operator can still access the true expectation, even with only a sample of the possible transitions in the batch, allowing Theorem 1 and Lemma 1 to hold.\n \nThat being said, I believe the point you are making has to do with the more practical scenario, say with a batch-constrained tabular Q-learning-- what happens if we only have a sample of the possible transitions, without access to the true expectation? Our approach makes the same practical assumption as other off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning and KBRL, which is that the samples you do have for (s,a) are representative of the true MDP. In this case, as you have stated, there is no guaranteed convergence to the true Q^pi(s,a), for any off-policy algorithm, unless the samples you have are indeed representative, e.g. the environment is deterministic or there is infinite data.

It clearly explains of a lot of issues with off-policy I've been realizing recently. \n\nI think there is an issue with Theorem 1 and the proof of Lemma 1 - in my mind, it is fixed by some assumption about the environment.  The issue I see is that the batch of data, for the state/action pairs we get to observe in the batch, may mis-represent the underlying MDP restricted to those states. \n\nFor instance, suppose there is a (s,a) pair where the action sometimes leads to 'success' and sometimes 'failure' - the terminal state. Like the state 's' could be the robot faces a pit, and the action 'a' could be a jump to get over it. Most of the time perhaps, the action leads to failure - the terminal state, but we were unlucky in our batch and we saw success. \n\nIf you assume they next state is deterministic based on the action - which may be reasonable for continuous robot control - where there are some precise values that always lead to success with the jump - I think you could get around this, but if not - like in Theorem 1 - I don't see how  Q^{\\pi}_{B}(s,a) = Q^{\\pi}(s,a), the first is the Q-value we learn from the batch, where we never see a failure after (s,a) so our Q will be high- but the latter is the true Q-value over the whole MDP - where we often see failure, and the Q would be low.\n\nLikewise in the proof of Lemma 1 - I think there is one natural new MDP M_{B} to define based on the data you observed, but you need to estimate the transitions from that data - and you might miss things. Like if you see\n\n(state, action, next_state):\n(s0, a0, s1)\n(s0, a0, s1)\n(s0, a0, s2)\n\nyou'd naturally set the transition P(s1 | s0, a0) = 2/3 and P(s2 | s0,  a0) = 1/3 -  but this might not be the true transitions.
