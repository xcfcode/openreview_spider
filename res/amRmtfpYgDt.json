The method works by dividing the state space into regions, where a different goal identifies each region. Then, using an episodic memory technique, the agent is able to learn about new experiences in a sample efficient way. This allows the agent to explore effectively, and learn a good policy quickly in problems where there are sparse rewards. The paper provides some theoretical justification for the new algorithm, and provides some empirical results that demonstrate its effectiveness. \n\n**Strengths:**\nThe paper combines two RL techniques in a novel way to address important issues in deep rl. The experiments demonstrate that RERL can achieve good performance on challenging problems. The paper also presents a good background overview of related work, which is useful to get appropriate context.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nThe use of the term episodic is a bit ambiguous, especially in the introduction. The word \u201cepisodic\u201d, as it refers to \u201cepisodic memory\u201d from neuroscience, needs to be clearly disambiguated the from the \u201cepisodic setting\u201d in RL, which is something completely different. Additional clarification in abstract/introduction would do a lot to reduce confusion.\n\nThe paper has many experiments on a variety of domains, but only a few of the results are included in the main text. I think including more of the results in the main paper would strengthen the conclusions and be more convincing for the reader. Also, some important experiment details are missing, like how many training steps was each agent trained for (what do \"iterations\" correspond to in Figure 5)? The number of independent runs (seeds) for each algorithm should also be listed. This information should be included so that the reader can better evaluate the variance of each method, and make more confident conclusions.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI vote to accept this paper. I think this paper presents a novel and interesting idea that is sufficiently supported by the empirical experiments. The challenges that the new methods attempts to address and important and central to good performance in deep RL, thus the papers results would be of interest to RL experimentalists and practitioners. However, I think the paper could be made stronger improving the clarity, and by including more of the experiments in the main text.\n\n**Questions:**\nHow many independent runs (seeds) were used in the experiments?\n\nIt was not clear to me whether the anti-goal $\\bar g$ is new in this paper, or if it is something that has been used before.\n\nMore about $\\bar g$: the paper states that it \u201cprevents the policy from getting stuck at the local optimum and enables the agent to learn to reach the goal location quickly,\u201d but does not offer an explanation why. Why does it keep the agent from getting stuck at a local optimum? And why does it help the agent reach the goal location quickly?\n\n**Minor Comments:**\n-I find the hyperlink highlighting in the text (the green and red boxes) to very distracting. I think removing them would improve the overall presentation of the paper.\n-The in text citation style could be improved. When citing an author and using their name in the text, they should be cited like \u201cFoo et al. (2020) propose a new method\u2026\u201d, and not like \u201c(Foo et al., 2020) propose a new method\u2026\u201d\n(For more details see: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html, for example.)\n-There is a missing figure reference on page 7.\n\n**After Author Response and Discussion:** Thanks to the authors for their responses. After reading the other reviews and the author responses, I am lowering my score to 5. I agree with the other reviewers about the experiments: they feel rushed, and the design and presentation is not as careful as it could be. I think the paper could be greatly improved by a little more attention the presentation of the experiments and their analysis in the main text.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2969/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2969/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regioned Episodic Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Jiarui_Jin1", "chenconglzh@sjtu.edu.cn", "~Ming_Zhou2", "~Weinan_Zhang1", "~Rasool_Fakoor1", "~David_Wipf1", "~Yong_Yu1", "~Jun_Wang2", "~Alex_Smola1"], "authors": ["Jiarui Jin", "Cong Chen", "Ming Zhou", "Weinan Zhang", "Rasool Fakoor", "David Wipf", "Yong Yu", "Jun Wang", "Alex Smola"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Episodic Memory", "Sample Efficiency"], "abstract": "Goal-oriented reinforcement learning algorithms are often good at exploration, not exploitation, while episodic algorithms excel at exploitation, not exploration.

This might raise some confusion for the reader.\n- The mapping \\phi is quite central to you method, but I failed to understand which type of mapping was used in your experiments. Consequently, which metric was adopted ?\n- \"we directly assign the visited state with the average value in the region as the anti-goal.\": Does this mean, the anti-goal is always in the same region as the visited state ? Can you please clarify this point/choice of anti-goal?\n- In eq.9, how does V^\\pi(x_s) depend on s_t (is it integrated to the inner minimization)?\n- \"slowly changing goal-conditioned tasks to guarantee stability by restricting goal updating within each region\": Do we need to guarantee slow (spatial) changing of the sampled region too for this stability to hold ? If yes, how is this enforced in the algorithm?\n- How were the existing approaches trained ? With which reward ? the one from eq.2 (i.e. using the region-based goal and anti-goal sampling ) ?\n- \"We further extend the task to evaluate whether the agent is able to reach any given position (\\epsilon-balls depicted in red) within the maze for Maze Ant\": What was the size of the agent (Ant) compared to the width of the corridor ? *Ant Maze look tight around agent, i.e if it learns to reach the end of the maze it can\u2019t miss any intermediate goal.*\n- From the goals and anti-goals visualizations, anti-goals seems to be always generated further ahead on the path to the target, while it was mentioned that the anti-goal is set to the average value in the region ? When getting closer to the target, won't these anti-goals between the reachable goals and the target keep the agent away from reaching it ? Can you please clarify this ?\n- Can you elaborate on the goal generation ablation study ? This seem to deserve more attention to better evaluate the algorithm.\n\n### Minor comments\n- Some notations are defined later in the paper than where they were first introduced.\n- In eq.9, should the argument be x_z ?\n- There is a problem with some figures and appendices references.\n- Did you try higher dimensional Point-Mass ?

We have responded to the concerns of the reviewers as individual comments below.\n\nAll reviewers agree that our idea is interesting and our contributions are valuable to the community. To summarize our contributions: (i) we demonstrate that RERL, a novel framework that combines the strengths of goal-oriented RL and episodic RL, perform well in many complex environments and  (ii) we propose to utilize hindsight and diversity constraints in goal generation, which allows agents to construct and update the regioned memories automatically.\n\nWe revised and updated the paper to address the reviewers' comments. In addition,  we conducted more experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our design within the scope of goal-oriented RL and presented the results in the Experiments section. We want to highlight that, the visualization study on generated goals shows that the exploration is actually promoted by our design. The agent is pulled by its goal and pushed by its anti-goal and goals from other regions, which is in line with our intuitive design motivation.\n\nHere is a list of new experiments:\n1.

We hope you will consider increasing your score after seeing our responses.\n\n>> The use of the term episodic is a bit ambiguous, especially in the introduction. The word \u201cepisodic\u201d, as it refers to \u201cepisodic memory\u201d from neuroscience, needs to be clearly disambiguated the from the \u201cepisodic setting\u201d in RL, which is something completely different. Additional clarification in abstract/introduction would do a lot to reduce confusion.\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We have clarified this in the revision. The \u201cepisodic\u201d in this paper refers to \u201cepisodic memory\u201d since RERL constructs and updates region-based memories to perform efficient updates. The \u201cepisodic setting\u201d in RL may mean the environment is under an episodic setting, which is different from ours.\n\n>> I suggest including more of the results in the main paper. Also, some important experiment details are missing, like how many training steps was each agent trained for (what do \"iterations\" correspond to in Figure 5)? \n\nGreat suggestion. We have increased the number of results in the main paper to 10. The \"iterations\" in Figure 5 correspond to total timesteps.\n\n>> How many independent runs (seeds) were used in the experiments?\n\n12 independent seeds were used in the experiments. \n\n>> It was not clear to me whether the anti-goal g\u00af is new in this paper, or if it is something that has been used before. Why does it keep the agent from getting stuck at a local optimum? And why does it help the agent reach the goal location quickly?\n\nThe anti-goal g\u00af is not new in this paper. It is first proposed in [1]. However, different from [1] where anti-goal g\u00af is generated by rollouts, we set the anti-goal as the state with the average value. The reason behind it is that it is hard to judge whether the agent performs well in each episode since the agent is learning and its performance is getting better. Therefore, we propose to use anti-goal as a baseline for it. Figure 2 in [1] illustrates that the anti-goal setting can avoid the agent from getting stuck in a local optimum.\n\n[1] Alexander Trott, et al.

Please also see the main comment above. We hope you will consider increasing your score after seeing our responses.\n\n>> \\mathcal{X} is sometimes used as a set, sometimes as a distribution. This might raise some confusion for the reader.\n\nThanks for pointing it out. In our method, \\mathcal{X}_{n} is a set and we have revised our paper to avoid such confusion.\n\n>> The mapping \\phi is quite central to your method, but I failed to understand which type of mapping was used in your experiments. Consequently, which metric was adopted?\n\n\\phi is a mapping function from state space to goal space which largely depends on an environment. For example, in the Ant Maze case, this mapping is to map the system state, which is a high-dimensional vector including information about the robot and the environment, to the 3-D position of the robot Ant. The mapping function \\phi is usually provided by an environment, such as gym robot environments.\n\n>> \"we directly assign the visited state with the average value in the region as the anti-goal.\": Does this mean, the anti-goal is always in the same region as the visited state? Can you please clarify this point/choice of anti-goal?\n\nYes. The reason behind it is that it is hard to judge whether the agent performs well enough in each episode and in each region, since the agent is learning and its performance is getting better. Therefore, we propose to use anti-goal as a baseline for it. \n\n>> In eq.9, how does V^\\pi(x_s) depend on s_t (is it integrated to the inner minimization)?\n\nYes. Since x_s = (s, g, g\u00af), we directly select x_s where s (i.e., s_t) can obtain the minimization.\n\n>> \"slowly changing goal-conditioned tasks to guarantee stability by restricting goal updating within each region\": Do we need to guarantee slow (spatial) changing of the sampled region too for this stability to hold? If yes, how is this enforced in the algorithm?\n\nYes. Our method adopts Boltzmann softmax to select appropriate regions. And the temperature of the softmax mechanism is changing.  At the beginning of training, the selection is nearly random to avoid richer-get-richer phenomena. In the middle stage of training, the Boltzmann softmax focuses on the region containing the state with the highest value. Then, only when the current region is overestimated will the agent switch to another region. Usually, it takes several rounds of updates to figure out whether the current region is overestimated.\n\n>> How were the existing approaches trained? With which reward? the one from eq.2 (i.e. using the region-based goal and anti-goal sampling)?\n\nYes. Existing goal-oriented RL approaches are trained using intrinsic rewards as shown in Eq2. \n\n>> \"We further extend the task to evaluate whether the agent is able to reach any given position (\\epsilon-balls depicted in red) within the maze for Maze Ant\": What was the size of the agent (Ant) compared to the width of the corridor? Ant Maze look tight around agent, i.e if it learns to reach the end of the maze it can\u2019t miss any intermediate goal.\n\nFig.4 (b) in our paper presents a typical example of the AntMaze environment. In practice, the size of the width of the corridor compared to the agent(Ant) is about 6, which guarantees that reaching any given position is a challenging task. The direct rendering result of the AntMaze environment we use is shown in Fig.8 in Appendix D.\n\n>> From the goals and anti-goals visualizations, anti-goals seems to be always generated further ahead on the path to the target, while it was mentioned that the anti-goal is set to the average value in the region ? When getting closer to the target, won't these anti-goals between the reachable goals and the target keep the agent away from reaching it ?\n\nYes. The labels of the original figure were reversed. In that figure, anti-goals were labeled as goals and goals as anti-goals. We have revised this in the updated version. In that figure, one can note that the agent is pulled by its goal and pushed by its anti-goal and goals from other regions, which is in line with our intuitive explanation.\n\n>> Can you elaborate on the goal generation ablation study ? This seem to deserve more attention to better evaluate the algorithm.\n\nYes, great suggestion. We have provided detailed descriptions of the setting in the ablation study (see Section 4. Impact of Goal Generation, and Impact of Hyper-parameter Selection). We have evaluated RERL with various RL algorithms in Figure 5(f), and various environments in Figure 5(a)(b)(c)(d)(i).\n\n>> Minor comments\n\nThank you for pointing out these problems. We have revised and re-written these parts in the paper. Please refer to the revised PDF. We have tried higher dimensional Point-Mass. The result is consistent with the 3-dimensional one.

I thought you'd show your approach working well in both, while the other methods struggle when used outside of their ideal setting.\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We have conducted experiments on the Atari game Pong. The episodic algorithms such as [1][2] work well in the environment. We report the result in figure 5(d). Typical goal-oriented environments provide explicit mapping function \\phi to map the state space to the goal space. However, Atari games do not provide such function and it will make goal-oriented RL hard to converge. To be specific, in the Pong environment, it\u2019s difficult to define goals since \\phi is not defined. Thus the performance of methods involving the goal-settings struggles to achieve good performance.\n\n>> seeing some assurance that the reason that it is working well is because the problem structure somehow matches the algorithm structure would be very valuable. Then, we can see it's not just luck but its DESIGN that is the cause of its experimental success. The way the results are currently presented, I'm left with the feeling that the algorithm is clever but perhaps limited in scope. More detailed experiments would help allay this fear.\n\nWe have conducted more experiments on both the environments suitable for goal-oriented RL algorithms (e.g., Maze Ant Locomotion) and the environment suitable for episodic RL algorithms (e.g., Atari Game). Results show that RERL obtains good performance in all goal-oriented environments and bad performance in Atari games. Such a performance gap is due to the difficulty in defining the distance in the state/goal space for Atari games. Experiments show that our design generates promising and explainable results for environments within the scope of Goal-Oriented RL. However, for environments where goal space is inexplicit, our algorithm cannot guarantee performance. We also provide the result of the visualization study in Figure 6, which implies that our goal generation approach can truly generate appropriate goals to encourage exploration.\n\n>> C2: Perhaps reword it? I wasn't able to interpret what is being said. I think there is a lot of important background being left unsaid.\n\nThanks for your suggestion and we have re-written C2. The idea behind C2 is that training goal-oriented RL models using all historical trajectories rather than selected ones would involve unrelated trajectories in training. The training process of goal generation algorithms thus could be unstable and inefficient, as data distribution shifts when the goal changes. It can be fairly efficient if updates happen only with highly related trajectories.\n\n>> \"a subset of state space\": As opposed to what? Doesn't the state space include ALL states? So, any set of states is a subset of the state space...?\n\nYes, it was meant to say that the goal space is a set of visited states. We have clarified it in the paper.\n\n>> \"an agent ... yields sparse rewards\"? Maybe I'm not understanding how you are using the phrase \"sparse rewards\"? I interpret it as an environment where most rewards are zero, so I don't see how they are \"computed\" or \"yielded\".\n\nYes, the sparse rewards are generated by the environment and used by an agent. \n\n>> In terms of related work, I was hoping to hear how you see your work relating to Konidaris' work on skill discovery.  \n\nWe include these references in the related work section and discuss the difference between this work and his work. The common idea we share is to break the original task into several sub-tasks. The main difference is that the sub-tasks are getting harder in the training procedure, while his method aims to find the option that can be used to accelerate the learning procedure.\n\n>> The paper needs a detailed editing pass.\n\nThank you for pointing out these problems.

Please also see the main comment above. We hope you will consider increasing your score after seeing our responses, updates, and new experiments.\n\n>>  situate their work in comparison with option-discovery approaches in RL\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We revised the related work section and included all suggested references in the related work section. In addition, we ran new experiments and compared our method with \u201cExploration in reinforcement learning with deep covering options\" (Jinnai et al. 2020) [called OPTION in Figure 5]. Please see Figure 5 in the experiment section.  \n\n>> To say that \"the application of reinforcement learning (RL) is still impractical in terms of sample efficiency\" is inaccurate. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that a sample inefficient RL algorithm can be still practical.  However, an RL method can be very cost-prohibitive for many real-world applications such as robotic, autonomous driving, etc. due to data collection cost (e.g. interaction with an environment). We updated the paper to clarify this. \n\n>> say some RL algorithms \"neglect the exploitation part\". \n\nYou are right. We have updated the paper to better describe this problem and the paragraph is re-written as \u201cThese methods intend to explore more unique trajectories and use all trajectories in the training procedure, which may involve unrelated ones and result in inefficient exploitation.\u201d \n\n>> The instability of RL is, to the best of my knowledge, not related to sparse rewards (C1).\n\nYou are right. We have updated the paper. Sparse reward issue mainly results in the long training time, while the instability of RL usually means failing in the training. \n\n>> I don't even understand C2 in introduction.\n\nWe have re-written C2, as follows: \u201cTraining goal-oriented RL models using all historical trajectories would involve unrelated trajectories in training. The training process of goal generation algorithms could be unstable and inefficient (Kumar et al.,2019), as data distribution shifts when the goal changes. It can be fairly efficient if updates happen only with highly related trajectories.\u201d\n\n>> with C3, I understand what you are trying to say, but maybe you can rephrase it? \n\nThanks for your kind suggestion and we have rephrased it.\n\n>> in general I find frequent typos and mistakes. \n\nThank you for pointing out these problems. We have revised and re-written these parts in the paper. Please refer to the revised PDF. \n\n>> why is the range for the reward signal open?\n\nThat was a typo and  R can be 1. Please refer to the revised and updated PDF. \n\n>> You consider domains with continuous actions, which means that the policy outputs a pdf over continuous space. It is then, not accurate to say that the policy output is bounded above by 1.\n\nIt is right that policy outputs a pdf over continuous space. We clip it by 1 if it is above by 1. Then, the policy output is bounded between 0 and 1. It is a standard practice of policy networks. Similar approaches can be found in SAC [1], TD3 [2].\n\n>> Does this obvious point require a citation?\n\nThat point is obvious and easy to understand. We have removed that citation.\n\n>> From Definition 1, can you clarify what is a \"perfect\" partition? We should be able to define it before attempting to find it.\n\nThe perfect partition of regions should satisfy the following properties:  (1) all the regions together cover the state space,  (2) there is no overlapping among all the regions,  (3) the goal generated from each region can not lead the agent to other regions. Actually, these three properties are the motivation of our diversity constraint design. Thanks a lot for this suggestion. We have updated the paper.\n\n>> In equation 5, how is max computed if the space is continuous?\n\nWe found that the original definition of \\mathcal{X}_{n} was confusing and have reformulated this equation. We compute the max for trajectories in a specific regioned memory. For instance, suppose that we have 5 trajectories in the upper region and 5 trajectories in the lower region in the AntMaze environment. The max here is computed for trajectories in each region separately. Such computation can be done if the space is continuous.\n\n\n>> In formulation 10, why did you choose this specific way of promoting diversity?\n\nThe motivation of the diversity constraint is to avoid the overlapping among all the regions. Note that trajectories in each region will be guided by a goal. Hence, we design to maximize the distances among the generated goals to automatically construct the regions without overlapping. We have edited the paper to make it more clear and the experiments show that this constraint can prevent the regions from overlapping.\n\n[1] Tuomas Haarnoja, et al.

In particular, the results presented in Figure 5 seem solid. But, based on the presentation up to this point, I was expecting to see a comparison on an environment that is good for goal-oriented methods and one that is good for episodic algorithms.

For an algorithm like this, its utility is measured in its ability to work according to its design.

With this in mind, I expect the authors to better situate their work in comparison with option-discovery approaches in RL such as \"Eigenoption discovery through the deep successor representation\" Machado et al., \"Option Discovery using Deep Skill Chaining\" Bagaria and Konidaris, and \"Exploration in reinforcement learning with deep covering options\" Jinnai et al., to name a few.\n\nSome additional comments and questions:\n\n- To say that \"the application of reinforcement learning (RL) is still impractical in terms of sample efficiency\" is inaccurate. Sample inefficiency is definitely an issue that can plague RL in some applications, but that does not mean that RL is impractical regardless of the application in question.\n\n- I don't understand what it means to say some RL algorithms \"neglect the exploitation part\". Surely, goal-oriented RL performs reward maximization in some sense, right?\n\n- The instability of RL is, to the best of my knowledge, not related to sparse rewards (C1). Among other things, it is related to convergence guarantees (or lack thereof) when using nonlinear approximators and highly-correlated updates. Can you provide citations that refute my claim and support yours?\n\n- I don't even understand C2 in introduction.\n\n- with C3, I understand what you are trying to say, but maybe you can rephrase it? Maybe say, breaking a task to a bunch of sub-tasks can avoid redundant exploration?\n\n- wrong citation for DDPG.\n\n- in general I find frequent typos and mistakes. For example, from related work, you say \"value propagation methods have proposed ...\" Humans propose to use value propagation methods that obtain trajectory-centric values estimates.\n\n- why is the range for the reward signal open? Why can't R be 1?\n\n- You consider domains with continuous actions, which means that the policy outputs a pdf over continuous space. It is then, not accurate to say that the policy output is bounded above by 1.\n\n- In equation (1), the notation for reward is off.\n\n-\"However, as stated in (Pritzel et al., 2017), in the environment with sparse rewards, there may be very few instances where the reward is non-zero, making it difficult for an agent to find good past experiences. \" Does this incredibly obvious point require a citation?!\n\n- From Definition 1, can you clarify what even is a \"perfect\" partition? We should be able to define it before attempting to find it.\n\n- In equation 5, how is max computed if the space is continuous?\n\n- In formulation 10, why did you choose this specific way of promoting diversity? It is not justified, and there is no theoretical evidence to demonstrate that this indeed gives us the diversity that you tout it would.\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2969/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2969/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Regioned Episodic Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Jiarui_Jin1", "chenconglzh@sjtu.edu.cn", "~Ming_Zhou2", "~Weinan_Zhang1", "~Rasool_Fakoor1", "~David_Wipf1", "~Yong_Yu1", "~Jun_Wang2", "~Alex_Smola1"], "authors": ["Jiarui Jin", "Cong Chen", "Ming Zhou", "Weinan Zhang", "Rasool Fakoor", "David Wipf", "Yong Yu", "Jun Wang", "Alex Smola"], "keywords": ["Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Episodic Memory", "Sample Efficiency"], "abstract": "Goal-oriented reinforcement learning algorithms are often good at exploration, not exploitation, while episodic algorithms excel at exploitation, not exploration. As a result, neither of these approaches alone can lead to a sample efficient algorithm in complex environments with high dimensional state space and delayed rewards. Motivated by these observations and shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce Regioned Episodic Reinforcement Learning (RERL) that combines the episodic and goal-oriented learning strengths and leads to a more sample efficient and ef- fective algorithm. RERL achieves this by decomposing the space into several sub-space regions and constructing regions that lead to more effective exploration and high values trajectories.
