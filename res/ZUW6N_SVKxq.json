That said, we agree that the original manuscript was not clear as to the sizes of matrices.  We have considerably clarified matrix sizes at many points within the manuscript (see AnonReviewer2 below), by adding additional discussion of matrix sizes under Eq. 4 and Eq. 16 to address your specific point.\n\nWe have considerably elaborated the exact form of Q(\\Omega, {G_\\ell}^L_{\\ell=2}, F_{L+1}|X) (e.g. including the new Eq. 25 giving the precise expression for the inducing terms.  In general, we have considerably elaborated this section, and we hope it is now much clearer.\n\nWe have added a substantial section on complexity (Sec. 5).  In the standard (non-DSVI) case, the complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(P_t^3)$, whereas in the inducing case, it is $\\mathcal{O}(P_i^3 + P_i^2 P_t)$.  Thus, by using a small number of inducing points, we are able to convert a cubic dependence on the number of input points into a linear dependence, which gives much improved scaling for DSVI. This is exactly the same scaling as a standard (non-deep) inducing GP.  But remarkably (detailed in that Section) it is better than standard DGPs, which additionally scale with the number of intermediate-layer features.\n\nMinor:\n * We have replaced \"task-dependent representation\" with \"they lack the capability to learn a top-layer representation, which is believed to be crucial for the effectiveness of deep methods\"\n * We have taken the reference to Fig. 2 out of the autoregressive section."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3242/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3242/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Kernel Processes", "authorids": ["~Laurence_Aitchison1", "~Adam_X._Yang1", "~Sebastian_W._Ober1"], "authors": ["Laurence Aitchison", "Adam X.

In fact, DKP computational complexity is equivalent to that of non-deep inducing GPs, which are much more widely used.  Indeed, non-deep inducing GPs have been used on some very large problems (e.g. [1,2]).  Further, recent work [3] has shown that by exploiting the equivalence between Bayesian neural networks and DGPs, we can scale even DGPs to e.g. ResNet like models for CIFAR-10, and we believe that similar approaches might be applicable to DKPs.\n\nThe computational complexity of both deep kernel learning and DKPs is equivalent to shallow inducing GPs, so we might expect somewhat similar performance for these methods. However, it is important to note that deep kernel learning and DKPs aren't necessarily directly comparable: deep kernel learning maximizes over the NN parameters, whereas in the DKP we perform full Bayesian inference over all parameters at all layers. At the same time, deep kernel learning offers more flexibility in the neural network architecture (e.g. convolutions, batchnorm) that we are hoping to develop in future work for DKPs.\n\nWe leave an in-depth investigation of the tradeoff between accuracy and number of inducing points to future work, in part because it will be highly dependent on the dataset and kernel.  Nonetheless:\n* In our experiments, we found good performance despite using a relatively small number of inducing points (100).\n* We expect the behaviour to be very similar to that of non-deep inducing GPs as in the limit of $\\delta_\\ell \\rightarrow \\infty$, our model is a shallow inducing GP, with a complex kernel, and the number of required inducing points for inducing GPs is well understood and behaved [4].\n\n[1] Hensman J, Fusi N, Lawrence ND.

We agree that there is alot in the paper, and we had considered breaking it up.  The issue is that:\n * If we just wrote a paper on the observation that deep Wishart process are equivalent to DGPs, we wouldn't be able to do any experiments, because the approximate posterior we'd like to use, the non-central Wishart, has an extremely  expensive probability density function (Appendix E).\n * If we just wrote a paper on deep inverse Wishart processes observation, its importance wouldn't be clear, as it would be difficult to link to DGPs/BNNs.\n\nWe are planning to write a fleshed-out follow up for JMLR, and we will extensively update the paper to improve clarity, including in response to the other reviewers.\n\nWe have included extensive appendices, and hope that in combination with the main paper, they give sufficient detail  on all points.  If there are any areas you'd like us to elaborate a further on, we'd be happy to do that.\n\nThe family of kernels is anything that can be written as a function of the Gram matrix.  This includes isotropic kernels (as you state), but also the dot-product kernel, the relu-kernel (Cho and Saul 2009), the cosine kernel and others.  This captures almost all kernels used in practice in the GP literature, but we agree that it isn't every kernel you could use in a DGP.\n\nThere are two key advantages of DKPs over DGPs:\n  1. Primarily, DKPs allow for _much_ better posterior approximations than DGPs.  A DGP has rotational symmetries in  the true posterior (Appendix D2) which are not captured by standard approximate posteriors.  In contrast, Gram matrices don't have these symmetries, offering the possibility of much better posterior approximations.  In fact, we even believe that in certain cases, the DKP posterior might even be *unimodal*.  These improvements are reflected in the empirical results for the ELBO, which can be written as the model-evidence minus the KL-divergence   from the approximate to the true posterior.\n  2. DKPs allow us to optimize $\\delta_\\ell$ (Eq 16b).  This is analogous to a width parameter in a Bayesian neural network: as the width goes to infinity the Gram matrix at the next layer becomes deterministic and  we end up with an NNGP.  For smaller widths, the prior over representations is more flexible/variable.  Likewise, $\\delta_\\ell$ in a deep inverse Wishart process goes to infinity, the Gram matrix at the next layer becomes deterministic (and exactly the same as in a NNGP).  Critically, in a BNN, we can't optimize the width (because it is  fixed by the network architecture), and we definitely can't send the width to infinity (as GPU memory is fixed).  In  contrast, we are able to optimize the deep inverse Wishart process degrees of freedom, which allows us to control the flexibility of the prior over representations, and we are able to use very large degrees of freedom, if that is beneficial for modelling the data."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3242/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3242/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Kernel Processes", "authorids": ["~Laurence_Aitchison1", "~Adam_X._Yang1", "~Sebastian_W._Ober1"], "authors": ["Laurence Aitchison", "Adam X.

The features in the intermediate layers are integrated out and the Gram matrix are Wishart distributed. A doubly stochastic variational inference method is proposed to learn DKPs. The idea looks novel to me. My major concern is about the writing.\n\n---\n##### Pros:\n\nThe paper is well-motivated and the idea is neat. For kernels that can be written as functions of the Gram matrix, DKP seems to be a better formulation than DGP. Due to difficulty in posterior inference, the authors propose to use inverse Wishart prior over Gram matrices. The use of inverse Wishart prior is explained and discussed in Appendix, which is satisfying. The authors also explain how the sparse variational inference method for DKP sidesteps the difficulties of capturing permutation and rotational symmetries in standard variational inference of BNNs or DGPs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\n---\n##### Cons: \n\nThe paper is hard to read and understand. There are a lot of undefined or inconsistent notations, for example:\n(1) In the beginning of the Background section, the data dimension is sometimes denoted as uppercase $P$, sometimes denoted as lowercase $p$.\n\n(2) Following Eqn. (2), the inverse $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}$ is not defined. What is $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$? It seems that by $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^{-1}$ the authors mean the inverse of $\\mathbf{S}$, but that is a weird notation.\n\n(3) In section 3, the notations $\\mathbf{F}_\\ell$ and $N_\\ell$ are not explained. Although it can be inferred from the equations (4a-4c) or from the DGP literature, it is still obscure. $\\mathbf{K}$ is sometimes used as a function that operates on the Gram matrix and sometimes used as the Kernel matrix, which need.\n\n(4) In Eqn. (8), $\\bm{G}_{\\ell}-1$ should be $\\bm{G}_{\\ell-1}$.\n\nFollowing that, the author mentioned \u201cso $\\mathbf{G}_{\\ell+1}$ can be written as \u2026\u201d but used subscripts $\\ell$ and $\\ell-1$ in Eqn. (9).\n\n(5) In Eqn. (11), it is not clear what $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{features}}$ means.\n\nI just mentioned a few and there are many more.

The paper begins by considering a DGP with isotropic kernels across the layers and realizes that the Gram matrices are Wishart distributed. Based on this, the paper proposes to bypass the inference of the features and sample the Gram matrices directly from Wishart distributions. This insight, in addition to the layered structure of DGPs, gives rise to the proposed prior distribution. Furthermore, given the restrictions of the Wishart distribution for modelling covariance matrices of arbitrary size [1], as well as the conjugacy properties of the inverse Wishart distribution, the paper uses the inverse Wishart distribution instead. Doubly stochastic variational inference is proposed for approximating the posterior distribution which includes the use of inducing points thanks to the marginalization properties of the inverse Wishart distribution. The experimental contribution consists of a comparison against DGP and Neural Network GP on the UCI, MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nIn terms of clarity, the readability of the paper is negatively affected by being too broad with the results presented. It seems that the equivalence between GPs with Wishart processes as priors and DGPs, BNN could be a paper on its own. Thus, no topic is presented with the depth needed. In regards to significance, it is not clear from the paper, how extensive is the family of kernels that can be generated from the prior distribution, given that the proposed model is equivalent to DGPs only in the case of isotropic kernels. In that sense, it is not clear from the paper why this approach would be beneficial over DGPs.\n\n[1] Amar Shah, Andrew Wilson, and Zoubin Ghahramani.

The method has all required features to make kernel based methods practical: it is still an inductive learning method (enable to make predictions for unseen test points) and provides doubly stochastic inducing-point based variational inference (to scale the model to large data set). However, the manuscripts could be improved in some aspects (please read my comments below).\n \n##########################################################################\nPros: \n \n1.\tI think that the method is carefully designed and equipped with all required features to make kernel based methods practical.\n2.\tThe method includes important models (DGPs, BNNs, and infinite BNNs) as special cases.  \n3.\tThe method shows superior performance over DGPs and infinite BNNs on the benchmark data sets. \n \n##########################################################################\nCons: \n \n1.\tSome parts are confusing or unclear. For example, in equation (19b) the dimensions of the matrices are not matched to each other: K(G_{l-1}) \\in R^{N_0 X N_0} but V_l V_l^T in R^{PXP}. In addition, in equation (22) please provide the exact form of Q(\\Omega, {G_{l}}^L_{l-2}, F_{L+1}|X_i). Equation 19 (a,b,c) do not really show how the method can reduce the computational complexity based on inducing points.    \n\n2.\tThe manuscript does not include computational (memory and time) complexities. I also think that the method should be compared to the previous approaches, including deep Gaussian processes with sparse approximation, in terms of these computational complexities. \n  \n#########################################################################\n\nMinor comments:\nI think that it would be better if the authors included more detailed descriptions what \u201ctask-dependent representation\u201d in introduction. \nIn the sentence above equation (7), \u201cthe DKP as an autoregressive process (Fig. 2)\u201d.
