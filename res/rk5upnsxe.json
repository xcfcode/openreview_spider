The\nclaim that DN is less explored is questionable.\n\nA: Please see our general response above. In brief, the difference to\nKrizhevsky is not just constants but the spatial dimension we sum over.\nFurthermore, Krizhevsky et al. use normalization for one particular task while\nwe systematically explore it on several benchmarks. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ: It is not clear whether the Divisive normalization does subtract the mean \nfrom the activation as there is a contradiction in its definition in equation \n1 and 3.\n\nA: Equation (1) is the divisive normalization model as used on the \nneuroscience literature. Equation (3) is our divisive normalization model. We \ndo subtract the mean in all cases. The reason is that divisive normalization \ncan be seen as a non-linear radial transformation which has strong links to \nredundancy reduction and density estimation on natural images and sound (see \nreferences Schwartz/Simoncelli, Lyu/Simoncelli, Sinz/Bethge, Balle/Simoncelli).\nHowever, these links rely on zero mean data (or elementw-ise transformations \nthereof). Therefore, even the neuroscience version often implicitly assumes \nmean centered data.  In practice, we found that mean subtraction is important \nas it helps accelerate the training. We also tried a variant with only mean-\nsubtraction (on BN, LN and DN) and found that the performance is consistently\nlower than divisive normalization, (1% decrease on CIFAR-10, and 3% decrease\non CIFAR-100).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ: This questions whether the \"General Formulation of Normalization\" is\ncorrect.\n\nA: Our model technically includes the case where the mean is not subtracted by\nchoosing A to be empty. As we show in Table 1, different choices of sigma, A,\nand B recover BN, LN, or DN. One exception is the form used in Jarrett et al:\nx |-> x/max(||x||, c), which is not a special case of our model. However, DN\ncan be seen as a smooth, invertible approximation of it, since the function\nvalues for ||x|| -> infty and ||x||->0 are the same and DN is bounded and\nmonotonically increasing (i.e. sigmoidal) in between.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ: It seems that Divisive normalization is used also in Jarrett09, called\nContrast Normalization, with a definition more similar to equation 3\n(subtracting the mean).\n\nA: As we explain in our general points above, our DN differs in important\naspects from Jarrett et al. and Krizhevsky et al. In brief, Krizhevsky et al.\nis invertible, but does not use spatial summation and does not use mean\ncentering (like we do). Jarrett et al. use mean centering but is not generally\ninvertible. As we argue above, we think that these choices matter for\nclassification performance.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ: In case of the RNN experiments, BN may be inferior to DN due to a small \nbatch size.\n\nA: We experimented BN with larger batch size, which helped  BN achieve a\nslightly better performance which was  still worse than DN models. Varying\nbatch size was not considered in our experiments as the original learning rate\nschedule was tied to the number of epochs, and change batch size will end up\nsearching for the best learning rate schedule. In the new set of experiments,\nwe searched for the best learning rate schedule for BN with larger batch size.\nWe include a comparison here, but note that it may not be fair again since DN\nresults were based on smaller mini-batches.\n\nFor ReLU RNN models, we are able to increase the learning by 10 by having a\nbatch size of 120, which leads to the most improvement.\n\nReLU RNN (large batch=120)\nBN large batch:       128\nBN* large batch:      124\nDN small batch:       118 (In the paper)\nDN* small batch:      117 (In the paper)\n\nTanh RNN (large batch=120)\nBN large batch:       131 (Adding L1 did not help)\nDN small batch:       132 (In the paper)\nDN* small batch:      123 (In the paper)\n\nLSTM RNN (large batch=60)\nBN* large batch:      116\nDN* small batch:      102\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ: It is unclear what and how are measured the results shown in Table 10. Also\nit is unclear what are the sizes of the suppression/summation fields for the\nCIFAR and Super Resolution experiments.\n\nA: The plots in table 10 show representative 2d histograms of activations in \nthe first layer before normalization along with the average pairwise mutual\ninformation (MI) and correlation. This is to show that BN increases the\ndependencies between the activations on early layers and that the smoother and\nthe L1 regularizer can decrease those. This could be one of the reasons for\ntheir better performance.\n\nOn CIFAR, the suppression/summation fields are 5x5, 3x3, 3x3 for each\nconvolutional layer.\n\nOn super resolution, the suppression field is 5x5 and and the suppression\nfield is 7x7 for the first two convolutional layers.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ: It is usually better to pick a stronger baseline for the tasks (e.g. the\nwidely available ResNet).\n\nA: Since we submitted the paper, we have been experimenting with ResNet-32 as\na much larger architecture, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The original\narchitecture uses BN by default. If we remove BN, the architecture is very\ndifficult to train or converges to a poor solution. We first reproduced\noriginal BN ResNet-32, with 92.6% on CIFAR-10, and 69.8% on CIFAR-100.\n\nWe then train DN using the same hyperparameters. Importantly, the effect of\nsigma (2.5% gain on CIFAR-100) and L1 regularizer (0.5% gain on CIFAR-100) is\nstill found, even in the presence of other regularization techniques such as\nvarious data augmentation and weight decay in the training. This suggests that\nboth the smoother and L1 regularizer should be included when applying divisive\nnormalized models.\n\nSo far our best DN model  achieves 91.3% on CIFAR-10 and 66.6% on CIFAR-100.\nWhile this performance is lower than the original ResNet, there is certainly\nroom to improve as we have not performed any hyperparameter optimization, and\ninstead have used the same hyperparameters of the original BN ResNet. These\nwere found via extensive tuning with BN, but other hyperparameter settings are\nlikely better for DN.\n\nDuring training the DN network we made an interesting observation:  Since the\nnumber of sigma hyperparameters scales with the number of layers, we found\nthat setting sigma as a learnable parameter for each layer helps the\nperformance (1.3% gain on CIFAR-100). Note, that training this parameter is\nnot possible in the formulation by Jarrett et al. The learned sigma shows a\nclear trend: it tends to decrease with depth (see Fig. 1), and the sigma in the\nlast convolution layer is approaching to 0.\n\nReasons for that effect could be that the overall scale of the data changes\nover layers. Since there seems to be an optimal range for sigma, that range\nwould shift as well. Another reason could be that preserving the scale of the\ndata becomes less and less relevant towards deeper layers classification layer\nand the non-invertible (sigma=0) solution is more helpful in the final\nclassification layer.\n\nFig 1.

Before we address each\nitem individually, we would like to emphasize a few general points.\n\nOur normalization scheme is the first to work well for both DNNs and RNNs.\nPreviously batch normalization (BN) was problematic for RNNs while layer\nnormalization (LN) did not perform well for DNNs. We demonstrate that our\nnormalization scheme performs on par or outperforms BN and LN on several\nbenchmark problems. While our scheme is similar in spirit to the ones used by\nJarrett et al. or Krizhesvky et al., it differs in important aspects that we\nbelieve are important in practice.\n\nOne important feature not present in current normalization schemes is the\nsmoother in the denominator which makes the normalization equation\ninvertible/information preserving (unlike Jarrett, like Krizhevsky). One\ncontribution of our paper is to show that the smoother boosts performance of\nthe normalization scheme (e.g. Figure 5 in Appendix A). While we use an\ninvertible normalization equation of the form x/sqrt(||x||^2 + c), Jarrett et\nal. use a clipping equation of the form x/max(||x||, c) which is only\ninvertible for very small signals (||x||<c).\n\nWe subtract the mean before normalizing (like Jarrett, unlike Krizhevsky). For\nmean centered responses, divisive normalization is a non-linear radial\ntransformation that has strong links to redundancy reduction on natural\nsignals (see references by Schwartz/Wainwright/Simoncelli, Lyu/Simoncelli,\nSinz/Bethge). We show that the L1 regularizer in combination with\nnormalization improves performance for all normalization schemes. We give\npotential explanations for why L1 regularization helps (e.g. Table 10).\n\nThus, while our normalization scheme uses existing elements, we empirically\ndemonstrate which elements are important in practice by means of a systematic\ncomparison of normalization schemes on a diverse set of problems. Our proposed\nnormalization scheme DN* yields better performance on several benchmark tasks,\nhas a wider application range than BN (i.e., RNN, super resolution), and is\neasier to use in practice since it does not require to keep track of\nstatistics during training.\n\nIndividual responses will be posted as direct replies under the comments."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Normalizing the Normalizers: Comparing and Extending Network Normalization Schemes", "abstract": "Normalization techniques have only recently begun to be exploited in supervised learning tasks.

Do you have\nany intuition why BN* performs the best on CIFAR while DN* on the\nsuper-resolution task?\n\nA: We think that the reason why DN* outperforms BN* on super-resolution\nis that BN applies the same statistics to all patches of one\nimage which causes some overall intensity shift. DN, on the other\nhand, use a per image statistic. While this is useful for\nsuper-resolution having a larger pool of data to average over might be\nmore advantageous in the case of CIFAR. DN* only averages over a\nbatchsize of one, although it uses all channels. In the case of CIFAR\nthe bigger batch size for BN* might just be more helpful. Also, CIFAR\nimages are pretty small. Therefore, the difference in the spatial\naveraging range between BN* and DN* might not be relevant here.\n\n---\nQ: Do you think that it would be possible to see similar effects on\nlarger datasets? Such as ILSVRC etc.\n\nA: Yes, we expect that. Larger datasets with more classes and variety\nrequire bigger networks, so regularization and normalization is just\nas important there.\n---\nQ: What are the radii of the summation R_A and suppression fields R_B?\n\nThe radius of DN for CIFAR and RNN experiments are mentioned in the \npaper. Cifar: Local window size 5x5, 3x3, 3x3 (for each conv layer), \nand for RNN, 30 for LSTM and 60 for RNN.\n\n---\nQ: Would it be possible to elaborate more about what is visualized in\ntable 10? Is there some intuition why the BN and LN have almost\ndiagonal structure, while additional L1 regularization removes that?\n\nA: We visualize the joint histogram of filter responses (the v's) for\n4 pairs of filters to visualize correlations between those responses\non lower levels. We do not yet understand why the unregularized\nnormalization schemes can lead to such strong correlations. We do,\nhowever, have an intuition why the L1 regularizer helps decrease them.\nA possible explanation for this effect is that the L1 regularizer\nmight have a similar effect as maximum likelihood estimation of an\nindependent Laplace distribution. To see that, let $\np_v\\left(\\mathbf{v}\\right) \\propto\\exp\\left(-\\left\\Vert\n\\mathbf{v}\\right\\Vert _{1}\\right) $ and $\\mathbf{x}=W^{-1}\\mathbf{v}$\nwith full rank invertible matrix $W$. Under this model\n$p_x\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right) =p_v\\left(W\\mathbf x\\right)\\left|\\det\nW\\right|$.

Authors investigate various combinations of normalization techniques together with additional regularizations. \n\nThe paper makes few interesting empirical observations, such that the L1 regularizer on top of the activations is relatively useful for most of the tasks. \n\nIn general, it seems that this work can be significantly improved by providing more precise study of existing normalization techniques. Also, studying more closely the overall volumes of the summation and suppression fields (e.g. how many samples one needs to collect for a robust enough normalization) would be useful.\n\nIn more detail, the work seems to have the following issues:\n* Divisive normalization, is used extensively in Krizhevsky12 (LRN). It is almost exactly the same definition as in equation 1, however with slightly different constants. Therefore claiming that it is less explored is questionable.\n* It is not clear whether the Divisive normalization does subtract the mean from the activation as there is a contradiction in its definition in equation 1 and 3. This questions whether the \"General Formulation of Normalization\" is correct.\n* In seems that Divisive normalization is used also in Jarrett09, called Contrast Normalization, with a definition more similar to equation 3 (subtracting the mean).\n* In case of the RNN experiments, it would be more clear to provide the absolute size of the summation and suppression field as BN may be inferior to DN due to a small batch size.\n* It is unclear what and how are measured the results shown in Table 10. Also it is unclear what are the sizes of the suppression/summation fields for the CIFAR and Super Resolution experiments.\n\nMinor, relatively irrelevant issues:\n* It is usually better to pick a stronger baseline for the tasks. The selected CIFAR model from Caffe seems to be quite far from the state of the art on the CIFAR dataset.

The framework encompases layer normalization, batch normalization and local contrast normalization. It also suggests decorrelating the inputs through L1 regularization of the activations. Results are reported on three tasks: CIFAR classification, PTB Language models and super resolution on Berkeley dataset.\n\n*** Review Summary ***\n\nOverall, I feel it is good to refresh the community about local normalization schemes and other mechanism to favor unit competitions. The paper reads well and reports results on various setups, with sufficient discussion. \n\n*** Detailed Review ***\n\nThe paper is clear and reads well. It lacks a few reference to prior research. Also I am surprised that \"Local Contrast Normalization\" is not said anywhere, as it is a common terminology in the neural network and vision literature. \n\nIt is unclear to me why you chose to pair L1 regularization of the activation and normalization. They seem complementary. Would it make sense to apply L1 regularization to the baseline to highlight it is helpful on its own. Overall, it seems the only thing that brings a consistent improvement across all setups.\n\nOn related work, maybe it would be worthwhile to insist that Local Contrast Normalization (LCN) used to be very popular [Pinto et al, 2008, Jarret et al 2009, Sermanet et al 2012; Quoc Le 2013] and effective. It is great to connect this litterature to current work on layer normalization and batch normalization. Similarly, sparsity or group sparsity of the activation has shown effective in the past [Rozell et al 08, Kavukcuoglu et al 09] and need more exposure today.\n\nFinally, since dropout is so popular but interact poorly with normalizer estimates, I feel it would be worthwhile to report results with dropout beyond the baseline and discuss how the different normalization scheme interact with it.\n\nOverall, I feel it is good to refresh the community about local normalization schemes and other mechanism to favor unit competitions. The paper reads well and reports results on various setups, with sufficent discussion. \n\n*** References ***\n\nJarrett, Kevin, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Yann Lecun. \"What is the best multi-stage architecture for object recognition?.\" 2009 IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision.
