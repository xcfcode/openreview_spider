Most reviewers raised a few concerns around the experiments, baselines, datasets used and motivation. A few pointed out that the paper is hard to read - for a person without heavy database theory literature, which includes most of ICLR readers. While this paper may read well for the folks in the domain, authors should consider revising the paper to be more inclusive so that it can be read more widely. The motivation of the problem was also another point that many reviewers have mentioned (perhaps related to the language issues above) that some noted that you may not always want equivariance in relational DB and other noted that the paper did not sufficiently demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods. Reviewers also univocally commented on experiments - many voiced the lack of baselines (not even any simple one). Authors wrote back to defend that there is no similar method and even simple tensor factorization isn\u2019t applicable. That makes me wonder - is there really no single simple method you can compare with? If nobody had solution for this problem, is this a problem worth solving? Reviewers also encouraged to use larger (beyond Kaggle dataset) real-world datasets to strengthen the paper. All the points raised by reviewers suggests that this paper can benefit from another round of nontrivial editing before it\u2019s ready for the show.\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks", "authors": ["Devon Graham", "Siamak Ravanbakhsh"], "authorids": ["drgraham@cs.ubc.ca", "siamak@cs.mcgill.ca"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "relational model", "knowledge graph", "exchangeability", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "We propose a feed-forward layer that is informed by the ER model of relational data and show that it is the most expressive linear layer possible under given the equivariance constraints.

Similar to the cited previous work, they encode sets of objects (in this case the tuples of a relational database) with a permutation invariant function. They use a parameter tieing scheme to enforce this invariance.\n\nI don\u2019t find the paper to be particularly well motivated. Relational DBs are not necessarily a setting where you would always want equivariance. While the ordering of tuples do not matter, relations are often asymmetrical. Further, the idea of concatenating all tuples of a relational DB to be passed through a particular feed forward layer is infeasible for all but the smallest datasets. Real world databases such as knowledge bases contains millions to billions of entries. Scaling issues aside, the experiments do not actually show that this method outperforms any reasonable baselines such as a simple tensor factorization. \n\nI also found it particularly hard to follow the descriptions of the methods. A few specific points:\n- The text and notation in the beginning of section 2 could be a lot clearer. I had to read these paragraphs multiple times to pick out precisely what you were trying to say. Maybe have the set of relations be [R] like your other sets rather than a different script R. \n- In the next paragraph you say \u201cA particular relation R is a multiset if it contains multiple copies of the same entity\u201d but you previously defined R to be a set of instances and not entities. I think you need to be more consistent with your terminology since the differences between type level entities and instances is important for your definitions and as you noted in your first footnote, these terms are often used very differently.\n- This explanation could be helped a lot by improving the figure. The caption and images are both very dense but still requires a lot of coreference. For example, labeling the entities and relations with their ids in figure 1a directly would make it much easier to mentally map to what you are explaining in the caption. Also figure 1c is not at all clear.\n\nLastly, the methodology seems quite incremental over the previous work. A lot of the context and background that was sent to the appendix should be included in the main paper, particularly the relation to related work\n\n\nedits:\ndouble \u2018the\u2019 in abstract \u201clinear complexity in the the data \u201c", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks", "authors": ["Devon Graham", "Siamak Ravanbakhsh"], "authorids": ["drgraham@cs.ubc.ca", "siamak@cs.mcgill.ca"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "relational model", "knowledge graph", "exchangeability", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "We propose a feed-forward layer that is informed by the ER model of relational data and show that it is the most expressive linear layer possible under given the equivariance constraints.

A major difference is that knowledge-graphs do not have special accommodation for entity types. This difference also explains why deep models used for knowledge-graph completion are based on graph neural networks (e.g., Schlichtkrull et al\u201918). There are also graph databases (Robinson et al'13), that follow the semantics of knowledge graphs, but in this work, we are concerned with relational databases that use the entity-relationship diagrams. \n\nIn addition to the appendix, we briefly address this connection to knowledge-graphs also in the introduction.

We believe this should further count towards the novelty and timeliness of our contribution. Please let us know if you have any particular method in mind. \n\nREVIEW: \"No effective real-world datasets are used in the experiments. The authors only take synthesized toy dataset in their experiments.

This dataset is at the limit where we can still pass the whole data through our model on a typical GPU (this can be verified by running our linked code). Note that due to lack of subsampling techniques, at this point we can only work with small datasets. \n\nREVIEW: \"In terms of missing record prediction, why do the authors embed, e.g., the COURSE, in this way but not the other ways?

Are there other embedding techniques, e.g., Matrix Factorization and Skip-gram frameworks like that in Word2VEC, can be used for your purposes?\"\n\nRESPONSE: We do not know of any embedding method that can be applied to relational data with more than one relation. Matrix and tensor factorization methods apply to settings where we have a single relation (across potentially multiple entities) \u2014 for example a STUDENT-COURSE relation, or STUDENT-COURSE-PROF relation. This is the setting studied by Hartford et al\u201918. Since we show that our model reduces to their model in this setting, comparison to the matrix and tensor factorization would amount to reproducing their results. In our setting, we have multiple tensors (see figure 1) that share some of their dimensions, as expressed by the ER diagram, and we need to perform joint factorization. We are not aware of any factorization methods for this setting. We will make this clear in the revised version.\n\nCould you please elaborate on what you mean by embedding the COURSE in this way? \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks", "authors": ["Devon Graham", "Siamak Ravanbakhsh"], "authorids": ["drgraham@cs.ubc.ca", "siamak@cs.mcgill.ca"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "relational model", "knowledge graph", "exchangeability", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "We propose a feed-forward layer that is informed by the ER model of relational data and show that it is the most expressive linear layer possible under given the equivariance constraints.

Relational DBs are not necessarily a setting where you would always want equivariance. While the ordering of tuples do not matter, relations are often asymmetrical.\"\n\nRESPONSE: The notion of \u201casymmetry\u201d of relations raised in the review is unclear to us. If for example, you mean \u201cstudent-course\u201d relation is different from \u201ccourse-student\u201d relation, then we agree. However, we do not understand your concern. Could you please elaborate? \n\nREVIEW: \"Further, the idea of concatenating all tuples of a relational DB to be passed through a particular feed forward layer is infeasible for all but the smallest datasets. Real world databases such as knowledge bases contains millions to billions of entries.  \"\n\nRESPONSE: Practicality is an important point that we also address in the paper. The model produced here does not perform any subsampling of the database, which is essential for its application to large datasets. We have seen successful examples of subsampling for graphs, and matrices recently. In the case of a relational database, subsampling is more involved, as one has to deal with variable amounts of sparsity across different relations (tables). This is left for future work.\n\nREVIEW: \"Scaling issues aside, the experiments do not actually show that this method outperforms any reasonable baselines such as a simple tensor factorization.\"\n\nRESPONSE: We could not use tensor-factorization as a baseline in our experiments. Tensor factorization applies to settings where we have a single relation \u2014 for example, a user-move relation, or user-item-tag relation. This is the setting studied by Hartford et al\u201918. Since we show that our model reduces to their model in this setting, comparison to tensor factorization would amount to reproducing their results. To use the language of tensor factorization in our setup: we have multiple tensors that share some dimensions and need to be jointly factorized. We do not know of any factorization method for this task.\n\n\nREVIEW: \"- The text and notation in the beginning of section 2...\"\n\nRESPONSE: Based on your feedback we will try to make this part more clear (note that Using [R] for the set of relations would be misleading as the notation [X] is often used when X is ordinal or has an ordinal index, while in our paper, R is defined to be a set.)\n\nREVIEW: \"In the next paragraph you say \u201cA particular relation R is a multiset if it contains multiple copies of the same entity\u201d but you previously defined R to be a set of instances and not entities. I think you need to be more consistent with your terminology...\"\n\nRESPONSE: We never defined R as a set of instances (could you please identify lines that misled you?

We use a running example along with several heavily captioned figures to help the reader get a visual summary of the main ideas.

One novel contribution of this paper is the identification of the symmetry group for the relational model. Sections 2 and 3 formalize the representation and derive this symmetry group. \n\nREVIEW: \"In both theory and experiment, the paper does not demonstrate the advantage of the weight tying method compared to an untied baseline...\"\n\nRESPONSE: The number of parameters in a fully connected layer applied to a relational database grows quadratically with the size of the database. Even if we could construct this for a small toy problem, such a model will have a very poor generalization. That might be why fully connected models have not been used as a baseline in the related equivariant models (e.g., see Hartford et al\u201918 or Maron et al\u201918). In theory, it is known that in terms of sample complexity, an equivariant layer is comparable to a fully connected layer that uses data-augmentation via the symmetry group. In this case, due to the exponential size of the group, such data-augmentation is infeasible, further motivating our model. We will add this explanation to the revised version.\n\nREVIEW: \"This paper also has very weak relationship with deep neural networks \u2026 \"\n\nRESPONSE: Could you elaborate? This paper is about building deep neural networks for relational data.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks", "authors": ["Devon Graham", "Siamak Ravanbakhsh"], "authorids": ["drgraham@cs.ubc.ca", "siamak@cs.mcgill.ca"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "relational model", "knowledge graph", "exchangeability", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "We propose a feed-forward layer that is informed by the ER model of relational data and show that it is the most expressive linear layer possible under given the equivariance constraints.

Results on the generality of the tying scheme are presented, as well as some experimental validation.\n\nThe paper extends several previously-proposed lines of work in statistical relational learning, including the work of Hartford et al. (2018) to multiple relations. In contrast to this earlier paper, which builds its argument step by step with great clarity (helped by illustrations), the current paper would prove hard to read to an ICLR audience, since most of its language and methods borrow more from the database theory literature. Since the proposed tying scheme is quite close to that of Hartford et al. (2018), one way to present the paper could be to construct the argument in such a way as to emphasize the difference with the previously-proposed scheme, thereby far better outlining the current contribution.\n\nIn addition, the experimental validation leaves much to be desired. In the synthetic data experiments (e.g. Figure 3), there is no guidance as to how to judge the quality of the resulting embedding. Also, it would be helpful to contrast the performance of the proposed approach against alternatives on a wider variety of datasets, such as MovieLens, Flixster, Netflix. (See the methodology followed by Hartford et al., 2018).\n\nAll in all, even though the proposed approach could usefully extend the state of the literature, the paper in its current form would need additional work before recommending acceptance at ICLR.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper835/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks", "authors": ["Devon Graham", "Siamak Ravanbakhsh"], "authorids": ["drgraham@cs.ubc.ca", "siamak@cs.mcgill.ca"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "relational model", "knowledge graph", "exchangeability", "equivariance"], "TL;DR": "We propose a feed-forward layer that is informed by the ER model of relational data and show that it is the most expressive linear layer possible under given the equivariance constraints.

The proposed feed-forward layer has linear complexity in the the data and can be used for both inductive and transductive reasoning about relational databases, including database embedding, and the prediction of missing records. This, provides a principled theoretical foundation for the application of deep learning to one of the most abundant forms of data.", "pdf": "/pdf/21dfe09ba3972eea6ef7048626419f4c8f4c791a.pdf", "code": "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/10bd3f10-0c97-42ac-b2f1-d21a838b007f/", "paperhash": "graham|equivariant_entityrelationship_networks", "original_pdf": "/attachment/3022efd54ed7c244d37025b74ee6fad9b223751c.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\ngraham2020equivariant,\ntitle={Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks},\nauthor={Devon Graham and Siamak Ravanbakhsh},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkx6p6EFDr}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
