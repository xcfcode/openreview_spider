The approach is based on various components, like a 3D feature volume, a bounding box detector, and a disentanglement network. Neural rendering (e.g. recomposing the various disentangled parts into an image) is used as the learning signal for self-supervision. Various applications of this representation  are shown, examples are few-shot shape learning and Visual Question Answering.\n\n--- Strengths ---\n\nSome applications that are enabled by the representations are very interesting. Disentangling style and shape for example allows to detect object independently of style (something easily done by humans) and generation of scenes from language utterances. Overall, it seems like a good direction to try to go for a full 3D(+style) representation to get more flexible and general models. The experiments indicate that the main concepts help in the down-stream tasks.\n\n--- Weaknesses ---\n\nOnly synthetic samples are shown. Since the approach is fully self-supervised, it should be possible to apply it to real images. The authors show quantitative results on one, apparently, real dataset \"Real veggies\", but no qualitative samples are shown to give the reader an indication on how realistic this dataset is. Is it realistic? If not, what is preventing applying this approach to more realistic images and objects?\n\nThe other propose a very elaborate, modular pipeline. While this modularity does explicitely enable some of the applications that are shown, it also could be a weakness, as some modules present single points of failure which might be hard to recover from (for example when the 3D object detector fails). This could be alleviated by either showing results on realistic data and/or a controlled studies of how robust the approach is the to failures of individual parts (e.g. what happens when the detector is inaccurate?). \n\nThe paper is a bit hard to read because it is crowded. I suspect that it due to he many concepts that are introduced. The  main contribution clearly is the self-supervised learning of the representation, but a sizeable part of the paper discusses down-stream applications (which are non-trivial and are thus not discussed in sufficient detail), while other parts (for example the feature selection) would require a bit more space to be easier to understand. \n\n--- Other ---\n\nThe example for one-shot scene generation in Figure 1 is exceptionally clean. Is this a real example that was rendered by the proposed approach?\n\nAre you planning to release the code? An elaborate system like this would benefit strongly from this.\n\nI suspect that the submission is severely over length. Starting from page 5, the font size is much smaller than the default font size.\n\nTypos: page 3: \"operation operation\"\n\n-- Summary ---\n\nThe proposed representation is interesting, but the huge number of applications makes the paper inaccessible. I'd argue it would be beneficial to explore and understand the representation and pipeline on a more fundamental level (i.e. can it be learned on real images? what about individual inaccuracies? when does the approach fail? what is the influence of the granularity of the 3D feature map? ....), than to jump right into elaborate higher level tasks.\n\n\n--- Post rebuttal ---\nI'd like to thank the authors for the response.

This is a great goal, but in my view the paper does not deliver on that front. There are several issues from my perspective\n\n1) The model formulation aims to disentangle shape from style in a particular formulation. To achieve training of this disentanglement it requires large amounts of multi-view data of highly simplified (and in this case simulated) scenes of at most few objects at the time. I am not convinced that we will ever have such data except for highly specialized situations. Unfortunately, the paper does not discuss this major limitation and does not make any attempt to convince the reader that this is a sensible starting point for further work. The only attempt to use real data is a custom dataset called \"real world veggie\" that has never been used before and it's characteristics are very unclear (number of classes, number of images, number of scenes, etc - also no sample images are given)\n\n2) In order to show the \"importance of using disentangled 3D feature representation\" one would expect a set of experiments that shows comparable models with and without some form of disentanglement. However, the paper does not seem to contain any such experiments as far as I understood.\n\n3) While there are several experiments given, it is unclear how valuable the results and comparisons are. It seems that most if not all of the explored settings have not been addressed in the other works that this paper compares to. E.g. the paper [Mao et al 2019] does not seem to report any of the results given in Table 2. Similarly, the referenced papers that I checked from table 1 did not seem to report those results or this respective setting. This makes it very hard to understand if the proposed approach really has any benefit when it is used only in non-published and non-standard settings\n\nSo while the model formulation is quite sensible and combines in a meaningful way previous ideas and approaches, it remains unclear what can be taken away from this paper beyond the rather specific experiments mostly on simulated data (and some unclear real world veggie experiments)\n\n\n========= post rebuttal ========\n\nThanks for adding the experiments for Replica - these at least seem to suggest that the approach can work on more complex scenes than shown initially in the paper. \n\nI still think the training scheme and required data is relatively specific for this approach that it is hard to see that it will generalize beyond - but that is probably fine for a research paper.  \n\nthat addresses Q1\n\nfor Q2 - please include some information in the main paper - not everyone will check the supplement and the paper should be self-contained. \n\nI still find the comparisons and ablations weak as the particular training setup and model are the key contribution for the paper and thus without a proper ablation it is hard to know what exactly to take away. Therefore I still remain somewhat skeptical but have raised my score somewhat. To me the paper is still borderline and thus somewhere between 5 and 6 really.

We are currently conducting our experiments on the Replica dataset of Straub et al., which contains photorealistic indoor objects. We will update the paper with these new results soon.   \n\n**Q2: Robustness of the approach to the failures of individual modules.**\n\nIn contrast to existing work with modular architecture where each module is learned separately, our model consists of modules that can be trained jointly end-to-end with the final objective, which allows them to adapt to a new environment. We agree that our model does depend on a good 3D detector that is trained separately from the rest of the model. In our experiments, we found our model performs comparably well when replacing the ground truth 3D boxes with detection from a  learned 3D detector. We measure the performance of our model with a learned detector,  and it achieves 0.57 and 0.62 in 1-shot style and shape retrieval tasks respectively. Model with gt object proposals performs 0.61 and 0.70. We will include similar comparisons with the Replica dataset. \n\n**Q3: More space for model and training details. Length of the paper.**\n\nYes, you are right, the core technique novelty is to propose a self-supervised learning paradigm for learning the disentangled and 3D-aware representation. To emphasize the importance of learning such representation space, we include several down-stream applications that are critical for machine perception and concept learning. Thanks for your suggestion. We will move more details for the feature learning part to the main text. We have addressed the font size issue and the paper is within the 9-page limit.\n\n**Q4:  Are the images in figure 1 generated by the model?**\n\nNo, those renders were generated from a simulator, with the intent of better explaining our tasks. You can find our neural renders in Figure 5. and supplementary videos.\n\n**Q5: Will you release your code?**\n\nYes, we will release our code and datasets for all the applications mentioned in the paper.\n\n**Q6: Typo \"operation operation\"**\n\nThanks for pointing it out. We have fixed it in the latest PDF.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning", "authorids": ["~Mihir_Prabhudesai1", "~Shamit_Lal1", "~Darshan_Patil1", "~Hsiao-Yu_Tung1", "~Adam_W_Harley1", "~Katerina_Fragkiadaki1"], "authors": ["Mihir Prabhudesai", "Shamit Lal", "Darshan Patil", "Hsiao-Yu Tung", "Adam W Harley", "Katerina Fragkiadaki"], "keywords": ["Disentanglement", "Few Shot Learning", "3D Vision", "VQA"], "abstract": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.

It aims at learning disentangled 3D representation of input images. The authors show that these methods can be applied to few-shot recognition, visual question-answering (VQA), view prediction, and image generation from texts.\n\nThe paper is well-written. It's impressive that the authors were able to build such an integrated system with so many modules. The experiments are quite extensive.\n\nMy concerns are mostly about experimental evaluation. There are some important studies missing, and other results not well-justified.\n\nFirst, some important ablation studies are missing, especially in Section 4.1. The authors have used three different techniques to improve the few-shot recognition performance: 1) multi-view predictive learning, 2) content-style disentanglement, and 3) optimization-based prototypical network (the authors used gradient descent to find the rotation of the observation w.r.t. the prototype). However, the only ablation study available in Table 1 is the 3DP-Net, which uses only (1) multi-view predictive learning. Moreover, I suggest authors test the performance of other algorithms for few-shot recognition, for example, a very simple baseline algorithm from Chen (2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04390 ). Is the proposed representation algorithm only working with prototypical networks?\n\nSecond, Table 2 also misses an important baseline. Looking at the in-domain test set, we have seen that NSCL-2D has a better performance than D3DP -- the authors explained that this is because the NSCL-2D uses ImageNet pretraining. What will be the performance of NSCL without ImageNet pretraining? On the one-shot generalization test split: what will be the performance of D3DP without 3D shape primitive and without shape/style disentanglement? It seems that even with one of these two features, the proposed D3DP still has worse performance than the 2D network. It'd be great to hear from the authors if there is any intuition on the result.\n\nI also have serious concerns about the generality and applicability of the claimed shape-style disentanglement. From the results in Table 1 (comparing D3DP and 3DP) and Table 2 (comparing D3DP w/. and w/o. style/content disentanglement), it seems that the shape-style disentanglement has shown great importance in few-shot learning settings. But, in \"style features\", how should materials and colors be disentangled; in \"content features\", how should object textures and shapes be disentangled? The limitation on generality will greatly restrict the application of this framework in real-world images. \n\nThis is also related to another minor comment about the setup of few-shot style recognition in Table 1. In CLEVR, there are 8 colors and 2 materials. So the \"16 style classes\" in the paper indicates that the authors are treating pairs of (color, material) as the label for objects. Such a design will not scale up wrt the type of attributes. I'd love to hear more justifications from authors. And this should be more clearly indicated in the main paper as well.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate the response and have adjusted my score accordingly.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning", "authorids": ["~Mihir_Prabhudesai1", "~Shamit_Lal1", "~Darshan_Patil1", "~Hsiao-Yu_Tung1", "~Adam_W_Harley1", "~Katerina_Fragkiadaki1"], "authors": ["Mihir Prabhudesai", "Shamit Lal", "Darshan Patil", "Hsiao-Yu Tung", "Adam W Harley", "Katerina Fragkiadaki"], "keywords": ["Disentanglement", "Few Shot Learning", "3D Vision", "VQA"], "abstract": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.

But this is not a restriction to the proposed learning framework. To handle deformed objects, one approach is to simply use a pooling operation to pool the 3D prototypes to 1D prototypes and conduct the matching in this 1D representation space. The major drawback of this approach is that the model can not infer object pose by rotation check since the representation already loses its 3 spatial dimensions. A better approach would be to learn 3D part or 3D keypoint detectors as opposed to whole object detectors, and then quantize and correspond the parts using our approach. We leave this to future work. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning", "authorids": ["~Mihir_Prabhudesai1", "~Shamit_Lal1", "~Darshan_Patil1", "~Hsiao-Yu_Tung1", "~Adam_W_Harley1", "~Katerina_Fragkiadaki1"], "authors": ["Mihir Prabhudesai", "Shamit Lal", "Darshan Patil", "Hsiao-Yu Tung", "Adam W Harley", "Katerina Fragkiadaki"], "keywords": ["Disentanglement", "Few Shot Learning", "3D Vision", "VQA"], "abstract": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.

How can the shape features be further disentangled to occupancy and texture?**\n\nYes, you are correct. Currently, we are treating each combination of material/color as a unique category specifically in Table 1. However, disentangling these attributes of unsupervised should be possible. One solution is to include attribute-specific inductive biases in our network architecture, e.g., the material is a much finer style as compared to color, and thus it can be disentangled by doing AdaIn at a different spatial resolution, as suggested by the work of Karras et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf). Similarly, there are biases that can be induced to disentangle shape into occupancy and texture. We will leave this for future work. \n\n\n\nThank you for your constructive criticism, Please refer to Table 1 and 2 in the pdf, for the newly added results.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning", "authorids": ["~Mihir_Prabhudesai1", "~Shamit_Lal1", "~Darshan_Patil1", "~Hsiao-Yu_Tung1", "~Adam_W_Harley1", "~Katerina_Fragkiadaki1"], "authors": ["Mihir Prabhudesai", "Shamit Lal", "Darshan Patil", "Hsiao-Yu Tung", "Adam W Harley", "Katerina Fragkiadaki"], "keywords": ["Disentanglement", "Few Shot Learning", "3D Vision", "VQA"], "abstract": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.

In table 1, we do compare D3DP w/o. style/content disentanglement which we call as E3DP. Thanks for your suggestion on more ablation study on the prototypical networks. We replaced the nearest neighbour search of prototypes, with a linear layer which directly predicts the class probabilities, we call this network D3D. We have included results of our model without the prototypical networks In Table 1. Here are the results on the CLEVR dataset for 1-shot retrieval:  \n\n|Methods|Style|Shape|\n|---|---|---|\n|D3DP|**0.61**|**0.70**|\n|D3D|0.26|0.40|\n\nAs can be seen, the nearest neighbour search on prototypes plays a key role for few-shot retrieval.\n\n**Q2: Does the algorithm only work with prototypical networks?**\n\nNo, our model still works without the prototypical networks, e.g., one can directly use the disentangled features to retrieve similar objects or compare attribute similarity between objects. Empirically, we found that including the prototypical networks will yield higher accuracy in few-shot concept learning since it computes the cluster mean by considering several instances as opposed to one. In addition, having explicit prototypes also allows us to add new object categories without further training. \n\n**Q3: Comparison with Chen et al. , 2020**\n\nTo train the feature extractor of Chen et al, it requires many labelled \u201csets\u201d of images where a set of images are labelled as \u201cbelonging to the same category.\u201d  In contrast, our model is completely unsupervised and does not need such labelled data. We have included more comparison with this line of work in the introduction. To satisfy your request, in Table 1 we added a comparison with their Meta-Baseline model trained on Imagenet. We used the pre-trained model provided by them, in their open-source code repository. Here are the results on CLEVR dataset for 1-shot retrieval:\n\n|Methods|Style|Shape|\n|---|---|---|\n|D3DP|**0.61**|0.70|\n|Chen et al.|0.36|**0.75**|\n\nChen et al. seem to outperform our model in shape classification since similar shape categories are present in ImageNet, but due to lack of style categories in Imagenet, it significantly underperforms in the latter.\n\n**Q4: Comparison with NSCL without Imagenet pretraining**\n\nWe did include a baseline called  2.5D NSCL, which takes RGB-D image as input and does not use any Imagent pretraining. Changing inputs from RGB-D images to RGB images for 2D CNN models usually do not change much of the performance. To validate the point, we have included the results of 2D NSCL without Imagenet pretraining in Table 2. Here are the results on the In domain test set of Table 2:\n\n|Methods|10|25|50|100|250|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ours|**0.809**|**0.872**|**0.902**|**0.923**|**0.939**|\n|2D NSCL w/o ImgNet|0.514|0.624|0.682|0.844|0.931|\n\nAs can be seen, our model significantly outperforms 2D NSCL w/o Imagenet pretraining.\n\n**Q5: D3DP without 3D shape primitive and without shape/style disentanglement in table 2?**\n\nRemoving both of the modules will further degrade the performance. Thanks for this suggestion, we have added this ablation in table 2. Following are the results on the In domain test set:\n\n|Methods|10|25|50|100|250|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ours|**0.775**|**0.836**|**0.834**|**0.828**|**0.845**|\n|Ours w/o 3D & w/o style/shape|0.608|0.681|0.688|0.692|0.701|\n\n**Q6: Explanation for why D3DPNet ablations performed worse than 2D models in table 2.**\n\nWe attribute this to the fact that we are using a limited resolution to create the 3D feature maps. One major drawback of using 3D feature maps is that these feature maps, which are indeed 4D tensors, will take a lot of GPU memory. The hardware constraint puts a limit on the resolution we can run for the 3D grids.  it\u2019s costly for us to create a 3d grid that has the same resolution as RGB images, while 2D models can easily use high-resolution feature maps and thus result in higher performance. To address the resolution problem, we believe that integrating implicit functions with these voxel features can help us tackle this issue, similar to the Convolutional Occupancy Networks of Peng et al. We would leave this to future work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning", "authorids": ["~Mihir_Prabhudesai1", "~Shamit_Lal1", "~Darshan_Patil1", "~Hsiao-Yu_Tung1", "~Adam_W_Harley1", "~Katerina_Fragkiadaki1"], "authors": ["Mihir Prabhudesai", "Shamit Lal", "Darshan Patil", "Hsiao-Yu Tung", "Adam W Harley", "Katerina Fragkiadaki"], "keywords": ["Disentanglement", "Few Shot Learning", "3D Vision", "VQA"], "abstract": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.

We conduct most of our experiments using the CLEVR Dataset since it is a benchmark dataset for testing generalization on compositional concepts, as used in NSCL (Mao et al., 2019). The dataset contains cluttered scenes with up to 10 objects, which makes object detection and recognition particularly hard since many objects are heavily occluded. Our model outperforms the previous method since it learns to (1) predict the occluded part of the objects through self-supervised view prediction and (2) detect/match objects with view-invariant 3D feature representation as opposed to view-dependent 2D feature map commonly used in previous work, and thus can be less affected by the occlusions and camera views.\n\nTo satisfy your request, we are currently conducting our experiments on the Replica dataset of Straub et. al., which contains photorealistic indoor scenes. We will update the paper with these new results during the rebuttal phase.\n\n\n\n\n**Q2: Details for the Real Veggie Dataset.**\n\nThe Real veggie dataset contains 800 scenes of 1 to 6 vegetables placed on a table randomly. The dataset is collected using a single Kinect Camera and it contains 6 style and 7 shape classes in total. The total number of images in each scene is 6. We did include these details in Section 4.1 and Section A of supplementary. \n\n\n**Q3: Comparison between existing models with and without disentanglement.**\n\nWe did include a comparison of our model with and without disentanglement in Table 1 and 2. Our model without disentanglement is identical to GRNNs of Tung et al., 2019. While your suggestion sounds reasonable, directly applying the disentanglement technique on other existing 2D-to-3D models is non-trivial since most 2D-to-3D do not operate in a feature space, and thus they cannot be trained end-to-end with the disentanglement objectives. \n\n**Q4: Experiment settings compared to previous work.**\n\nWe have compared our model against SOTA baselines with similar metrics in each of the tasks. Mao et al 2019 is the SOTA in VQA for a low-label regime. While Mao et al. provided 100 labeled images for the models to adapt to new concepts, here we post a much more challenging setup where only 10 or 25 labeled images are provided for adaptation. The setup is more close to a real-world scenario where labeled data (from humans) are extremely sparse and unlabeled data (from robots) are unlimited.  In addition, we compare with Haung et al, the SOTA method in unsupervised style/content disentanglement. Although Huang et al. did not report any object retrieval/recognition accuracy in their paper, object retrieval accuracy is a common metric used in measuring the quality of different feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best models to compare against. We would be happy to compare against other competitive baselines if you have any suggestions on this.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3026/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning", "authorids": ["~Mihir_Prabhudesai1", "~Shamit_Lal1", "~Darshan_Patil1", "~Hsiao-Yu_Tung1", "~Adam_W_Harley1", "~Katerina_Fragkiadaki1"], "authors": ["Mihir Prabhudesai", "Shamit Lal", "Darshan Patil", "Hsiao-Yu Tung", "Adam W Harley", "Katerina Fragkiadaki"], "keywords": ["Disentanglement", "Few Shot Learning", "3D Vision", "VQA"], "abstract": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.

The object-centric disentangling and 3D shape prototype learning seem to play complementary roles for the results. \n\n-The success of the proposed method seems to be limited to the data being considered in this paper, rigid 3D objects with different appearances. It is not clear how the proposed methods, e.g. AdaIn disentangling and rotation invariant prototype can be easily generalized to other scenarios including deformation (pointed out in the paper) and part-based composition.

Our networks incorporate architectural biases that reflect the image formation process, 3D  geometry of the world scene, and shape-style interplay. They are trained end-to-end self-supervised by predicting views in static scenes, alongside a small number of 3D object boxes. Objects and scenes are represented in terms of 3D feature grids in the bottleneck of the network. We show the proposed 3D neural representations are compositional: they can generate novel 3D scene feature maps by mixing object shapes and styles, resizing and adding the resulting object 3D feature maps over background scene feature maps. We show object detectors trained on hallucinated 3D neural scenes generalize better to novel environments. We show classifiers for object categories, color, materials, and spatial relationships trained over the  disentangled 3D feature sub-spaces generalize better with dramatically fewer exemplars over the current state-of-the-art, and enable a visual question answering system that uses them as its modules to generalize one-shot to novel objects in the scene.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "prabhudesai|disentangling_3d_prototypical_networks_for_fewshot_concept_learning", "one-sentence_summary": "We present neural architectures that disentangle RGB-D images into objects\u2019 shapes and styles and a map of the background scene, and explore their applications for few-shot 3D object detection and few-shot concept classification.", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/55d4429cb369a74f8edaaae4ecc9378602af4409.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/b42e4e31403f7d4fdb789fb870cace1f71e6bb86.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Poster", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nprabhudesai2021disentangling,\ntitle={Disentangling 3D Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Concept Learning},\nauthor={Mihir Prabhudesai and Shamit Lal and Darshan Patil and Hsiao-Yu Tung and Adam W Harley and Katerina Fragkiadaki},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=-Lr-u0b42he}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
