I did not use piecewise linear densities, as I consider that a separate design decision.\n\n> In general, due to all these differences, it seems to me it's too early to call out a \"winner\", and I'm not quite following your claim that your method is better.\n\nI only meant to claim that redefining derivatives works better than uniform noise when everything else is kept the same as in our paper (training procedure, network architecture, etc), which is of course the only thing the figure shows. It may well be that adding uniform noise works better in other contexts, e.g., when the architecture or the entropy model are different (GSMs vs piecewise linear). Sorry if I did not make that clear somewhere. Your overall algorithm clearly performs better, and it will be interesting to figure out the deciding differences.\n\nRegarding RD plots, I am not doubting that different ways of visualizing the same results can influence the perception of these results (this seems true even for the simplest results, e.g. classification accuracy vs classification error), and I agree that having this discussion is important. But it does not mean that the summary plots are categorically invalid or uninformative, only that readers should be made aware of exactly what they are looking at. Only providing results for individual images has its own obvious downsides, namely being harder to digest by not being concise. I will post results for individual images later (or provide them via email for anyone who's interested).\n\n> Why don't you show images with somewhat lower bitrates (and more images in general)? I find that it is very hard to see any differences at all in the images you show in the paper.\n\nWe were focusing on quantitative analyses and realized too late that we need to bring down the bit rates much more to get into the regime of highly visible artefacts (which arguably is not that relevant from a production point of view, but certainly nicer to show in a paper). That said, the images do look visibly different, as confirmed by our MOS test. Note that the differences may be more or less visible depending on the PDF viewer and screen you use. I did not include more images in the paper because the PDF was already approaching 20 MB, but I am happy to provide a full set of compressed images on request.\n\nThanks for your feedback!"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression.

I assume that you trained a set of transforms for each method, and then generated the curves in the same way you did before for your method. When you trained the models, you certainly substituted our method of relaxing the distortion term. But did you also use our method of approximating the rate (i.e., additive uniform noise *without* quantization; piecewise linear densities)? If you substitute only the distortion term, you're not comparing to our method, but to some hybrid method, which might be worse than both of our proposals.\n\nWe also didn't mention that the optimization method is somewhat different (mostly due to your \"incremental\" scheme). What if our method just requires slower training, etc.? In general, due to all these differences, it seems to me it's too early to call out a \"winner\", and I'm not quite following your claim that your method is better. (I do think both papers have some unique aspects to contribute to the field and would be happy if the reviewers decide to accept both of them.)\n\nWith respect to the rate-distortion plots: We found that averaging over identical rates versus identical distortions can distort the appearance of the RD-plot in a way that it overemphasizes or underemphasizes high bit rates vs. low bit rates (see appendix of our paper). Thus, even if you take care that you generate the plot in exactly the same way for all methods, it might mislead you to think that some method is particularly well suited for the high- or low-bitrate regime, etc. Have you taken that into account? Also, note that starting with the very first version of our paper, we documented the way we generated the plot in the appendix, but some other references haven't done that. So there's a chance people can come to the wrong conclusion comparing plots across papers. We decided to enable a comparison based on individual images and stay away from averaged plots for now, until there is an agreed-upon solution.\n\nFinally, regarding that last point: Why don't you show images with somewhat lower bitrates (and more images in general)? I find that it is very hard to see any differences at all in the images you show in the paper.\n\nBest,\nJohannes.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression.

I am sorry if I didn\u2019t make this clear, it didn\u2019t occur to me that there was an alternative way of doing it.\n\nRegarding differences between your implementation and ours: Note that I mentioned two of the three differences you described. I didn\u2019t go into the neural network architecture, since I was mainly concerned with differences affecting qualitative performance, and you state in your paper that similar compression can be achieved using an architecture similar to ours, albeit less efficiently [1]. In preliminary experiments we found 5-10% reduction in bit rate using very simple context-free adaptive entropy encoding, so I assumed your use of CABAC would play a bigger role than the updated version of your paper shows.\n\nWhere I am not sure about your implementation is whether you compute a separate encoder/decoder pair for each lambda. If that is the case, a further difference would be the number of transformations used.\n\nRegarding summary plots, I agree that it\u2019s easy to get these wrong, although I am less pessimistic about their value if the same averaging is applied to all methods. If all curves are averaged at the same rate and also plotted against rate, the curves are easy to interpret as each point along the curve simply corresponds to the average distortion at that rate. To be able to measure distortion at arbitrary rates, we interpolated the curves for each image first. Interpolating and averaging has its own intricacies, which can be taken care of by measuring the actual rate-distortion at enough points for each method (we used 20 points for JPEG and JPEG 2000).\n\n[1] \u201cPreliminary results indicate that qualitatively similar results are achievable with other activation functions we tested, but that rectified linear units generally require a substantially larger number of model parameters to achieve the same rate\u2013distortion performance as the GDN/IGDN nonlinearities\u201d"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression.

Note that none of us are reviewers, official or unofficial, for this paper.  In our view, both papers offer interesting contributions, and we think the ICLR meeting would benefit from having both presented!\n\n[Theis, 23dec]: Ball\u00e9 et al. submitted closely related work to ICLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg). The main difference lies in their treatment of quantization. Together with adaptive entropy encoding, they achieve clear gains over JPEG 2000. We find that when everything else is the same, our treatment of quantization works better (https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7260857). Together, these results show that it is possible to significantly outperform JPEG 2000 using our approach.\n\nOur implementation differs in a number of ways from that of the current paper: we use a 3-stage generalized divisive normalization transform to map the image data into a space suitable for (uniform) quantization, an objective function based on continuous relaxation of the quantizer to an additive additive noise process, and an adaptive entropy coder.  This coder is adaptive to the statistics of individual images, but only weakly spatially adaptive within images (unlike JPEG 2000, which uses a much more sophisticated form of spatially adaptive coder).  In response to one of the reviews of our paper, we computed the entropy of the encoded test images from the Kodak set, assuming the probability model learned from the training set. As we expected, these entropies, which should closely approximate the performance of a *non-adaptive* entropy coder, are only slightly worse (on average) than the bit rates obtained with our adaptive entropy coder (see http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~balle/kodak-entropy2-psnr.pdf).  We conclude that most of the rate-distortion performance of our system arises from the 3-stage GDN transform.\n\nDespite this, we want to caution against over-interpreting averaged/summary rate-distortion results, and emphasize that compression results are best evaluated on individual images.  In our case, the average JPEG2000 R-D curve was computed over images encoded at the same *rate*, whereas the average R-D curves for our coder were computed over images encoded at the same *lambda* (R-D slope).  Although this makes no difference for results computed on individual images, it does affect the summary plot.  To illustrate this, we re-computed the average performance of JPEG2000 over images encoded at the same *distortion* level (the implementation allows specification of either distortion or the rate), and found that it gave a different curve, albeit still significantly worse than that of our coder (this plot is included in the appendix of the revised paper).  This discrepancy serves to illustrate the difficulty of providing a \u201ccorrect\u201d method of summarizing coder performance.  We suggest looking at the results for individual images (for our coder, these were made available at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/iclr2017).\n\n[Theis, 25dec]: I would appreciate it if the reviewer could take another look at Balle et al.'s paper, as their approach is in fact exactly to replace quantization with additive noise (Equation 5, $\\delta y$ is i.i.d. uniform noise). Thus, our plot is a comparison of Balle's approach (uniform noise) and the CAE.\n\nIn our paper, the substitution of additive uniform noise in place of quantization is done *only* for optimization (i.e., to create a continuously differentiable objective function).  All compression results (the rate-distortion curves and decoded images, both in the paper and online) are computed using actual quantization, followed by entropy coding.  This was explicitly stated in the paper, but might easily have been missed (we\u2019ve emphasized it more in the revision).  It appears that the rate-distortion plot linked in the response paragraph above, and also the images presented in figure 1 of this paper, may have been computed using additive uniform noise, and if so, are not a correct characterization of our coding method.  In the end, what matters is rate-distortion performance given actual quantization, not the rate-distortion performance under the proxy objective."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression.

Balle's approach isn't just \"quantization = uniform noise\", it is a combination of that and their density approximation.\n\nYou are right in that their objective isn't better optimized for adaptive encoding per-se, but it may be better optimized for entropy encoding in general---i.e., their approximation of rate (combination of approximations for quantization and density) may lead to better codes than the one in this paper. I'd argue that that is likely, since in fact Balle et al. report a 20% improvement in bit-rate over JPEG-2000 (it's possible, but unlikely, that _all_ of that is from using a variable coder).\n\nAgain, since Balle's work is a concurrent submission, this paper doesn't need to outperform it. But it should at least outperform the 16 year old hand-crafted shallow JPEG-2000 standard. When I wrote my initial review, I didn't notice that you weren't using an adaptive coder (like both JPEG200 and Balle's work do). It seems to me that that should be a simple experiment to run (perhaps use CABAC like Balle et al did).

As I understand, Balle's work doesn't just differ from this work in the treatment of quantization, but also in the way  the distribution (and therefore the entropy) is computed. This work uses uni-variate GMM's to approximate the probability distribution of coefficients, while Balle's work uses a finely-quantized piecewise linear approximation for p(x). Therefore, the actual objective that their paper optimizes is different from this one (although both are trying to approximate the same rate-distortion loss).\n\nI'm not sure what the plots in the figure in the previous message corresponds to. Is the \"uniform noise\" plot essentially the same method as CAE, but with the explicit forward-pass quantization replaced by the addition of uniform noise ? If so, that still would be different from what Balle's work is doing.\n\nI guess most of this speculation can be laid to rest if authors simply use the same regime as Balle's, i.e., apply a variable entropy coder post-hoc, and show that they get noticeably better results than JPEG-2000. (Beating Balle's work isn't necessary, since it's a concurrent submission).\n\n- The 'generative' comparison was a separate suggestion in my original review for a comparison if the paper is *not* able to show a clear benefit over JPEG2000. I realize that something that is not 'discriminatively trained' with respect to rate-distortion would give worse results. But that is the point---showing that at least the proposed approach offers an advantage over a naive generative model (as opposed to an expertly hand-crafted one like JPEG-2000). \n\nHere is the argument again: the paper, as it stands now, doesn't provide a system for natural image compression that would be preferable to use over the traditional standard (JPEG2000). If it is able to show better performance, then that's that. But if it's not, the paper can still claim a contribution in that the proposed compression method was automatically learned from data while JPEG2000 is hand-crafted, and can therefore be used in arbitrary domains. But to make this claim, it should be able to at least do better than other simple \"generative\" models (doing better than Balle's work, which is a concurrent submission, and also an end-to-end compression strategy is not necessary).\n\nAgain, if the authors feel they can do better than JPEG-2000 using a variable coder, they should go for it."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders", "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression.

We would be grateful if you could reconsider your score after taking into account the following points addressing some of your concerns:\n\n1. While the encoder is non-linear, we will include estimates of the filters of a linear approximation to the encoder so that they can be compared with JPEG 2000. (Preliminary noisy estimates of some of the filters: https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7260815\u00a0\u2013\u00a0note that the estimates are noisy, not the filters themselves).\n\n3. In a sense we are giving JPEG 2000 an unfair advantage, since its representations are encoded using adaptive entropy coding, and CAE\u2019s are encoded using range coding with simple i.i.d. assumption. Additional gains can be achieved by adding adaptive entropy coding, but unfortunately no easy-to-use implementation exists (we are working on it).\n\nBall\u00e9 et al. submitted closely related work to ICLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxdQ3jeg). The main difference lies in their treatment of quantization. Together with adaptive entropy encoding, they achieve clear gains over JPEG 2000. We find that when everything else is the same, our treatment of quantization works better (https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7260857). Together, these results show that it is possible to significantly outperform JPEG 2000 using our approach.\n\nWe will add this comparison to the paper. Since Ball\u00e9\u2019s approach is equivalent to a particular VAE, this should also qualify as a comparison to a well-crafted generative model.

While the idea is certainly interesting and well-motivated, in practice, it turns out to achieve effectively identical rates to JPEG-2000.\n\nNow, as the authors argue, there is some value to the fact that this scheme was learned automatically rather than by expert design---which means it has benefits beyond the compression of natural images (e.g., it could be used to automatically learning a compression scheme for signals for which we don't have as much domain knowledge). However, I still believe that this makes the paper unsuitable for publication in its current form because of the following reasons---\n\n1. Firstly, the fact that the learned encoder is competitive---and not clearly better---than JPEG 2000 means that the focus of the paper should more be about the aspects in which the encoder is similar to, and the aspects in which it differs, from JPEG 2000. Is it learning similar filters or completely different ones ? For what kinds of textures does it do better and for what kinds does it do worse (the paper could show the best and worst 10 patches at different bit-rates) ?\n\n2. Secondly, I think it's crucial that the paper demonstrate that the benefits come from a better coding scheme (as opposed to just a better decoder), as suggested in my initial pre-review question. How would a decoder trained on JPEG-2000 codes (and perhaps also on encoded random projections) do worse or better ?\n\n3. Finally, I think the fact that it does as well/worse than JPEG-2000 significantly diminishes the case for using a 'deep' auto-encoder. JPEG-2000 essentially uses a wavelet transform, which is a basis that past studies have shown could be recovered using a simple sparse dictionary algorithm like K-SVD.

Some details can be found at the bottom of page 6.\n\nFigure 3A shows the results of this training. Each blue dot corresponds to the (logarithm of a) scale parameter of a coefficient. The row of blue dots near zero was trained for the same rate-distortion trade-off that the rest of the parameters were trained for. The log-scales are therefore log(1) = 0, since no correction is necessary.

I don\u2019t have a clear answer to this question, but the intuition behind incremental training stems from the different coefficients having very different variances, which causes problems for gradient descent not fully addressed by Adam. There are probably other ways to deal with this problem (e.g., Newton-like methods or variance normalization similar to batch normalization).\n\nYes, the training becomes more stable due to the decrease in learning rate. Using the smaller learning rate from the start makes the performance worse (we will add another curve to the figure).\n\n3. We used 6 scales (we will add this detail to the paper).

We claim that we are able to \u201ctrain deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000\u201d (abstract), and that \u201cwe achieve performance similar to or better than JPEG 2000 when evaluated for perceptual quality\u201d (introduction). We also point out that \u201cin terms of PSNR, our method performs [\u2026] slightly worse at low and medium bit rates\u201d (Section 3.3). Secondly, note that the ultimate test for image compression has to be perceptual quality, and PSNR and SSIM should only be viewed as an approximation to it. In terms of perceptual quality as measured by a MOS test, we found a statistically significant albeit small improvement over JPEG 2000. That said, further improvements could easily be gained by using adaptive entropy encoding (as done by JPEG 2000) instead of simple range coding as we do now.\n\nRegarding your second point, we agree that it would be interesting to evaluate the effect of artefact removal on the rate-distortion curve and we will try to include such a comparison in a later version of our manuscript. However, note that the achievement described in this paper is not a new state-of-the-art encoding scheme (better algorithms than JPEG 2000 exist), but a simple solution to the unsolved problem of learning a useful encoder at all. This is a non-trivial contribution in itself, since it is not clear how to best deal with the non-differentiability in compression. It enables the use of deep learning where before a lot of expertise in signal processing was necessary to come up with a new encoder.\n\nWe will add encoding and decoding times to the paper. However, fair comparisons of any two algorithms are tricky, since the running time depends so heavily on the implementation. Some things to consider are that highly optimized and specialized (but not necessarily widely used) implementations of JPEG 2000 exist, while we used a general purpose framework designed for training but not for deployment.\n\nFinally, while our main contribution is conceptual, we are confident that our work will lead to state-of-the-art compression algorithms. We are currently exploring architectures and training better tuned for the low bit rate regime as well as introducing more sophisticated entropy encoding schemes (as used by other compression algorithms such as JPEG 2000).
