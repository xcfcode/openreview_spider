We rewrote Section 4.1 to make it clearer, ran several additional experiments to address your concerns, and updated the paper accordingly. We have made significant effort to address all of your feedback and we believe that the paper is much stronger as a result, so we hope you will consider increasing your score.\n\n**Clarity and more details on the optimization process:\nWe rewrote Section 4.1 to provide more details about the CNC model, as well as a clearer explanation of Algorithm 1. We also clarified that the CNC model F_{\\theta} is implemented using a neural network, where the parameter \\theta denotes the network weights (y_i = F_{\\theta}(v_i)). CNC is trained to optimize the objective presented in Equation 7 via backpropagation. \n\n**Choosing the embedding dimension d:\nWe updated Section 5.7 to clarify that dimension d is the dimension of the last layer of the Siamese network and specified the d values used for each of the datasets. Our novelty arises from the clustering phase in Algorithm 1 (steps 4-8). To allow for a fair comparison with SpectralNet (the prior state of the art method) and to evaluate the effectiveness of our clustering method, we used the same Siamese network architecture as SpectralNet on datasets on which they reported results.\n\n**Contribution of the embedding:\nWe performed an ablation study to evaluate the impact of embeddings by omitting the embedding step in Algorithm 1. While our results confirm that embeddings contribute to better performance, CNC still achieves significant gains over SpectralNet  (Shaham et al., 2018)  when both are evaluated without embeddings. These results have been added to Section 5.3.\n         MNIST: The ACC (Accuracy), and NMI (Normalized Mutual information) are 0.945 and 0.873, while with the embedding, ACC and NMI increase to 0.972 and 0.924. Even without the embedding, our method outperforms SpectralNet (ACC is 0.8, and NMI is 0.814) reported in (Shaham et al., 2018).\n        Reuters: The ACC and NMI are 0.684 and 0.428, but with the embedding, ACC and NMI increase to 0.824 and 0.583. Even without the embedding, our results outperform those of SpectralNet (ACC is 0.605, and NMI is 0.401) reported in (Shaham et al., 2018).\n\n**Parameter sensitivity:\nWe thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We ran new experiments to measure the sensitivity of CNC to different hyper-parameters, leading to some interesting observations. \nWe added analysis of these results, and a figure for visualization (Figure 4 in Section 5.7). To evaluate the sensitivity of the model to different hyper-parameters, we train the CNC model on the Reuters dataset by fixing some hyper-parameters and varying others. We noticed that CNC benefits from tuning the number of hidden layers (hl), learning rate (lr), batch size (b), and the number of nearest neighbors (k), but is not particularly sensitive to any of the other hyper-parameters, including decay rate, patience parameter (cadence of epochs where decay is applied), Gumbel-Softmax temperature or minimum temperature. \nMore precisely, we varied decay rate over the range [0.1-1.0], patience from [5-25] epochs, Gumbel-Softmax temperature from [1.0-2.0], and minimum temperature from [0.5-1.0]. Here are the results when we fixed the learning rate (lr), batch size (b), and number of nearest neighbors (k):\n++ hl=3, lr=5e-5, b=64, and k=3 : the average accuracy is 0.803 with standard deviation 2e-3.  \n++ hl=3, lr=5e-4, b=128, and k=3, the average accuracy is 0.821 with standard deviation 4e-3.\n++ hl=3, lr=5e-4, b=512, and k=10, the average accuracy is 0.811 with standard deviation 2e-3. \n++ hl=2, lr=1e-4, b=256, and k=3, the average accuracy is 0.766 with standard deviation 9e-4.\n++ hl=4, lr=1e-5, b=512, and k=3, the average accuracy is 0.766 with standard deviation 7e-3.\nAs you can see, the accuracy varied from 0.766 to 0.821, a difference of only 0.05.\n\n**Regarding missing NMI for some baselines in Table 1:\nOnly recent clustering methods have reported NMI, and before that, accuracy (ACC) was the only metric for comparison. For thoroughness, we have reported both NMI and ACC for our method and included NMI for all methods that reported it. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1076/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1076/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generalized Clustering by Learning to Optimize Expected Normalized Cuts", "authors": ["Azade Nazi", "Will Hang", "Anna Goldie", "Sujith Ravi", "Azalia Mirhoseini"], "authorids": ["azade@google.com", "agoldie@google.com", "sravi@google.com", "azalia@google.com", "willhang@stanford.edu"], "keywords": ["Clustering", "Normalized cuts", "Generalizability"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a novel end-to-end approach for learning to cluster in the absence of labeled examples.

In clustering, the affinity graph is built implicitly over the data points, whereas in graph partitioning, an explicit graph is given by the adjacency matrix. Previous benchmarks (MNIST, Reuters, and CIFAR) required generalization to unseen data points (nodes), whereas with these new benchmarks, we explore whether the CNC model is able to generalize to unseen graphs. We believe this is a more challenging task, because the model must learn to capture the graph structure, rather than merely learning to represent individual nodes. Based on new experiments that we ran, the CNC model demonstrates promising results on generalizable graph partitioning. In order to better capture the graph structure, we had to improve our embedding step by using graph embeddings, such as GraphSage and GCN (our best results were with GraphSage). For further details, please see the full experimental results in the Appendix. By evaluating deep clustering methods against these more challenging benchmarks, as suggested by the reviewer, we hope to push the field of deep clustering forward and investigate avenues for additional impact. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1076/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1076/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Generalized Clustering by Learning to Optimize Expected Normalized Cuts", "authors": ["Azade Nazi", "Will Hang", "Anna Goldie", "Sujith Ravi", "Azalia Mirhoseini"], "authorids": ["azade@google.com", "agoldie@google.com", "sravi@google.com", "azalia@google.com", "willhang@stanford.edu"], "keywords": ["Clustering", "Normalized cuts", "Generalizability"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a novel end-to-end approach for learning to cluster in the absence of labeled examples.

The authors experiment with a number of clustering datasets where the number of cluster is known beforehand (and where, for evaluation purposes, the ground truth is known), and find that their method generally improves over the clustering performance of SpectralNet (Shaham et al., 2018) in terms of accuracy and normalized mutual information, and that it finds solutions with lower normalized cut values.\n\nThe method proposed in this paper is very simple and appears to work well, and so this paper represents an important contribution.

It is rather the quotient of two expectations. In general, it might be better to just present the objective as a relaxation of the normalized cut objective.\n\nA question regarding the results and parameterization: was using Gumbel-Softmax necessary to get good results?

Our clustering objective is based on optimizing normalized cuts, a criterion which measures both intra-cluster similarity as well as inter-cluster dissimilarity. We define a differentiable loss function equivalent to the expected normalized cuts. Unlike much of the work in unsupervised deep learning, our trained model directly outputs final cluster assignments, rather than embeddings that need further processing to be usable. Our approach generalizes to unseen datasets across a wide variety of domains, including text, and image. Specifically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on popular unsupervised clustering benchmarks (e.g., MNIST, Reuters, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100), outperforming the strongest baselines by up to 10.9%. Our generalization results are superior (by up to 21.9%) to the recent top-performing clustering approach with the ability to generalize.", "pdf": "/pdf/1e742261bdc1e2f57bdca799882d60dd30a1fbf7.pdf", "paperhash": "nazi|generalized_clustering_by_learning_to_optimize_expected_normalized_cuts", "original_pdf": "/attachment/10e35c01058dafdca2a2e44b98738d13556e99dd.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nnazi2020generalized,\ntitle={Generalized Clustering by Learning to Optimize Expected Normalized Cuts},\nauthor={Azade Nazi and Will Hang and Anna Goldie and Sujith Ravi and Azalia Mirhoseini},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BklLVAEKvH}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
