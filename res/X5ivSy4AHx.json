The algorithm achieves the same complexity as the original SREDA scheme.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is perhaps the following aspects:\n-- C1: Improving the initial complexity for finding a starting point y0 of the SREDA.\n-- C2: Proposing a larger stepsize for SREDA compared to the original one.\n-- C3: Injecting a zero-order approximation step for stochastic gradients.\nThe authors also claimed that their analysis is new and different from SREDA. However, in my opinion, this seems to be minor since their proof also relies on the bounds of gradient errors (like variance) as well as the delta_t quantity. There are of course some technical details and steps, but those are not the major contribution.\n\nIn my opinion, the theoretical contribution of this paper is incremental. Indeed, the idea of using SARAH to improve oracle complexity has been widely studied in the literature, including Spider, SpiderBoost, ProxSARAH, etc. Since model (1) is nonconvex-strongly concave, it can be reformulated into (2) as a stochastic optimization problem. Several methods can be used to solve (2). The idea of using multiple loops is also widely used. \n\nThe first contribution (C1) is not really new. The authors simply replace the step of computing y0 by iSARAH to reduce the computational cost. Because the problem is strongly convex, this step can be done by several methods, including accelerated variance-reduced schemes to further improve its complexity. Since this step is not essential, many previous methods just simply skip it.\n\nThe second contribution (C2) is also minor since the idea of using a large batch-size to obtain large step-size has been used in the literature such as Spider-Boost (Wang et al 2019) or ProxSarah (Pham et al 2020). Of course, this enhancement helps SREDA have better practical performance. However, given the previous work, this contribution is very incremental.\nThe use of zero-order oracle (C3) is not new as well, since it is another way of approximating the gradients, and it has been widely used in the literature based on Nesterov's idea. Hence, this step seems to be unnecessary if we assume that the underlying function is L-smooth. In most applications, we can directly compute the stochastic gradient components without using finite difference approximation. Unless the authors can provide compelling examples showing that this is an important step, otherwise, it is not really convinced. \n\nIn terms of algorithm, SREDA/SREDA-Boost is also a multiple-loop algorithm, with at least three loops, making it challenging to implement in practice and it requires a lot of proper tuning and choosing parameters. There are some recent algorithms that can solve the same problems but with a single loop. The authors may want to compare with them, though these are very recent work (see, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08170 and the references therein).\n\nIn addition to the above major comments, the following are some concrete comments:\n--- In Table 1, why NA is put in the \"Initial Complexity\" column of other methods. I believe that some paper may not describe this clearly, but if they use the exact solution (or up to a given accuracy approximation) of the strongly-concave max-problem, then the complexity is the best one since we can use the best algorithm to find it.\n-- The relation between the gradient of $\\Phi$ and the KKT point of (1) should be clarified. \n-- I do not see where v_t is used in Algorithm 2. It seems that the output of Algorithm 2 should include v_t to use in Algorithm 1.\n-- It is not clear what is the problem solved in the numerical experiments?\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2235/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2235/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Enhanced First and Zeroth Order Variance Reduced Algorithms for Min-Max Optimization", "authorids": ["~Tengyu_Xu1", "~Zhe_Wang4", "~Yingbin_Liang1", "~H._Vincent_Poor1"], "authors": ["Tengyu Xu", "Zhe Wang", "Yingbin Liang", "H.

This paper develops a novel analytical framework that guarantees the SREDA's optimal complexity performance for a much enhanced algorithm SREDA-Boost, which has less restrictive initialization requirement and an accuracy-independent (and much bigger) stepsize.

The first contribution of the paper is to relax the conditions on the initialization  of SEDRA and moreover enable larger stepsizes ($\\epsilon$-independent stepsizes). As SEDRA is already optimal, such modification does not improve the theoretical convergence rate, but it is beneficial from the practical perspective. The second contribution is to adapt the method to zero order oracle, achieving the state-of-the-art convergence rate. \n\nThe result are presented in a clear and technical manner. My major concern is the lack of high level explanation on why a larger stepsize can be applied. I understand that the paper introduces a novel way for the complexity analysis, however the proof is very long and not easy to check. Hence, it would be helpful to explain in words the key aspects that allows an $\\epsilon$-independent stepsize (in a non-technical manner).  \n\nAnother question I would like to ask is whether the Boost version is necessary to deduce the zeroth order variant. In other words, what would be the complexity of ZO-SREDA. I would expect that it shares the same complexity as  ZO-SREDA-BOOST, even though the stepsize are smaller. Please clarify this point.\n\nThe experiments are rather limited but it is fine for a theoretical paper.  I would expect including more comparisons on competitive methods in Figure 1, as in the current version the only baseline is ZO-SREDA.
