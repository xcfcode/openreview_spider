All reviewers agree that the motivation and the idea of the paper are reasonable (although somewhat incremental) and make an interesting extension of mixup-type data augmentation. However, one expert reviewer raised some concerns which are unfortunately not fully resolved despite the intensive interaction. \n\nThe first one is the issue of diversity claimed in the paper. The authors explanation is mostly qualitative, and I, as an AC, also felt a logical jumping here, although I do understand that the proposed method somehow results in better generalization ability w.r.t. the number of generated samples as shown in Fig.3 in the appendix. This point is important because if the better generalization is coming from the label modification rather than the diversity in image space, then the novelty of the paper is limited.\nAnother concern is that there are some inconsistencies in the scores of previous methods implemented by the authors and in the original papers. We understand that the exact score is not always easy to reproduce, but at least it is desirable to follow the original setting (such as the number of epochs) for each method as far as possible, because the accuracy should be the most important criterion as the goal of data augmentation is better generalization. Then, authors may separately discuss computational efficiency. \n\nBased on the discussion with reviewers as above, I conclude that the paper should be further polished and completed before publication. Thus I recommend rejection for this time."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Saliency Grafting: Innocuous Attribution-Guided Mixup with Calibrated Label Mixing", "authorids": ["~Joonhyung_Park1", "~June_Yong_Yang1", "~Jinwoo_Shin1", "~Sung_Ju_Hwang1", "~Eunho_Yang1"], "authors": ["Joonhyung Park", "June Yong Yang", "Jinwoo Shin", "Sung Ju Hwang", "Eunho Yang"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Data augmentation", "Input attribution"], "abstract": "The Mixup scheme of mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample has gained much attention recently for better training of neural networks.

Cutmix is a image-specific variant of mixup that pastes a rectangular region from a donor image to a target image; however, it does this in a completely random fashion not paying attention to whether the discriminative parts of either image are retained. Recent methods alleviate this problem by using saliency guided region selection either preserving the most discriminative parts of the donor image (Attentive Cutmix) or both images (PuzzleMix). However, in doing so they replace the random nature of Cutmix with a deterministic approach potentially reducing sample diversity. The first contribution of the paper is a saliency guide stochastic augmentation method which combines the best of both worlds. The second contribution is in the generation of more meaningful labels for the newly created image by taking into account the saliency of the regions used from both images rather than blindly using the mixing ratio. The contributions of the paper are somewhat incremental but are reasonable. The validity of using saliency in determining the label of the new sample is clear. The experimental results are mixed. Most experiments demonstrate minor improvements over previous methods. On the other hand the top-5 performance of CutMix is better than the proposed method in Table 2. With such small differences and no standard deviations on accuracy reported it is not clear whether the improvements are really significant. \n\nIn the data scarcity experiments, I find the statement \u201c Note that the performance of CutMix deteriorates as the number of data per class decreases due to their randomness occurring\nlabel mismatching.\u201d misleading. This is true of every method in that table not just CutMix, and the detoriation amounts are very similar. \n\nClarity: Overall I found the paper well written and easy to read. \n\nThe authors have provided standard errors which improves the confidence that the improvements in the experiments are significant.

Thanks for the constructive comments. We have responded to each of your three comments.\n\n### [Q: I agree that PuzzleMix always contains the region ...... considered as a way to generate the diversity.]\n\nIt is true that $\\lambda$ determines how much salient region should be included, generating diversity. However, the amount of diversity generated thus is **not enough**, as randomly sampling the $\\lambda$ only results in expansions/contractions of the region with the maximum saliency patch inside. \n- The risk of selecting the highest saliency is well evaluated in our top-k removal experiment (Table A and B).\n- Please also check our new experimental result in Appendix A Figure 3 and our response above where we produce $k$ independent augmented instances with different samples of $\\lambda$. Here, the performance of Saliency Grafting consistently improves as k increases, whereas PuzzleMix is predisposed to maintain somewhat constant performance even when k increases. \n\nTo summarize, sampling $\\lambda$ does grant some diversity to PuzzleMix, but such diversity is **relatively small**, especially in the sense of **diversity of sample difficulty**, as PuzzleMix can only generate **easy** samples (maximum saliency region always included), while Saliency Grafting can generate samples of **diverse difficulties** (as in excluding maximum saliency region), resulting in superior generalization performance.  \n\n---  \n\n\n### [Q: Also, when I look at the visualization in Appendix D, I wonder if your method would generate noisy inputs (when comparing to PuzzleMix). \u2026\u2026 Similar issues can be seen at the bottom row for the Shark features.]\n\nWe are not sure about these \u201cnoises\u201d the reviewer addresses. We think that it might refer to:  \n\n1. non-object regions (background regions) being pasted on top of object regions\n2. object regions being pasted on top of non-object regions\n3. object regions being pasted on top of object regions \n4. grafting (occlusion) patterns that look \u201cnoisy\u201d to humans (e.g. checkerboard-like pattern).  \n\nFor *case 1*, these kinds of samples are beneficial to the generalization of the model since there exist many cases where the target object is occluded by an obstacle(e.g. only the rear end of a car is shown as the front is blocked by a building). The benefits of such samples are evident in Cutout [1] and Random Erasing [2]. Also, unlike other random augmentation, grafting only the background region is hard to occur in our method that exploits a temperature-scaled saliency map.\nFor *case 2*, when an object region is grafted on top of a non-object region, 2 objects exist in a single sample. These kinds of samples are frequently generated in PuzzleMix and benefit model training.\nFor *case 3*, when an object region is grafted on top of an object region, the image becomes a harmful sample(in a certain sense, noisy) as the overwriting image may cause label mismatch/miscalibration. However, we **rectify** this noise by using our calibrated label mixing.\nFor *case 4*, keep in mind that we are discussing a data augmentation scheme. These cases are not detrimental to training, but beneficial. The reviewer suggested that the bird-dog and shark-rabbit images are \u201cnoisy\u201d. Yet, by looking at the images, we humans can *still distinguish* all objects(bird/dog/shark/rabbit). Thus, this \u201cnoise\u201d makes the sample a hard one, but not a wrong one (especially with calibrated label mixing). By feeding these hard samples to the model, the model is prepared to classify such test-phase images with difficult real-life occlusion patterns. In this sense, we believe that providing samples of a variety of difficulties is beneficial to the generalization performance of the model.\n\n[1] Terrance DeVries and Graham W Taylor.

Reproducing results of Puzzlemix on Cifar-100]\nAs we have reported in the response for Q4 of the initial author response, the low performance of PuzzleMix is due to PuzzleMix requiring an **abnormal** amount of epochs.\nThe reported Cifar-100 results of the PuzzleMix paper are run for 1200 epochs (which is peculiarly long). Instead, our experiment (using the author code) results are reported for 300 epochs, which is a more **conventional experiment setting in data augmentation papers** (especially for light models such as ResNet-18) [1,2]. However, one might argue that the performance of PuzzleMix can only be observed when used in specific, paper-reported settings. To this end, we compare the methods inside **PuzzleMix\u2019s comfort zone**.  We also conducted other experiments (WRN28-10 on CIFAR-100, ResNet-18 on TinyImageNet) according to the experimental settings of the original PuzzleMix paper and confirmed that Saliency Grafting achieves the best performance even in these cases.  \n\n[1] Zhong et al., 2020. https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896v2  \n[2] Yun et al., 2019. https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04899  \n\n---\n\n### [Q. I wonder if you have the results on the ResNet-50 since PuzzleMix seems work well on large networks.]\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned in the above comment, we could not conduct the Cifar-100 on ResNet-50 experiment due to time constraints.

It might be the last experiment we can show in this rebuttal period, but we did our best to address the reviewer's concern. \n\n### [Q: Since your method adjusts the modeling target to match the saliency of the mixed image, \u2026\u2026 then the contribution created by the diversity is arguable.]\n\nTo clarify the reviewer's concerns, we conduct an additional Top-k removal experiment on Saliency Grafting ***without*** calibrated label mixing. This direct comparison (Saliency Grafting w\\o label mixing vs PuzzleMix) enables us to identify the difference in terms of sample diversity between the two methods. Saliency Grafting w/o label mixing shows some degree of degradation compared to Saliency Grafting with label mixing, but it still exhibits **superior performance** compared to PuzzleMix (Table A, B). On the other hand, PuzzleMix displays massive performance degradations.\nThe stark contrast between Saliency Grafting w/o label mixing and PuzzleMix proves that stochastic sampling with thresholding alone displays sample diversity that greatly surpasses PuzzleMix. However, we believe that our calibrated label mixing and stochastic sampling are **not entirely orthogonal**, as calibrated label mixing is essential to tackle potential harms that may arise from sample diversity.\nMoreover, as confirmed in our additional experiments (Appendix A Figure 3), if randomly sampled $\\lambda$ is indeed a factor that can effectively impose the sample diversity, then in our experiment of generating data $k$ times in a minibatch (see our reply above - \u201cAnother intriguing evidence regarding\u201d), the performance should rise as more the augmented data are generated (k-times) from the mini-batch. However, PuzzleMix did not show such tendencies.\n\nTableA. Top-1 error rates on TinyImageNet\u2019s test set with top-k% of salient regions removed (ResNet-18)\n\n| Method | Top-1 Err.

It would be fine if you don't have them.]\nUnfortunately, we do not have the results of Cifar-100 on ResNet-50. Due to the remaining time of the discussion phase, we could not conduct this experiment. However, we did report an experiment using ResNet-50, which is on ImageNet (Table 3). In this experiment, PuzzleMix works well(in fact, the numbers are taken from the PuzzleMix paper). Regardless, **Saliency Grafting outperformed PuzzleMix and all other methods**. Moreover, we reported an experiment on an even more complex architecture, PyramidNet-200. It is worth noting that PyramidNet-200 **(26.8M)** network is a larger network than ResNet-50 (23.5M). In the PyramidNet-200 experiment (Table 2), **our method outperformed** PuzzleMix and all other methods. With these experiments, we confirmed that our method exhibits the best performance not only with the ResNet-based architectures but also with other large architectures."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Saliency Grafting: Innocuous Attribution-Guided Mixup with Calibrated Label Mixing", "authorids": ["~Joonhyung_Park1", "~June_Yong_Yang1", "~Jinwoo_Shin1", "~Sung_Ju_Hwang1", "~Eunho_Yang1"], "authors": ["Joonhyung Park", "June Yong Yang", "Jinwoo Shin", "Sung Ju Hwang", "Eunho Yang"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Data augmentation", "Input attribution"], "abstract": "The Mixup scheme of mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample has gained much attention recently for better training of neural networks.

First, using a separate model pre-trained with neither PuzzleMix nor SaliencyGrafting, we produce saliency maps of the images in the test set. Using these saliency maps, we remove the top-k% (k = 12.5, 25) salient regions of each image. Using this modified test set, we evaluate the performance of two models trained with SaliencyGrafting and PuzzleMix, respectively. This experiment exhibits intriguing results (Table [A, B]), particularly in the case where the top-25% of salient regions are removed. Saliency Grafting is relatively superior at defending against performance degradations as k increases, while PuzzleMix\u2019s error rates increase significantly. In this sense, the following insights can be obtained:\nSince the model trained with PuzzleMix is used to being provided the most salient region of an object, its classification greatly depends on this region being present. Thus, when this region is **removed** or occluded, the performance drastically decreases. However, Saliency Grafting does not have this problem, since it is possible for the thresholding & stochastic sampling step to remove these most salient regions, forcing the model to correctly classify using other parts of the image. Regional dropout methods such as CutMix and Cutout also generate such regional diversity to increase generalization performance. Therefore, even though a set of PuzzleMix/AttentiveCutMix images generated through random sampling of mixing ratios from a fixed image pair are not identical to each other, it is insufficient to argue that these methods such as PuzzleMix, Attentive CutMix can guarantee effective diversity of augmented samples. This lack of diversity issue inflicts a negative effect on the generalization performance as shown in Table [A, B]. It might be easy to explain by using the above examples -The methods based on the maximum saliency strategy will struggle to classify a panda/dog with its head occluded, which is the most salient component of the image.\n\n---\n### [Q2. Discuss the difference with the paper - Nonlinear mixup: Out-of-manifold data augmentation for text classification (AAAI2020)]\n\nThank you for the helpful suggestion. We find that the Nonlinear mixup paper catches similar motivation to us. This paper focused on expanding the input space of augmented samples through the nonlinear interpolation policy. Moreover, this study proposes a novel scheme that adaptively determines the mixing coefficient of the encoded labels through the multiplication of learnable parameters $\\theta$ and vectorized word embeddings of nonlinear samples.  Albeit it is an interesting work in that it alleviates the limitations of the existing linear mixup, there are the following differences from our method:  \n1. Since the spatial structure is an inherent attribution of the image, it is difficult to learn target labels with a single fully connected layer using both concatenated embeddings and learnable parameters. Saliency maps are more effective in terms of capturing spatial features in natural images or spectrograms.  \n2. We propose the saliency-based label mapping function exploiting a saliency map without the learnable parameters or encoded label sets.  \n3. We also focus on the innocuity of the synthetic data not to generate the samples that possibly mislead the network. Thresholding on a temperature-scaled saliency map could effectively alleviate this issue.  \n\nThis comparison of the augmentation methodologies dealing with different domains will be beneficial to improve the quality of our paper. We've cited this interesting paper in our related work section (Section 2). We will also update this discussion in the preliminaries section (Section 3) in the final revision paper.

How sensitive is the threshold value to the performance of the proposed model?]\nThe threshold value of our method is determined by the expectation of the temperature - scaled saliency map (see Section 4). Note that the number of saliency regions greater than the expectation depends on the temperature $T$. As $T$ decreases, the softmax distribution becomes sharper and the number of saliency regions above the expectation decreases. That is, the mixing regions are selected from a smaller range. On the other hand, as $T$ increases, the distribution flattens so that nearly half the numbers are above the threshold. To see the sensitivity of model performance with respect to the softmax temperature, we conducted an additional experiment on the CIFAR-100 dataset with ResNet-18 by increasing the temperature from 0.01 to 0.30 (Appendix A  Figure 4). If we set a very small $T$, such as 0.01, only a small number of regions are mixed, resulting in a relatively small performance improvement. As we raise the temperature, the number of participating regions increases, resulting in a major increase in performance. When the temperature is sufficiently high, enough number of regions can participate in the mix. Thus, further increasing the temperature plateaus the performance.\n\n---\n### [Q4. Why does PuzzleMix exhibit degraded performance in Table 2 of the main paper? (CIFAR100 w/ PyramidNet-200 experiment) ]\nPlease note that our experiment on CIFAR-100 with PyramidNet-200 in Table 2 just follows the setting of CutMix paper. This setting that trains the network for 300 epochs while decaying the learning rate at 150, 225 epochs, is widely employed in data augmentation papers [1]. The experiment for PuzzleMix was conducted using the author\u2019s code. Also, we adopted the 4 hyperparameters (label smoothness $\\beta$ , data smoothness $\\gamma$, prior term $\\eta$, transport cost $\\xi$) as described in the PuzzleMix paper. Despite the alignments made, PuzzleMix exhibited degraded performance. However, such a phenomenon is again observed in an additional experiment (Q6), where PuzzleMix lags behind simpler augmentation methods such as CutMix and Mixup. \n\nWe conjecture that the degraded performance of PuzzleMix on CIFAR-100 with PyramidNet-200 partly originates from the epoch difference (In the Puzzlemix paper, the authors trained the model for 1200 epochs for ResNet18 on CIFAR-100, which is generally a very long experiment.). Nevertheless in this experiment, running more epochs only for PuzzleMix is unfair since all other methods also tend to continuously improve as the number epochs increases. In addition, since the qualitative wall-clock training time per epoch of PuzzleMix is almost 4 times that of simple random augmentation (CutMix, Mixup) and reaches up to 2.5 times of that of Saliency Grafting, it is difficult to train a parameter-heavy model such as PyramidNet-200 with a method that requires total 16x wall clock time (4x per epoch and 4x epochs). The significant computation cost of PuzzleMix is due to the increased number of backward passes and the additional optimization problems for each iteration. \n\nSince PuzzleMix was not able to reach the expected performance, we conducted an additional experiment on PuzzleMix\u2019s terms. In our original submission, we included a WRN28-10 experiment following the PuzzleMix paper setting. By adopting the exact setting described in the PuzzleMix paper, we can directly compare the performance of our method with the sufficiently converged, **author-reported performance of PuzzleMix (Table 10)**. In this experiment, Saliency Grafting exhibits superior performance compared to the reported performance of PuzzleMix.\nOur attempt to reproduce the author-reported values using the author codes resulted in Top-1 16.18 (+- 0.148) and Top-5 3.78 (+- 0.032). If we compare Saliency Grafting with the reproduced values, the Top-1 error gap is widened (our method is still the best).\n\nAlso, as suggested by the reviewer, additional experiments were conducted on another dataset, and another architecture, which is described in the next questions Q5 and Q6.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896v2"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Saliency Grafting: Innocuous Attribution-Guided Mixup with Calibrated Label Mixing", "authorids": ["~Joonhyung_Park1", "~June_Yong_Yang1", "~Jinwoo_Shin1", "~Sung_Ju_Hwang1", "~Eunho_Yang1"], "authors": ["Joonhyung Park", "June Yong Yang", "Jinwoo Shin", "Sung Ju Hwang", "Eunho Yang"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Data augmentation", "Input attribution"], "abstract": "The Mixup scheme of mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample has gained much attention recently for better training of neural networks.

Evidence of why PuzzleMix lacks diversity and how it negatively impacts the model\u2019s performance]\nWe believe that the diversity only from the randomness of mixing ratio $\\lambda$ for PuzzleMix would not suffice and does not change much the fact that PuzzleMix is designed to always contain the regions with the highest saliency scores. Example images visualizing this point is shown in Figure 6 in Appendix D. In the first row of Figure 6, we are trying to mix an image of a panda image with an image of a dog using PuzzleMix. This maximum saliency strategy results in always containing the region of highest saliency, regardless of \\lambda\u2018s value. That is, the head of the panda or the head of the dog are **always** contained in the sample created by PuzzleMix, regardless of $\\lambda$. This lack of diversity (bias) results in the model overly relying on these specific regions to perform classification (overfitting). However, Saliency Grafting does not have this bias due to thresholding & stochastic sampling. The 2nd row of Figure 6 shows the samples created by Saliency Grafting. We can observe that there exist samples that the head of the panda or the dog is occluded (more diversity). \nQ3 on the threshold for normalized map below, in fact, can be a quick evidence that the diversity beyond the randomness of lambda helps to improve performance. If this threshold is given large and hence only the most salient part is selected deterministically, our method is also reduced to a mixup method that simply maximizes the saliency, as in previous studies, and experiences the performance degradation (See Q3 for more details below). Please also note that we also discussed the risk of deterministic patch selection in the ablation study (Section 5.3).

It just shows that grafting salient corrupted image patches improves over just training on corrupted patches, which is something to expect given the previously reported improvements.]\nWe conducted additional experiments to measure the performance of various methods without AugMix. In this setting, results show that all methods exhibit lackluster performance, including Saliency Grafting. In this sense, we agree with R1 that our method cannot guarantee significant robustness on its own. However, the intention behind our statement is that our method can be used on top of AugMix with no repercussions while generating positive synergy. Augmix, on its own, provides noise robustness but shows lackluster performance when it comes to boosting performance on clean data. When Saliency Grafting is used alongside Augmix, both clean data performance and corrupted data performance is increased beyond the numbers obtained by applying them individually (synergy). We will properly update our statements in the revision.\n\n---\n\n### [Q2: Ablation study for employing uniform thresholding of the salient region rather than selecting the maximum, to mitigate selection bias.]\nPlease see Section 5.3 (Ablation Study) in our original submission where we presented the comparison of deterministic selection VS stochastic selection. In this section, we take AttentiveCutMix, which employs a deterministic strategy of selecting top-k pixels from a saliency map. While keeping everything else identical, we change this deterministic selection strategy of AttentiveCutMix to our stochastic selection strategy(thresholding + stochastic sampling). To keep the number of selected pixels approximately equal, we calibrated the softmax temperature so that ***k*** pixels are selected on average. Results in Table 6 show that **Stochastic+area labels** (2nd entry) show better performance compared to **Deterministic+area labels** (1st entry).\n\n---\n\n### [Q3: Curious to know if any other method of threshold selection (or patch sampling) has been explored?]\nWe considered that it was better to select the threshold value using data statistics rather than thresholding by a fixed constant, so we adopted the expectation(mean). It is possible to adjust the number of saliency regions with a value larger than the expectation through temperature. It also is possible to control the number of saliency regions with higher values than the expectation by adjusting the shape of the softmax distribution through temperature $T$. Moreover, we plan to conduct an experiment that tweaks the $\\alpha$ of the beta distribution, which is the current patch sampling distribution, to evaluate the performance difference by making the beta distribution shape concave or convex.

With such small differences and no standard deviations on accuracy reported it is not clear whether the improvements are really significant.]\n\nThank you for your feedback. We report the standard errors of CIFAR-100 for PyramidNet-200 (Table 2 in the main paper) in Table A (below). Also, in addition to the experiments in the main paper, we conducted 2 additional experiments to benchmark Saliency Grafting: TinyImageNet for ResNet-18 (Table B) and CIFAR100 for ResNet-18 (Table C), and also report standard errors for both of them. In these experiments, Saliency Grafting *consistently* outperforms other methods. This performance gap is a major gain for a data augmentation method, as the gain is achieved not by changing architectural designs, which are the main powerhouse of performance, but by tweaking data processing schemes, which are small but effective finishing touches. We also observe that for all of these experiments, the standard errors are far from overlapping, conveying statistical significance.\nIn the main paper, we omitted standard errors to align our experiments with previous papers, as they have not reported any standard errors. However, we agree with R3 that standard errors are necessary. Since the results reported in previous papers do not contain standard errors, we reproduced them using author codes and guidelines for repetition. However, for some methods, we were unable to reproduce the performance stated in their respective papers, albeit using the author\u2019s code/hyperparameters and following their guidelines.\n\nTable A.

Indeed, the performances of all methods degrade as the number of data per class decreases. However, the meaning we tried to convey was that CutMix suffers the most from data scarcity. In Table 4 of the main paper, we reported results (top-1 error on CIFAR-100) for 3 data portions: 10%, 20%, and 50%. When data scarcity is not severe (50%), CutMix (28.73) performs slightly better than Mixup (28.97) and is relatively close to PuzzleMix (28.04). However, as the amount of data decreases, the performance of CutMix degrades rapidly, displaying the worst performance (lags behind all augmentation methods) among the augmentation methods as we hit 20% and 10% data (On 10% data, the top-1 error of CutMix is 55.71 while Mixup is 51.86 and PuzzleMix is 52.63). We will clarify the statement in the revision.\n\nWe suspect that this is because CutMix carries an innate flaw that is **label mismatch**, due to the saliency-agnostic nature of its scheme. A previous study shows that label noise is more destructive when data is scarce (Rolnick et al. 2017 [1]). We suspect that this is why CutMix performs worse in data scarcity situations.\nPuzzleMix and Mixup incompletely address this problem by generating incorrectly calibrated labels. However, our method produces well-calibrated (correct) labels which are shown to be more resistant to data scarcity, with our method displaying the best performance.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Saliency Grafting: Innocuous Attribution-Guided Mixup with Calibrated Label Mixing", "authorids": ["~Joonhyung_Park1", "~June_Yong_Yang1", "~Jinwoo_Shin1", "~Sung_Ju_Hwang1", "~Eunho_Yang1"], "authors": ["Joonhyung Park", "June Yong Yang", "Jinwoo Shin", "Sung Ju Hwang", "Eunho Yang"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Data augmentation", "Input attribution"], "abstract": "The Mixup scheme of mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample has gained much attention recently for better training of neural networks.

To attain this goal, the proposed approach incorporates a random process in the saliency regions selection process to give all salient regions equal chance, and accordingly adjust the modeling target to match the saliency of the mixed image. The paper presents an interesting extension to the existing work. Nevertheless, I would like to see more evidence of why the existing methods lack of diversity and how it negatively impacts the model\u2019s performance. I also think the experiments in the current form is weak. My major comments are as follows. \n\nRegarding the proposed method:\n\n1.\tThe motivation of generating diverse mixed images through selecting diverse salient features is interesting to me. But I think the current justification is weak. It is true that the Puzzle Mix will select saliency regions with high intensity, but I wonder if the random mixing ratio \\lambda in PuzzleMix would help to generate diverse mixed samples due to the random sampling process. Another factor for the diversity here is that even using similar saliency regions of the input pair for the mixed images, the mixed labels are different due to the random selection of the mixing ratio. In this sense, I think how severe this lack of diversity issue is and how it negatively impacts  the performance of the mode are not very clear to me.  It would be very beneficial if the paper could show it somehow. \n2.\tThe way that the proposed method generates the mixed modeling target for the mixed input reminds me of this paper: nonlinear mixup: out-of-manifold data augmentation for text classification (AAAI2020). In the nonlinear Mixup method, the mixed label for a mixed input in Mixup is also computed based on the input pair, although the method is evaluated using text classification tasks. I think it would be useful to discuss the difference and adjust the content such as Table1 and Section3 to make the statements in the paper more accurate. \n\n3.\tSome parts in the proposed method deserve further discussion and justification. For example, the Threshold for the normalized saliency map. How sensitive is the threshold value to the performance of the proposed model? It would be useful to include some analysis either theoretically or experimentally. \n\nRegarding the experiments:\n\n1.\tI am surprised to see from Table2 that the PuzzleMix degraded the performance of the baseline model. I wonder why this happened. In this sense, I would like to see experiments with some other benchmarking datasets such as Cifar10, SVHN, or TinyImagenet. Also, for these experiments, it would be useful to also provide the deviation of the 3 runs. \n\n2.\tFor Cifar100 using WRN28-10 (also for ImageNet with ResNet-50), the difference between the proposed method and the PuzzleMix is very small. This suggests that it would useful to experiment on other network architectures such as ResNet-18 or ResNet-50, which are used in the original Mixup and the PuzzleMix papers. \n\nMinor issues:\n\n1.\tThe paper discusses the harmful samples potentially generated by Mixup in several places without citation. I think it would be useful to include some citations such as the manifold intrusion issue raised in the AdaMixup paper (AAAI2019) or the noise image issue as discussed in the PuzzleMix paper (ICML2020).\n\n In short, I think the paper would benefit from further justifying the problem of lack of mixed sample diversity in the PuzzleMix. Also, the current experimental results show minor improvement over PuzzleMix, which also makes the contribution of the paper less significant. \n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3330/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Saliency Grafting: Innocuous Attribution-Guided Mixup with Calibrated Label Mixing", "authorids": ["~Joonhyung_Park1", "~June_Yong_Yang1", "~Jinwoo_Shin1", "~Sung_Ju_Hwang1", "~Eunho_Yang1"], "authors": ["Joonhyung Park", "June Yong Yang", "Jinwoo Shin", "Sung Ju Hwang", "Eunho Yang"], "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Data augmentation", "Input attribution"], "abstract": "The Mixup scheme of mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample has gained much attention recently for better training of neural networks.

Clear and effective method. State-of-the art results with thorough ablation study.", "review": "The authors propose a novel sailency-guided data augmentation method that alleviates some of the drawbacks arising with recent Mixup-based augmentation approaches.  Specifically, the authors propose sailency thresholding for region selection (instead of maximum sailent region), stochastic sampling of sailent patches, and sailency-based label mixing. The results show clear improvements over competitors, and an ablation study shows the performance gains of each of the design choices discussed previously.\n\nThe paper is pleasant to read and all decissions are properly motivated. The main contributions are fairly novel, the formulation sound and the experiments well designed. \n\nThe claim of robustness of data corruption of the model seems like an over-statement. Even though the authors show that Sailency Grafting performs well under data corruption, one may attribute the robustness feature to the AugMix method that the grafting acts upon. The results of table 5. just show that grafting sailent corrupted image patches improves over just training on corrupted patches, which is something to expect given the previously reported improvements.  \n\nEarly in the paper the authors claim a difference wrt. previous work that is the uniform thresholding of the salient region rather than selecting the maximum, to mitigate selection bias. I missed a section in the ablation study demonstrating the specific improvement of this decision. Also the authors briefly mention the approach to select the thresholding as the mean of the normalized sailency map. I'm curious to know if any other method of threshold selection (or patch sampling) has been explored.

A straightforward and widely used extension is to combine Mixup and regional dropout methods: removing random patches from a sample and replacing it with the features from another sample. Albeit their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods are prone to create harmful samples due to their randomness. In recent studies, attempts to prevent such a phenomenon by selecting only the most informative features are gradually emerging. However, this maximum saliency strategy acts against their fundamental duty of sample diversification as they always deterministically select regions with maximum saliency, injecting bias into the augmented data. To address this problem, we present Saliency Grafting, a novel Mixup-like data augmentation method that captures the best of both ways. By stochastically sampling the features and \u2018grafting\u2019 them onto another sample, our method effectively generates diverse yet meaningful samples. The second ingredient of Saliency Grafting is to produce the label of the grafted sample by mixing the labels in a saliency-calibrated fashion, which rectifies supervision misguidance introduced by the random sampling procedure. Our experiments under CIFAR and ImageNet datasets show that our scheme outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation strategies not only in terms of classification accuracy, but is also superior in coping under stress conditions such as data corruption and data scarcity.
