In particular, the use of LSTMs helps take into account interdependencies between pattern labels. \n\nStrengths:\n- The paper is very well written. Contextualization with respect to previous work is adequate. Explanations are clear. Novelties are clearly identified by the authors.\n- Quantitative improvement with respect to the state the art. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper does not introduce strong technical novelties -- mostly, it seems to apply previous techniques to the medical domain. It could have been interesting to know if there are more insights / lessons learned in this process. This could be of interest for a broader audience. For instance, what are the implications of using higher-resolution images as input to DenseNet / decreasing the number of layers? How do the features learned at different layers compare to the ones of the original network trained for image classification? How do features of networks pre-trained on ImageNet, and then fine-tuned for the medical domain, compare to features learned from medical images from scratch? \n- The impact of the proposed approach on medical diagnostics is unclear. The authors could better discuss how the approach could be adopted in practice. Also, it could be interesting also to discuss how the results in Table 2 and 3 compare to human classification capabilities, and if that performance would be already enough for building a computer-aided diagnosis system.\n\nFinally -- is it expected that the ordering of the factorization in Eq. 3 does not count much (results in Table 3)?

Leveraging the label dependency has been ignored in previous work on medical diagnosis. We carefully designed such models to address it while taking into account application-specific constraints (e.g.  Section 1 (especially paragraph 2), Section 3.1, Section 3.3.1 and Section 5). In addition, clinical-relevant metrics are proposed, analyzed (see Section 4.2) and measured (see Section 4.4) as opposed to conventional machine learning metrics that are hard to interpret clinically by medical practitioners. We believe all of the above contributions are novel.\n\n\"It could have been interesting to know if there are more insights / lessons learned in this process. This could be of interest for a broader audience. For instance, what are the implications of using higher-resolution images as input to DenseNet / decreasing the number of layers? How do the features learned at different layers compare to the ones of the original network trained for image classification? How do features of networks pre-trained on ImageNet, and then fine-tuned for the medical domain, compare to features learned from medical images from scratch?\"\n\nThank you for the suggestions. The central idea is to exploit the label dependencies, for which we have focus on extensively. For other non-central design choices (such as architectural choice of DenseNets, the use of fine-tuning), the reasoning has been stated while leaving quantitative evaluation for the future study. Regarding your point of pre-trained models: Table 2 shows the diminishing benefits of using pretrained out-of-domain models once a large amount of in-domain training pairs are available, as the previous SOTA relies a pretrained model from ImageNet. For both pretraining and fine-tuning, lower resolution (224*224, as opposed to 512*512 in our work) and out-of-domain bias (from ImageNet, very much different from medical images) could possibly account for the difference. As you mentioned, fine-tuning might be a reasonable middle-ground. However, as has been recently observed, fine-tuning has its inherent issue of \u201ccatastrophic forgetting\u201d and needs to be dealt with care.\n\n\"The impact of the proposed approach on medical diagnostics is unclear. The authors could better discuss how the approach could be adopted in practice. Also, it could be interesting also to discuss how the results in Table 2 and 3 compare to human classification capabilities, and if that performance would be already enough for building a computer-aided diagnosis system.\"\n\nThe medical use case that motivated our research was the automated prediction of all (modeled) abnormalities that are present in a chest x-ray image. While the performance of the proposed model represented an improvement over the previous state of the art, the accuracy certainly falls short of human performance. In practice, however, the predictions are probably good enough to find utility in triage applications or as a second-read diagnostic aid. Measurement of the clinical impact, as well as a comparison to human performance, will have to wait for future studies designed to collect and analyze the required data in a standard randomized clinical trial. \n\n\"Finally -- is it expected that the ordering of the factorization in Eq. 3 does not count much (results in Table 3)? As a non-expert in the field, I'd expect that ordering between pathologic patterns matters more.\"\n\nJust to be clear, this is an empirical question. In theory, all orderings are equivalent but in practice they might differ because factors are parameterized by models. Based on our experiments, however, the ordering of the factorization does not significantly impact the results. This phenomenon has been consistently observed in other publications that use NADEs (e.g. Iterative Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator, NIPS 2014). In practice, one could average models trained with different orderings. Model averaging is not the central point of this work.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to diagnose from scratch by exploiting dependencies among labels", "abstract": "The field of medical diagnostics contains a wealth of challenges which closely resemble classical machine learning problems; practical constraints, however, complicate the translation of these endpoints naively into classical architectures.

Considering that their paper is titled as a work to use \"dependencies\" among labels, not being able to evaluate their network's, and lack of interpretable evaluation results on this model in the experiment section is a major limitation.\"\n\nThe reviewer is correct that estimating the marginal probability of a given abnormality using the proposed model would be computationally expensive. We do not consider this a major limitation because the motivation for our research was to model events (i.e. the abnormalities) that occur together. By definition, the marginal probability describes each event in isolation. Section 1 of the paper provides a few specific examples of abnormalities that domain experts know to be dependent. The proposed model attempts to capture such dependencies by describing the joint distribution abnormalities. The medical use case that we intended to support is for the model to predict all abnormalities that are present in the image and the joint probability quantifies the confidence of the prediction as a whole. That being said, other metrics such as sensitivities and specificities remain accessible (Section 4.2) for individual abnormalities.\n\n\"On the other hand, there are many alternative models where one could simply use multi-task learning and shared parameter, to predict multiple outcomes extremely efficiently. To be able to claim that this paper improved the prediction by better modeling of 'dependencies' among labels, I would need to see how the (much simpler) multi-task setting works as well.\"\n\nThe baseline model (model_{a}) described in our paper represents the standard multi-task learning approach in which the encoder parameters are shared across classes and decoder uses class-specific output layers.
