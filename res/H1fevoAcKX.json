Modification\n\n   1.1 We reorganized the content of this paper and added Motivation(section 2). In section 2, we added a comparative experiment of pruning strategies for the VGG-16 on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  The design of the comparative experiment is mainly to abstract the ideas of the previous paper (including Hard pruning, Soft pruning, Local pruning and Global pruning) and compare them in combination. We added a description of the different pruning strategies in section 1 (Introduction). At the same time, we compare the proposed saliency formulas one by one and conclude that the cumulative normalized saliency formula is effective. Comparison results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2(a).\n\n   1.2 Previously submitted paper did not provide a good illustration of the innovation of the algorithm. We rewrite section 1 and list the contributions of this paper one by one.\n\n   1.3 We modified section 3.2.1 to add a Taylor expansion derivation and reasonably explained the effect of gradient factors and weights factors on the loss function. This derived from \"Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference\", Molchanov, et al., 2017 and \"Accelerating convolutional networks via global & dynamic filter pruning.\"  Shaohui Lin, et al 2018\n\n2. Experimental Result\n\nThrough experiments, we can prove that global pruning is better than local pruning, soft pruning is better than hard pruning. Within my knowledge, GSFP is the first to combine global pruning strategy with soft pruning strategy. In addition to this, experiments prove that a reasonable and normalized saliency formula can improve the problem of extremely unbalanced pruning results(all the kernels of some layers are cut off) at high pruning rates. Finally, the accuracy of the pruning can be improved by accumulating the saliency score in the model recovery training process after pruning.\n\n3. Other\n\n** For ResNet-18 , GSFP reduced the FLOPs by 47.06% , with a Top-1 accuracy drop 2.95%. For ResNet-34, under almost the same loss of precision, the GSFP was reduced by 3.75% compared to the \"Soft filter pruning for accelerating deep convolutional neural networks\" He  et al. In addition, when the pruning was further increased, the calculation amount was reduced by 9.6%, while the Top1 precision loss was only decreased by 0.5%.  I think the method proposed in this paper is effective, but it is more obvious on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper234/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper234/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper234/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Globally Soft Filter Pruning For Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper propose a cumulative saliency based Globally Soft Filter Pruning (GSFP) scheme to prune redundant filters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).Specifically, the GSFP adopts a robust pruning method, which measures the global redundancy of the filter in the whole model by using the soft pruning strategy.

At the same time, I need some time to reproduce your idea of pruning.\n\nThere are two basic premise about our GBFP algorithm:\n1. We think fine adjustment of the compression ratio of each layer can bring better performance. So we are using the global pruning, not the idea of pruning layer by layer. https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0336.pdf\n2. Replace Hard Filter Pruning with Soft Filter Pruning. We do not limit the parameters after pruned can not re-participate in training.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06866\n\nLater, I will try randomly pruning based on these two points.\n\nThanks for your helpful comments!"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper234/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper234/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper234/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Globally Soft Filter Pruning For Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper propose a cumulative saliency based Globally Soft Filter Pruning (GSFP) scheme to prune redundant filters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).Specifically, the GSFP adopts a robust pruning method, which measures the global redundancy of the filter in the whole model by using the soft pruning strategy. In addition, in the model recovery process after pruning, we use the cumulative saliency strategy to improve the accuracy of pruning. GSFP has two advantages over previous works:(1) More accurate pruning guidance. For a pre-trained CNN model, the saliency of the filter varies with different input data. Therefore, accumulating the saliency of the filter over the entire data set can provide more accurate guidance for pruning.
