This is interesting from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.\n\nOriginality:\n* Our metric is the first to be interpretable in terms of graph reconstruction. A hierarchy is \"better\" than another in the sense of our metric if it allows to better recover the initial graph.\n\nSignificance:\n* We agree that higher-order relationships can be naturally be included to our metric (showing again its interest!), and we would mention that explicitly in the paper if it is accepted (thanks for the suggestion :-). However, we do think that the proposed metric, based on pairwise relations, is both relevant and easier to interpret.  \n\nIn short, the main advantage of our metric is that it is *interpretable*, which makes it easy to understand, to apply, and to enrich.\n\nThe authors", "title": "Quality, originality and significance"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Graph Representations by Dendrograms", "abstract": "Hierarchical  clustering is a common approach to analysing  the \nmulti-scale structure of  graphs observed in practice.  \nWe propose a novel  metric for assessing the quality of a hierarchical clustering.

Dasgupta recently suggested the first such metric with interesting properties. This has encouraged a number of recent works about designing algorithms that work well for the metric and other similar metrics. This paper suggests a new metric for evaluating hierarchical clustering of given graph data. \n\nHere are the main comments about the paper:\n- I am not convinced about the advantages of the new metric over the previously suggested metrics by Dasgupta and Cohen-Addad et al.\n    - Theoretical analysis shows properties of the new metric that are similar to that of Dasgupta (since the metric itself has similarities). However, the advantage of the new metric is not very clear. \n    - Experimental analysis just shows that the new metric is different from Dasgupta\u2019s but again there is no evidence to suggest why the new metric may be better. \n\n- In the abstract it is mentioned that \u201cThe best representation of the graph for this metric in turn yields a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm.\u201d I do not understand this. Which novel algorithm is being referred to? \n\n- Again, it is mentioned in the abstract that \u201cExperiments on both real and synthetic data illustrate the efficiency of the approach\u201d. What efficiency is being referred to here and what is the approach? What I see is that known clustering algorithms are used to compare the new metric with the previous one by Dasgupta.\n\nOverall, I think more work is needed in this paper. There are some non-trivial observations but unless the authors make the motivation for defining this new metric for evaluation more clear.\n\nOther comments:\n- Section 5: NP-hardness has not been shown and it is just mentioned that the authors believe that the problem is NP-hard just as the problem associated with the cost function of Dasgupta et al.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper46/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Graph Representations by Dendrograms", "abstract": "Hierarchical  clustering is a common approach to analysing  the \nmulti-scale structure of  graphs observed in practice.  \nWe propose a novel  metric for assessing the quality of a hierarchical clustering.
