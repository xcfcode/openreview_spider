The paper would be stronger if the analysis shows any theoretical advantage to the presented method. I think the author put a good effort in addressing some of my concerns and I m raising my score to 6. \n\n \n####\nSummary of the paper:\n\nThe paper proposes stein self repulsive dynamics for sampling from an unnormalized distribution. The method starts by using Langevin dynamic for up to time $Mc$ and then uses those pasts samples to guide the trajectories of the langevin sampling to explore new areas of the densities  using the stein witness function between the current particles  and the past samples( similar to Stein Variational gradient descent). \n\nThe paper analyses the mixing properties under standard assumptions of the potential of the Boltzmann distribution and the kernel used in the Stein discrepancy, and shows convergence to the boltzman distribution as the number of particles goes to infinity and the step size goes to zero. \n\nAuthors validate their methods and show that it indeed explores on a synthetic example new areas wrt to pure langevin dynamics. Applications in sampling from the posterior of bayesian neural networks and contextual bandits compare the performance of the proposed method to langevin dynamic and pure stein descent favorably. \n\nClarity/presentation :\n\nThe paper is well written and the intuition are well presented . \n\nThe notation $\\hat{delta}_{M} $ is not great in denoting direct measures, please using another symbol. \n\nMy main concerns with the paper are the following:\n\n- the definition of $\\bar{\\delta}_{M}$ averages only $M$ particles choosen for $M$ time stamps. Something is off here for the continuous approximation to work at each time stamp you need $N$ particles and then you have a past horizon $M$. As $M\\to \\infty$ this does not matter, but I think in your implementation you are considering at each time step $N$ particles and you average on a horizon of size $M$. is this correct? Please clarify?\n\n- The theorem show only asymptotic behavior and don't quantify the intuition behind the paper , that the \"coverage of the samples\" is higher.\n Can you for instance bound the wasserstein  distance between the pure langevin and Stein Repulsive dynamic , and between SVGD and your method, as it was done in \"The promises and pitfalls of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics\". Basically you can find a coupling between trajectories of your methods and the langevin dynamics and bound the wasserstein distance between the two methods. This will be insightful to see if one would mix faster with respect to the other one.  \n\nWhile the appendices of the paper are lengthy I don't think they explain the most selling point of the method, since they are asymptotic and there is a confusion between the time horizon for the past , and the number of particles.  if $M$ is  $\\infty$ in this defintion , we are just running langevin dynamic, and not using Stein witness function. I see an important issue in this definition of the time horizon, I think this time horizon should be finite, and that from time steps less we sample N particles , and we let this $N$ go to infinity.\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits from Past Samples", "authors": ["Mao Ye", "Tongzheng Ren", "Qiang Liu"], "authorids": ["lushleaf21@gmail.com", "rtz19970824@gmail.com", "lqiang@cs.utexas.edu"], "keywords": ["Approximate Inference", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Stein Variational Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified samples from intractable un-normalized distributions.

Below are our responses. (2/n)", "comment": "Q3: I would have been much more convinced by a set of well-chosen and controlled experiments. The 2-dimensional examples are far too low-dimensional to be convincing. Higher-dimensional Gaussian? Higher-dimensional mixtures? Non-linear tractable problems in higher dimensions? Influence of the tuning parameters (RBF parameter? alpha? step-size in SGLD)? Computational issues? Subsampling-effect?\n\nA3: We would like to point out that the main aim of the low dimensional toy example is to transparently visualize how the proposed repulsive force helps sampling in a more intuitive way. We believe it is an necessary and informative experiment. We also found several other papers also use this way to build the intuition, e.g. [1, 3, 5].\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we conduct additional Higher dimensional Gaussian experiment with d = 100 and Gaussian mixture experiment with dimension = 20 with different values of alpha. The result and description of the experiment is at Appendix A.2 and A.3.\n\nWe also believe that the experiment are well-controlled: In all of the 2D toy experiments, we use the update norm to rule out the influence of additional gradient. In all the experiment, we couple SRLD with LD by using the same initialization and same sequence of Gaussian noise in each repeat.\n\nRegarding the influence of tuning parameters, since it is not realistic to do ablation study on all the hyper-parameter (and many of them are not introduced by this paper), we simply fix many of them and tune the step size for each sampling method in the same way. We believe this is a standard experiment setting that is broadly used in the machine learning community, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] etc. The setting of other hyper-parameters is as follows (as we mentioned in the paper): \n \n    1.RBF parameter: As described in the paper, we use the median heuristics introduced in [3] to choose the bandwidth of RBF kernel, which is a generally used heuristics (and also a well accepted setting in the community) for kernel-based variational inference methods, for example, papers [5, 6, 7] also use this trick without more ablation study.\n    \n     2.Alpha: As mentioned in the paper, we simply fix this parameter without further tuning. We believe further tuning of this parameter can further improve the quality of the proposed method. We study the effect of alpha in the new additional experiment in A.2 and A.3 appendix.\n    \n    3.Number of mini-batch samples: We simply use the same number of mini-batch samples for each method in each experiment as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] etc. do. \n\nFor the computational issue, we just need additional O(M) time to calculate the repulsive gradient, which is not expensive, given the fact that current libraries are well optimized to do matrix multiplication/addition.\n\n[1] Chen, Tianqi, Emily Fox, and Carlos Guestrin. \u201cStochastic gradient hamiltonian monte carlo.\" International conference on machine learning. 2014.\n[2] Ding, Nan, et al. \"Bayesian sampling using stochastic gradient thermostats.\" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2014.\n[3] Liu, Qiang, and Dilin Wang. \"Stein variational gradient descent: A general purpose bayesian inference algorithm.\" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2016.\n[4] Rezende, Danilo, and Shakir Mohamed. \"Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2015.\n[5] Shi, Jiaxin, Sun, Shengyang and Zhu, Jun. \u201cKernel implicit variational inference\u201d, International Conference on Learning Representations. 2018.\n[6] Wang, Ziyu, et al. \"Function Space Particle Optimization for Bayesian Neural Networks.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019.\n[7] Chen, Changyou, et al. \u201cA Unified Particle-Optimization Framework for Scalable Bayesian Sampling\u201d Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence. 2018\n[8] Bubeck, S\u00e9bastien, and Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi. \"Regret analysis of stochastic and nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problems.\" Foundations and Trends\u00ae in Machine Learning 5.1 (2012): 1-122.\n[9] Riquelme, Carlos et al. \u201cDeep Bayesian Bandits Showdown: An Empirical Comparison of Bayesian Deep Networks for Thompson Sampling.\u201d International Conference on Learning \nRepresentations. 2018.\n[10] May, Benedict C., et al. \"Optimistic Bayesian sampling in contextual-bandit problems.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 13.Jun (2012): 2069-2106."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits from Past Samples", "authors": ["Mao Ye", "Tongzheng Ren", "Qiang Liu"], "authorids": ["lushleaf21@gmail.com", "rtz19970824@gmail.com", "lqiang@cs.utexas.edu"], "keywords": ["Approximate Inference", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Stein Variational Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified samples from intractable un-normalized distributions.

Below are our responses. (1/n)", "comment": "Thanks very much for your comments! To make things clear, we first briefly summarize our answer regarding your questions and then we elaborate the details.\n\nRegarding your Q1: we don\u2019t clearly get your question. In SRLD, we only maintain one single chain and thus at each time step we only have one sample. At time step K, we use samples at time $K-c_\\eta, K-2c_\\eta, \\cdots, K-Mc_\\eta$. If time step $K$ is less than $Mc_\\eta$, we run Langevin. Regarding the limit of $M$, we discuss it in the response to your Q3.\n\nRegarding your Q2: We agree with you that it is better to have refined analysis on comparing mixing time. In one of our intermediate result, we show that SRLD is geometric ergodic, which indicates that its mixing would be good. However, different from Langevin, our system is with higher order and nonlinear, refined analysis comparing the mixing time is extremely challenge and we want to postpone it as future work. Compared with many published work in this area, we believe our current contribution has reached the standard of publishing. We would also want to point out that the technique/bound in your suggested paper (thanks for suggesting this paper) is not able to compare which dynamic\u2019s mixing is faster.\n\nRegarding your Q3: As our system is nontrivial and complicate, there are some special requirements to take the limit. The way of taking limit proposed in your review comments is not appropriate. We give the correct way of taking limit below. The key idea is, in taking the limit of $M$, we also need to ensure the total number of iterations $K$ should be larger than $M$ to make SRLD not degenerate to LD. We also want to point out that, alternatively, we can obtain the M initial sample from some distribution rather than Langevin dynamics.

Below are our responses.", "comment": "Q1: In Theorem 4.3, the result holds for any $k$ and $M$. The authors claim that if we take a limit of $M \\to \\infty$ with fixed $k$, the practical dynamics converges to the discrete-time mean-field limit, in Section 4. However, to state the result of Theorem 4.3, $k$ should be bigger than $M c_\\eta$ from the dentition of $\\tilde{\\rho}_k^M$, as shown under the equation (4). How do we take a limit of $M \\to\\infty$ ? Does k also go $\\infty$?\n\nA1: Thanks for pointing this out. The result of this theorem holds uniformly for any $k$ (not a fixed $k$). Besides, we do not require $k$ bigger than $M c_\\eta$ in the definition of $\\tilde{\\rho}_k^M$. When $k$ is no more than $M c_\\eta$, $\\tilde{\\rho}_k^M$ and $\\rho_k^M$ are stochastic processes with same distribution and thus the Wasserstein distance between them is 0. And for any $k$ is greater than $M c_\\eta$, we have the uniform bound (w.r.t. $k$) as stated in the theorem 4.3. We are sorry for not stating this clearly in the theorem and we have revisited the present of the theorem. We will fix this issue in the next revision.\n\nWe also point out that, as our system is complicated, in taking the limit of $M\\to\\infty$, we need to ensure that the number of iteration we run is larger than $Mc_\\eta$. To be specific, the asymptotic convergence would be \n\n$$\\lim_{k,M \\to\\infty, \\eta \\to 0^+} \\mathbb{D}_{\\text{BL}} (\\rho_k, \\rho^*)=0$$\n\nwhere the joint limit of k and M requires that $k\\eta\\to\\infty$; $\\exp(C\\alpha^{2}k\\eta)\\eta^{2}=o(1)$; $(k\\eta)/(Mc)=q(1+o(1))$ with $q>1$. Here if $q \\leq 1$, we degenerate to Langevin. But when $q>1$ (intuitively that means, when $M$ is large, the number of iterations we run is larger), our dynamics is different from Langevin, which is what we do in the practice.\n\nAlso, we would like to remark that this seemingly strange things is in fact the \u2018artifact\u2019 caused by the using of Langevin dynamics at beginning to obtain the $M$ initial samples when we designed the practical implementation of the proposed methods. However, it is not really necessary to use Langevin dynamics to get $M$ initial samples, as we can simply using some other initialization distribution and get the $M$ initial samples from that distribution (and by this setting, our dynamics is simply the second phases in Eq (3)). All our theory can be easily generalized to this setting using almost identical argument, which can also address your concerns on this issue.\n \nQ2: Regarding other minor comments\nA2: Thanks for your notification!

Something is off here for the continuous approximation to work at each time stamp you need N particles and then you have a past horizon M. As  $M\\to\\infty$ this does not matter, but I think in your implementation you are considering at each time step N particles and you average on a horizon of size $M$. Is this correct? Please clarify? \n\nA1: We are not sure whether we interpret your question correctly, we prepare the following clarifications that we guess are related to your concern. If none of the following answers correctly address your question, please let us know and we will clarify further.\n\n- We don\u2019t use $N$ samples for each time step in our implementation. In practice, we only run one chain and thus at each time step we only have one sample. And at time step $K$, we calculate the repulsive gradient based on the past $M$ samples. Notice that here we add a thinning factor $c_\\eta$ and the past M samples would be the ones at time step $K-c_\\eta, K-2c_\\eta,\\cdots ,K-Mc_\\eta$. (If K is smaller than $Mc_\\eta$, in the implement we simply run Langevin). (If $K$ is larger than $Mc_\\eta$, we do not use the sample at time step less than $K-Mc_\\eta$). Regarding the issue on taking $M\\to\\infty$, please see our answer to your question 3.\n\n- The practical dynamics and discrete-time mean-field dynamics converge to each other when $M$ is sufficient large. And in the practical dynamics, we only use $M$ samples from past time steps (1 sample each time step). The key phenomenon is that the empirical distribution of the past M samples is able to approximate the mixture of marginal distributions at the past $M$ time step (which is $\\tilde{\\rho}_k^M$ in the main text). \n\n- In the continuous time limit, we consider how the dynamics evolves as $t$ continuously changes. Again, there is only one chain (which is just one realization on the stochastic process) and at each time step, we also only have one sample. Similar to the discrete time case, at time step $T$, given the thinning factor $c$, we calculate the repulsive gradient based on the past $M$ samples, which is the samples at time step $T-c, T-2c, \\cdots, T-Mc$.\n\nSince we are not sure about whether we understand your concern correctly, let us know if we do not address your concern."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits from Past Samples", "authors": ["Mao Ye", "Tongzheng Ren", "Qiang Liu"], "authorids": ["lushleaf21@gmail.com", "rtz19970824@gmail.com", "lqiang@cs.utexas.edu"], "keywords": ["Approximate Inference", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Stein Variational Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified samples from intractable un-normalized distributions.

Can you for instance bound the wasserstein distance between the pure langevin and Stein Repulsive dynamic , and between SVGD and your method, as it was done in \u201cThe promises and pitfalls of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics\". Basically you can find a coupling between trajectories of your methods and the langevin dynamics and bound the wasserstein distance between the two methods. This will be insightful to see if one would mix faster with respect to the other one.  \n\nA2: We agree with you that providing quantitative analysis on comparing mixing time would be a huge improvement. One of our intermediate result shows that the proposed SRLD is geometric ergodic (see B.2, appendix). In our assumptions, LD is also geometric ergodic. It is not clear whether SVGD is geometric ergodic (though we expect it is not and thus we may be better than SVGD). However, compared with Langevin dynamics, since our system is with higher order and nonlinear, a further refined comparison analysis on mixing time is very challenge and we believe it is out the scope of this paper and we would like to postpone it to future work.\n\nWe believe our current contribution has been above the bar of publishing in this area. There are quite a few published papers proposed new sampling methods without mixing time guarantee, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  Similar to us, they justify the proposed sampling method by showing convergence to the target distribution and support their improvement on sampling quality by some empirical evidence. Compared with many of them, we give more throughout theoretical analysis. \n\nWe also would like to point out that bounding the Wasserstein distance between SRLD and LD/SVGD using the suggested way is not able to compare whose mixing is faster as it can only show whether two dynamics converges to the same limit with some extra error term (and we\u2019ve justified that SRLD is able to approximate the target distribution).

Comparison with an ensemble of NN?\n\nA2:  It is hard to interpret the gain for sure, as the dimension is high. We conjecture the gains is from the better exploration of the posterior domain, which matches our intuition. The reasons are as follows:\n\n    1. Just as Figure 1, 4, 6 shows, our methods can better explore the under-explored region given the previous samples, so we expect similar behaviors in the higher dimensional setting.\n\n    2. In the contextual bandits experiment, our method is significantly better than Langevin. This is because in this problem, a better uncertainty estimation is the key for the performance as described in [8, 9, 10]. And we think the better performance in the contextual bandits experiment support our idea on better exploration of the posterior domain.\n\n    3. We also provide more detailed experiment on the Appendix (e.g. Figure 7, 8 and table 3, 4). With growing number of samples, the proposed SRLD decreases the test RMSE and increases the test LL faster than LD, which is due to the better exploration of posterior domain.\n\nRegarding the multimodality question, it\u2019s known that neural networks suffer from multimodality, e.g. in [6] the authors discussed the multimodality of neural network, but this is beyond the scope of our paper. \n\nRegarding the comparison with a single NN or an ensemble of NN, we think it\u2019s not very meaningful to compare the result with them. Because our purpose is to test the performance of different sampling methods but single or ensemble of neural networks are not designed for sampling the posterior of Bayesian Neural Networks.\n\nIn the end, we want to highlight that UCI examples have become a standard benchmark in this area as we mentioned in A1, and we believe it gives good quantification on sampling quality."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits from Past Samples", "authors": ["Mao Ye", "Tongzheng Ren", "Qiang Liu"], "authorids": ["lushleaf21@gmail.com", "rtz19970824@gmail.com", "lqiang@cs.utexas.edu"], "keywords": ["Approximate Inference", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Stein Variational Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified samples from intractable un-normalized distributions.

Below are our responses. (4/n)", "comment": "Q3: While the appendices of the paper are lengthy I don't think they explain the most selling point of the method, since they are asymptotic and there is a confusion between the time horizon for the past , and the number of particles.  if  M is \\infty in this defintion , we are just running langevin dynamic, and not using Stein witness function. I see an important issue in this definition of the time horizon, I think this time horizon should be finite, and that from time steps less we sample N particles , and we let this N go to infinity.\n\nA3: As we point out in addressing your last comments, the role of our theory is to justify the proposed sampling dynamics rather then comparing different dynamics. And different from most previous sampling dynamics, the proposed dynamics is nonlinear with higher order dependency on past stages, the analysis itself is challenging.\n\nRegarding the issue on $M$: Thank you for pointing out this issue! In the theory, we give non-asymptotic bound for all the approximations. Our system is actually very complicated and thus we need to be careful when taking the asymptotic limit to show the convergence. Your way of taking the limit is not appropriate. The correct way to take the limit is as follows: (we\u2019ve also added a new remark in the main text blow theorem 4.3.)\n\n$$\\lim_{k,M \\to\\infty, \\eta \\to 0^+} \\mathbb{D}_{\\text{BL}} (\\rho_k, \\rho^*)=0$$\n\nwhere the joint limit of $k$ and $M$ requires that $k\\eta\\to\\infty$; $\\exp(C\\alpha^{2}k\\eta)\\eta^{2}=o(1)$; $(k\\eta)/(Mc)=q(1+o(1))$ with $q>1$. Here if $q \\leq 1$, we degenerate to Langevin. But when $q>1$ (intuitively that means, when $M$ is large, the number of iterations we run is larger), our dynamics is different from Langevin, which is what we do in the practice. \n\nWe would also want to point out that this seemingly strange things is actually the \u2018artifact\u2019 caused by the using of Langevin dynamics to obtain $M$ initial samples: when $M \\to \\infty$, we need to run the Langevin for infinite long time. However, it is not really necessary to use Langevin dynamics to get $M$ initial samples ----- we can simply using some other initialization distribution and get the $M$ initial samples from that distribution (and by this setting, our dynamics is simply the second phases in Eq (3)). All our theory can be easily generalized to this setting using almost identical argument.\n\nIn practice, we find it is very natural to use Langevin to obtain the initial M samples and as a burn-in process. We use this way to do all the experiments. We use the current setting to do theoretically analysis because we want our theory to be as close to practical as possible.\n\nWe hope you can kindly raise your score if our answers address your concerns.

The idea of the proposed method is natural, which is incorporating the functionality of SVGD to reduce the auto-correlation of Langevin dynamics.

The authors claim that if we take a limit of M -> \u221e with fixed k, the practical dynamics converges to the discrete-time mean-field limit, in Section 4.

Does k also go \u221e?\n\nMinor comments:\n- The definition of g should depend on only \\theta_k^I and \\hat{\\delta}_k^M, not \\theta_k^k.\n- The equation (1) should hold for any \\theta\u2019, not \\theta.\n- The equation (1) should contain \\rho, not p."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper993/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits from Past Samples", "authors": ["Mao Ye", "Tongzheng Ren", "Qiang Liu"], "authorids": ["lushleaf21@gmail.com", "rtz19970824@gmail.com", "lqiang@cs.utexas.edu"], "keywords": ["Approximate Inference", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Stein Variational Gradient Descent"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified samples from intractable un-normalized distributions. ", "abstract": "We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversified samples from intractable un-normalized distributions. Our idea is to introduce Stein variational gradient as a repulsive force to push the samples of Langevin dynamics \naway from the past trajectories. This simple idea allows us to significantly decrease the auto-correlation in Langevin dynamics and hence increase the effective sample size. Importantly, as we establish in our theoretical analysis, the asymptotic stationary distribution remains correct even with the addition of the repulsive force, thanks to the special properties of the Stein variational gradient. We perform extensive empirical studies of our new algorithm, showing that our method yields much higher sample efficiency and better uncertainty estimation than vanilla Langevin dynamics.", "pdf": "/pdf/742602b0b30e91244ba7b7450465a68bc8dab21a.pdf", "code": "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xa6ihm45g181tmf/AAB6fysesxLJ0XfzRYHQlF3xa?dl=0", "paperhash": "ye|stein_selfrepulsive_dynamics_benefits_from_past_samples", "original_pdf": "/attachment/44c9882b94cdaa3b9738814acd946c2862a75909.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nye2020stein,\ntitle={Stein Self-Repulsive Dynamics: Benefits from Past Samples},\nauthor={Mao Ye and Tongzheng Ren and Qiang Liu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eWGREFvB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
