Maybe the authors can add more experiments for NLP to prove that the solution can be widely-adopted.\n- A1: Thanks for this suggestion. We are currently implementing our method with an NLP distillation framework [1]. The setting is as follows: \n\ndataset:  multinli (MNLI);\nteacher: BERT-base-cased, 12 layers, 768 Hidden, 108M params;\nstudent: T3, 3 layers, 768 Hidden, 44M params;\n\nBesides, we follow the training setting in [2].

We add the following experiments: 1) Gradually excluding regularization samples and 2) Gradually adding non-regularization samples while regularization samples are kept. For adding or excluding a sample, we set a probability to achieve this goal. For example, if during training, a sample is marked as a regularization sample according to the value of $a$ and $b$, we backward the loss of this sample by a probability $p$. In this way, we can gradually change the training settings. Specifically, the setting is teaching WRN-40-1 with WRN-40-2 and the results are as follows:\n\n|excluding all regularization|excluding 0.75 regularization|excluding 0.50 regularization|excluding 0.25 regularization|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|74.59|74.63|74.72|74.87|\n\nThe other results are\n\n|only on regularization|adding 0.25 non-regularization|adding 0.50 non-regularization|add 0.75 non-regularization|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|73.86|74.12|74.47|74.71|\n\nFor the above tables, the values after excluding or adding are the probabilities of excluding or adding this sample. The results further verify our motivation that we need to balance the weights between non-regularization and regularization during training. These results are updated in the appendix.\n\n---\n- Q2: Can the authors give some quantitative results in Table 5 experiments to show how weighted soft labels tune sample-wise bias-variance? \n- A2: Similar to Q1, we conduct experiments with weighted soft labels for the intermediate states.\n\n|excluding all regularization|excluding 0.75 regularization|excluding 0.50 regularization|excluding 0.25 regularization|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|75.35|75.48|75.61|75.72|\n\nand\n\n|only on regularization|adding 0.25 non-regularization|adding 0.50 non-regularization|add 0.75 non-regularization|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|74.46|74.79|75.18|75.53|\n\nCompared with the results presented in Q1, we can observe that weighted soft labels are indeed balancing the sample-wise, not on dataset scale, bias, and variance. The balancing is achieved by lower the weights of regularization samples during training, instead of dropping them.

The definition of variance is flawed. The formulation doesn't match with the figure illustration and code implementation.\n- A1: The variance shown in Fig 1 is to illustrate that the variance caused by __different teachers__ is similar to the variance caused by __different training datasets__. The figure is inspired by the book [1] and a blog post [2]. If we train a model, the chosen training dataset is a sampling from the ground-truth data distribution. Then different choices of training dataset introduce variance. Similarly, in our definition of variance, we think the selection of a teacher network introduces randomness. With different teacher networks, we will have different soft labels, so the final performance will be different. \nOur implementation is to investigate the sample-wise bias-variance caused by distillation. The corresponding implementation is like the practice of tuning the model complexity we use in machine learning. For example, given a training dataset, we need to decide to use a linear regression model or a quadric regression. Since increasing model complexity leads to a larger variance, the quadric regression has a larger variance than the linear regression. Note that in this process, we do not estimate the variance by using multiple training datasets. This is because the variance describes how much the model predictions will change if the training set changes. In our paper, bias and variance are also decomposed from the generalization error, and decrease one will increase another. __So in our implementation, we do not estimate the variance__, which is similar to choosing a linear regression model or a quadric regression for a machine learning task. __Overall, our code implementation matches our algorithm and problem formulation.__\n\nWe revised Figure 1 to avoid misleading presentations. The teachers in the figure are changed to soft label sets, which are more consistent with the variance illustrated in [1] and [2]. Finally, thanks for this helpful comment.\n\n[1] Friedman, Jerome, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. The elements of statistical learning. https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf (PDF Page 244 Figure 7.2)\n[2] https://blog.insightdatascience.com/bias-variance-tradeoff-explained-fa2bc28174c4 (the first figure)\n\n---\n- Q2: Second concern is that the mathematical reasons behind the not-too-big or not-too-small weights for these regularization examples are unclear.\n- A2: Our weighting scheme is based on a straightforward motivation: We need to adaptively handle the regularization samples and the weight should be in $[0,1]$. As mentioned in our paper, the weighting form is inspired by previous practice that verified useful (Lin et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2019). In fact, we have tried other straightforward weighting schemes. Since the weight should be a number between $[0,1]$ and $\\frac{L_{ce}^s}{L_{ce}^t}$ is the input, a baseline idea is that we can use sigmoid to do this. Note that $\\frac{L_{ce}^s}{L_{ce}^t}$ is always bigger than 0, so the weight needs scaling and can be defined as $\\frac{2}{1+\\exp(-\\frac{L_{ce}^s}{L_{ce}^t})}-1$. The comparison between the adopted weighting form and the Sigmoid baseline is (CIFAR 100, WRN-40-2 teach WRN-40-1)\n\n|$\\alpha$|2.0|3.0|4.0|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Sigmoid baseline|74.13|73.97|73.29|\n|Ours|74.38|74.12|73.46|\n\nWe can see that as long as we can adaptively tune the sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff, the performance is better than KD, i.e., without weighted soft labels. Therefore, although the proposed weighting form is not mathematically optimal, the not-too-big or not-too-small weights for these regularization examples are not hard to tune. These results verify our main contribution that there is a sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff and we need to assign weights to the regularization examples. The results and discussions are updated in the appendix.\n\n--- \n- Q3: The relation (similarity and difference) between your employed BVD from [Heskes 1998] and [Pedro Domingos 2002] is not discussed. [Giorgio Valentini 2004] is not even cited, which seems inappropriate. Also, comparing with the variance definition of [Zitong Yang, 2020], have you tried multiple loss functions and observe the same phenomenon?\n- A3: Thanks for the closely related work. Our employed BVD is directly from the results in [Heskes 1998]. We add new words in the paper to emphasize the relation and include [Giorgio Valentini 2004] as well. We did not try other loss functions, since the scope of this paper is to investigate knowledge distillation, which is defined by KL divergence. We agree that trying other loss functions is an important future direction of this paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper138/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper138/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Rethinking Soft Labels for Knowledge Distillation: A Bias\u2013Variance Tradeoff Perspective", "authorids": ["~Helong_Zhou1", "~Liangchen_Song1", "~Jiajie_Chen1", "~Ye_Zhou2", "~Guoli_Wang2", "~Junsong_Yuan2", "~Qian_Zhang7"], "authors": ["Helong Zhou", "Liangchen Song", "Jiajie Chen", "Ye Zhou", "Guoli Wang", "Junsong Yuan", "Qian Zhang"], "keywords": ["Knowledge distillation", "soft labels", "teacher-student model"], "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained network or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of a student network.

The author(s) have decomposed the expected student's training error into the bias, variance, and irreducible noise parts. This decomposition is further rewritten as two parts: one for bias reduction and another for variance reduction. The motivation is clearly explained and the experimental results show that this new approach can improve the model training performance of the student on both CIFAR100 and Imagenet. \n\npros:\n- A novel perspective of performing knowledge distillation.\n- The motivation is clear and the framework is straightforward to understand.\n- The code is provided, therefore, I believe the reproducibility is high.\n\ncons:\n- The definition of variance is flawed. The formulation doesn't match with the figure illustration and code implementation.\n- The observed phenomenon regarding the regularization examples is not well explained.\n- The experimental details are not sufficient.\n\nconcerns:\n- My major concern comes from the definition of variance and its corresponding implementation. From my understanding, the variance should be estimated from multiple teachers, just as shown in Fig 1, which matches my thoughts. But it seems like the author(s) are trying to fade this concept intentionally. First, the expectation's definition for Equation 1 is not clear. It should take the expectation over the space of infinite teachers, or at least empirically multiple teachers with a substantial number. Second, after checking on the code, I only find one teacher is utilized in the implementation. Would you please elaborate on why this is the design? \n\n- Second concern is that the mathematical reasons behind the not-too-big or not-too-small weights for these regularization examples are unclear. This reweight scheme is purely empirically, and it would be a much solid paper with mathematical interpretations. \n\n- The bias-variance decomposition on classification has been well studied in multiple papers, e.g., [Pedro Domingos 2002], and [Giorgio Valentini 2004]. The relation (similarity and difference) between your employed BVD from [Heskes 1998] and [Pedro Domingos 2002] is not discussed. The latter [Giorgio Valentini 2004] is not even cited, which seems inappropriate. Also, comparing with the variance definition of [Zitong Yang, 2020], have you tried multiple loss functions and observe the same phenomenon? \n\n- minor issue: the sample-wise error for one example x should be explicitly listed and the notation should be consistent through the whole paper, y(x), and y should not be mixed together. I know the original [Heskes 1998] paper did the same, but you should be consistent on this notation. \n\n- other minor things: Could you please elaborate a bit more of how you preprocess the imagenet data into 1.2 million images and how many classes are remained? This piece of information seems missing and the code doesn't reveal much about it.

How many $\\alpha$s have been tested? What are the results? The main concern is that the grid search is costly in practice.  Therefore, I appreciate the analysis in this paper that helps us understanding KD better. However, the grid searched hyper-parameters makes Sec. 4 costly in practice.\n\nBased on the quality of the paper, I select 6 as the initial score.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper138/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper138/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Rethinking Soft Labels for Knowledge Distillation: A Bias\u2013Variance Tradeoff Perspective", "authorids": ["~Helong_Zhou1", "~Liangchen_Song1", "~Jiajie_Chen1", "~Ye_Zhou2", "~Guoli_Wang2", "~Junsong_Yuan2", "~Qian_Zhang7"], "authors": ["Helong Zhou", "Liangchen Song", "Jiajie Chen", "Ye Zhou", "Guoli Wang", "Junsong Yuan", "Qian Zhang"], "keywords": ["Knowledge distillation", "soft labels", "teacher-student model"], "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective approach to leverage a well-trained network or an ensemble of them, named as the teacher, to guide the training of a student network.  The outputs from the teacher network are used as soft labels for supervising the training of a new network.  Recent studies (M \u0308uller et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2020) revealed an intriguing property of the soft labels that making labels soft serves as a good regularization to the student network.   From the perspective of statistical learning,  regularization aims to reduce the variance,  however how bias and variance change is not clear for training with soft labels.   In this paper, we investigate the bias-variance tradeoff brought by distillation with soft labels.   Specifically,  we observe that during training the bias-variance tradeoff varies sample-wisely. Further, under the same distillation temperature setting, we observe that the distillation performance is negatively associated with the number of some specific samples, which are named as regularization samples since these samples lead to bias increasing and variance decreasing.  Nevertheless, we empirically find that completely filtering out regularization samples also deteriorates distillation performance.  Our discoveries inspired us to propose the novel weighted soft labels to help the network adaptively handle the sample-wise bias-variance tradeoff.  Experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method.
