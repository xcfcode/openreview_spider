Based on a systolic array hardware architecture the authors model the energy consumption of transferring the weights and activations into different levels of memory (DRAM, Cache, register file) during inference. The energy consumption is therefore determined by the number of nonzero elements in the weight and activation tensors. To minimize the network loss under an energy constraint, the authors develop a training framework including a novel greedy algorithm to compute the projection of the weight tensors to the energy constraint.\n\nPros:\n\nThe proposed method allows to accurately impose an energy constraint (in terms of the proposed model), in contrast to previous methods, and also yields a higher accuracy than these on some data sets. The proposed solution seems sound (although I did not check the proofs in detail, and I am not very familiar with hardware energy consumption subtleties).\n\nQuestions:\n\nThe experiments in Sec. 6.2 suggest that the activation mask is mainly beneficial when the data is highly structured. How are the benefits (in terms of weight and activation sparsity) composed in the experiments on Imagenet? How does the weight sparsity of the the proposed method compare to the related methods in these experiments? Is weight sparsity in these cases a good proxy for energy consumption?\n\nHow does the activation sparsity (decay) parameter (\\delta) q affect the accuracy-energy consumption tradeoff for the two data sets?\n\nThe authors show that the weight projection problem can be solved efficiently. How does the guarantee translate into wall-clock time?\n\nFilter pruning methods [1,2] reduce both the size of the weight and activation tensors, while not requiring to solve a complicated projection problem or introducing activation masks. It would be good to compare to these methods, or at least comment on the gains to be expected under the proposed energy consumption model.\n\nKnowledge distillation has previously been observed to be quite helpful when constraining neural network weights to be quantized and/or sparse, see [3,4,5]. It might be worth mentioning this.\n\nMinor comments:\n- Sec. 3.4. 1st paragraph: subscript -> superscript\n- Sec. 6.2 first paragraph: pattens -> patterns, aliened -> aligned\n\n[1] He, Y., Zhang, X., & Sun, J.

Comparative results are shown on a few data sets where the proposed method outperforms multiple different approaches.  Overall, the concept is interesting and certainly could prove valuable in resource-constrained environments.  Still I retain some reservations as detailed below.\n\nMy first concern is that this paper exceeds the recommended 8 page limit for reasons that are seemingly quite unnecessary.  There are no large, essential figures/tables, and nearly the first 6 pages is just introduction and background material.  Likewise the paper consumes a considerable amount of space presenting technical results related to knapsack problems and various epsilon-accurate solutions, but this theoretical content seems somewhat irrelevant and distracting since it is not directly related to the greedy approximation strategy actually used for practical deployment.  Much of this material could have been moved to the supplementary so as to adhere to the 8 page soft limit.  Per the ICLR reviewer instructions, papers deemed unnecessarily long relative to this length should be judged more critically.\n\nAnother issue relates to the use of a mask for controlling the sparsity of network inputs.  Although not acknowledged, similar techniques are already used to prune the activations of deep networks for compression.  In particular, various forms of variational dropout essentially use multiplicative weights to remove the influence of activations and/or other network components similar to the mask M used is this work.  Representative examples include Neklyudov et al., \"Structured Bayesian Pruning via Log-Normal Multiplicative Noise,\" NIPS 2017 and Louizos et al., \"Bayesian Compression for Deep Learning,\" NIPS 2017, but there are many other related alternatives using some form of trainable gate or mask, possibly stochastic, to affect pruning (the major ML and CV conferences over the past year have numerous related compression papers).  So I don't consider this aspect of the paper to be new in any significant way.\n\nMoreover, for the empirical comparisons it would be better to compare against state-of-the-art compression methods as opposed to just the stated MP and SSL methods from 2015 and 2016 respectively.  Despite claims to the contrary on page 9, I would not consider these to be state-of-the-art methods at this point.\n\nAnother comment I have regarding the experiments is that hyperparameters and the use of knowledge distillation were potentially tuned for the proposed method and then simultaneously applied to the competing algorithms for the sake of head-to-head comparison.  But to me, if these enhancements are to be included at all, tuning must be done carefully and independently for each algorithm.  Was this actually done?  Moreover it would have been nice to see results without the confounding influence of distillation to isolate sources of improvement, but no ablation studies were presented.\n\nFinally, regarding the content in Section 5, the paper carefully presents an explicit bound on energy that ultimately leads to a constraint that is NP-hard just to project on to, although approximate solutions exist that depend on some error tolerance.  However, even this requires an algorithm that is dismissed as \"complicated.\"  Instead a greedy alternative is derived in the Appendix which presumably serves as the final endorsed approach.  But at this point it is no longer clear to me exactly what performance guarantees remain with respect to the energy bound.  Theorem 3 presents a fairly inscrutable bound, and it is not at all transparent how to interpret this in any practical sense.  Note that after Theorem 3, conditions are described whereby an optimal projection can be obtained, but these seem highly nuanced, and unlikely to apply in most cases.\n\nAdditionally, it would appear that crude bounds on the energy could also be introduced by simply penalizing/constraining the sparsity on each layer, which leads to a much simpler projection step.  For example, a simple affine function of the L0 norm would be much easier to optimize and could serve as a loose bound on the energy, given that the latter should be a non-decreasing function of the L0 norm.  Any idea how such a bound compares to those presented given all the approximations and greedy steps that must be included?\n\n\nOther comments:\n- As an implementation heuristic, the proposed Algorithm 1 gradually decays the parameter q, which controls the sparsity of the mask M.  But this will certainly alter the energy budget, and I wonder how important it is to employ a complex energy constraint if minimization requires this type of heuristic.\n\n- I did not see where the quantity L(M,W) embedded in eq. (17) was formally defined, although I can guess what it is.\n\n- In general it is somewhat troublesome that, on top of a complex, non-convex deep network energy function, just the small subproblem required for projecting onto the energy constraint is NP-hard.  Even if approximations are possible, I wonder if this extra complexity is always worth it relative so simple sparsity-based compression methods which can be efficiently implemented with exactly closed-form projections.\n\n- In Table 1, the proposed method is highlighted as having the smallest accuracy drop on SqueezeNet.  But this is not true, EAP is lower.  Likewise on AlexNet, NetAdapt has an equally optimal energy.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-Constrained Compression for Deep Neural Networks via Weighted Sparse Projection and Layer Input Masking", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in highly energy-constrained environments such as autonomous drones and wearable devices while at the same time must operate in real-time.

We clarify the questions point by point below and plan to sort out some confusions in our revision to improve the clarity.\n\n> \u201cMy first concern is that this paper exceeds the recommended 8 page limit for reasons that are seemingly quite unnecessary.  There are no large, essential figures/tables, and nearly the first 6 pages is just introduction and background material.\u201d\n\nWe think you refer to the Section 3.\nIn Section 3, we show how the energy of a DNN inference is analytical modelled. We want to include these details in the paper because they form the final energy constraint proposed in problem (18). In the revised version, we will take your suggestion to reduce the number of pages to 8 by condensing this section and moving the details of energy estimation into the Appendix.\n\n\n> \u201cLikewise the paper consumes a considerable amount of space presenting technical results related to knapsack problems and various epsilon-accurate solutions, but this theoretical content seems somewhat irrelevant and distracting since it is not directly related to the greedy approximation strategy actually used for practical deployment.  Much of this material could have been moved to the supplementary so as to adhere to the 8 page soft limit.\u201d\n\nThanks for your suggestion how to reduce the length to 8 pages. Please allow us to clarify the logic of our theorems first. All three algorithms are related to how to solve the key projection step in (22). Theorem 1 shows the projection problem in (22) is NP hard to find the exact optimal solution in general, since it is equivalent to a 0/1 knapsack problem. Theorem 2 shows the optimal computational complexity to find an epsilon *approximate* solution by utilizing the structure of the projection problem. Theorem 3 shows the proposed greedy algorithm (weighted projection algorithm) can achieve a reasonable precision efficiently. We feel that these theorems are useful in that they help understand the difficulty and the complexity of solving (22). We will consider moving Theorem 2 to the supplement in the first priority to shrink the length of this paper.\n\n\n> \u201cPrior work also uses a mask for controlling the sparsity of network inputs, such as \"Structured Bayesian Pruning via Log-Normal Multiplicative Noise,\" NIPS 2017 and Louizos et al., \"Bayesian Compression for Deep Learning,\" NIPS 2017. How do you compare with them?\u201d\n\nWe agree that there is prior work that uses a mask to prune the network activations (i.e., inputs). But we want to emphasize two key differences of our work. First, these two papers you mentioned use the mask (structure sparsity) to remove unnecessary channels; whereas our work uses the mask to filter unimportant elements within each channel, motivated by the observation that many areas in the input image do not really contribute to the recognition task such as the corners of the input image in the digital number recognition. These two mask techniques are orthogonal, and can even be combined.\n\nSecond, our mask model is integrated with an energy model to let us train energy-constrained DNNs; whereas these two papers purely aim at reducing the network parameters to get speedup.\n\nWe use their released code to train energy-constrained DNNs on the MNIST dataset, the results are below:\n+--------------------------------------+----------------------+----------+-----------------------------+\n| Method                                  | Accuracy Drop | Energy | Width of Each Layer |\n+--------------------------------------+----------------------+----------+-----------------------------+\n| [Louizos et al., NIPS'17]      | 2.2%                   | 26%      | 4-6-52-42                    |\n+--------------------------------------+----------------------+----------+-----------------------------+\n| [Neklyudov et al., NIPS'17] | 1.5%                   | 22%     | 3-10-23-28                  |\n+--------------------------------------+----------------------+----------+-----------------------------+\nOur method has 0.5% accuracy drop with 17% energy cost, better than the two approaches.\n\n\n> \u201cComparison against methods newer than MP and SSL.\u201d\n\nIn the experiment, we also compare against state-of-the-art pruning methods NetAdapt  [Yang et al., ECCV 2018] and EAP [Yang et al., CVPR 2017] and show favorable results (Please refer to Table 1 and Table 2).

But to me, if these enhancements are to be included at all, tuning must be done carefully and independently for each algorithm.  Was this actually done?  Moreover it would have been nice to see results without the confounding influence of distillation to isolate sources of improvement, but no ablation studies were presented.\u201d\n\nIn our early experiments, we did not use knowledge distillation in other methods and found that the performance is significantly worse than ours. Therefore, we apply the knowledge distillation in all the methods for fair comparison. Recent work (e.g., [Mishra et al., 2018] ) also support our observation that the knowledge distillation trick can significantly improve the test accuracy in other pruning methods. We verified that the performance was not very sensitive to the value of lambda as long as lambda is in a reasonable range. Therefore, we empirically choose lambda to be 0.5 universal to *all* datasets.\n\n[Mishra et al., 2018] Mishra, Asit, and Debbie Marr. \"Apprentice: Using knowledge distillation techniques to improve low-precision network accuracy.\" In ICLR 2018.\n\n\n> \u201cFinally, regarding the content in Section 5, the paper carefully presents an explicit bound on energy that ultimately leads to a constraint that is NP-hard just to project on to, although approximate solutions exist that depend on some error tolerance.  However, even this requires an algorithm that is dismissed as \"complicated.\"  Instead a greedy alternative is derived in the Appendix which presumably serves as the final endorsed approach.  But at this point it is no longer clear to me exactly what performance guarantees remain with respect to the energy bound.  Theorem 3 presents a fairly inscrutable bound, and it is not at all transparent how to interpret this in any practical sense.  Note that after Theorem 3, conditions are described whereby an optimal projection can be obtained, but these seem highly nuanced, and unlikely to apply in most cases.\u201d\n\nThe conditions under Theorem 3 are sufficient conditions to obtain the exactly optimal projection, i.e. the error bound is 0. However, we usually do not require such rigorous result in practice. Because the amount of parameters is very large in DNNs, the remaining budget R(W\u2019\u2019) is usually very small compared to E_budget. Therefore, the projection error bound is small enough in most cases.\nAnother practical aspect of Theorem 3 is quantifying the upper-bound of the projection error in (27). In practice, we can exactly calculate this error bound and even choose to use the more accurate (but slower) algorithm in Theorem 2 when this error bound is not acceptable.\n\n\n> \u201cAdditionally, it would appear that crude bounds on the energy could also be introduced by simply penalizing/constraining the sparsity on each layer, which leads to a much simpler projection step.  For example, a simple affine function of the L0 norm would be much easier to optimize and could serve as a loose bound on the energy, given that the latter should be a non-decreasing function of the L0 norm.  Any idea how such a bound compares to those presented given all the approximations and greedy steps that must be included?\u201d\n\nTo use a method based on sparsity constraint of each layer, one must identify the sparsity bound for each of the DNN layers in a way that the whole model satisfies the energy budget while minimizing the loss. Even if an affine function of a layer\u2019s sparsity bound can be used to estimate the layer\u2019s energy, we still need to optimize these sparsity variables collectively across all layers for the whole model. Thus, the effectiveness of the layer-wise approach rests upon if we could find the optimal sparsity combination for all the layers.\n\nNetAdapt [Yang et al., ECCV 2018] and AMC [He et al., ECCV 2018] already showed that it is non-trivial to find the optimal layer-wise spartisy bounds. NetAdapt proposed a heuristic-driven search algorithm. In our experiment, we compared against NetAdapt and show that we can achieve higher accuracy with lower or same energy consumption (Please see Table 1 and Table 2)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-Constrained Compression for Deep Neural Networks via Weighted Sparse Projection and Layer Input Masking", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in highly energy-constrained environments such as autonomous drones and wearable devices while at the same time must operate in real-time.

But this will certainly alter the energy budget, and I wonder how important it is to employ a complex energy constraint if minimization requires this type of heuristic.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of our proposed energy constraint is to exactly characterize the dependence between the sparsity of all parameters and the energy consumption, which provides us an (almost) exact energy model and a clear goal to guide us to pursue an energy efficient model. However, due to the nontrivial structure in the energy model, we have to involve some heuristics to solve it approximately. \n\n\n> \u201cI did not see where the quantity L(M,W) embedded in eq. (17) was formally defined, although I can guess what it is.\u201d\n\nThanks for pointing this out. L is the original loss, e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification. We will clarify this in the revision.\n\n\n> \u201cIn general it is somewhat troublesome that, on top of a complex, non-convex deep network energy function, just the small subproblem required for projecting onto the energy constraint is NP-hard.  Even if approximations are possible, I wonder if this extra complexity is always worth it relative so simple sparsity-based compression methods which can be efficiently implemented with exactly closed-form projections.\u201d\n\nAlthough the energy constrained problem is complex, our main contribution is to simplify it and propose an efficient method to solve it approximately. We measure the wall-clock time of the projection step, and across AlexNet, Squeezenet, and MobileNetV2, the projection step can be solved extremely efficiently -- within 0.2 seconds to be exact. Please also see our response to the 3rd question from Reviewer 3.\n\nIn addition, at the technique-level, using a simple sparsity-based compression method to train energy-constrained DNNs would require setting the sparsity threshold for each layer to satisfy the energy constraint while minimizing the loss. Such a hyper-parameter tuning is not trivial. We compare against one such method (NetAdapt) and demonstrate higher accuracy with lower/same energy (Please see Table 1 and Table 2).\n\n\n> \u201cIn Table 1, the proposed method is highlighted as having the smallest accuracy drop on SqueezeNet.  But this is not true, EAP is lower.  Likewise on AlexNet, NetAdapt has an equally optimal energy.\u201d\n\nIn Table 1, our evaluation methodology is to configure our method to have an energy that is *the same as or lower than the lowest energy of prior work*, and compare the accuracy drops. In the case of AlexNet, our approach has a lower accuracy drop compared to NetAdapt at the same energy consumption. In the case of SqueezeNet, we show that our approach has the lowest energy among all the methods with only 0.3% higher accuracy drop than EAP. In Figure 2, we perform a comprehensive study where we vary the energy consumption of our method. We show that our method can train a network that has lower energy and less accuracy drop (the rightmost solid blue square) compared to EAP.\n\nWe will clarify our writing in the revision."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1540/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Energy-Constrained Compression for Deep Neural Networks via Weighted Sparse Projection and Layer Input Masking", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in highly energy-constrained environments such as autonomous drones and wearable devices while at the same time must operate in real-time.

Rather, it is a byproduct of energy saving. In fact, we observe that weight spartisy is *not* a good proxy for energy consumption, as also confirmed by prior work EAP [Yang et al., CVPR 2017].

Could the authors please elaborate on this sentence?\u201d\n\nScaleSim simulates the DNN hardware execution cycle by cycle, from which it derives the total execution time and energy consumption of executing a network on the hardware. In this paper, we model the energy consumption of an network analytically (Section 3, in particular Equation 16); we compare the energy consumption analytical derived by our approach with the energy consumption estimated from ScaleSim (which simulates the hardware executions), and found that the two matched.\n\n\n> \u201cOne of the main assumptions is the following. If the value of the data is zero, the hardware can skip accessing the data. As far as I know, this is a quite strong assumption, that is not supported by many architectures. How do the authors take into account overhead of using sparse data formats in such hardware in their estimations? Is it possible to simulate such behavior in ScaleSim? Moreover, in many modern systems DRAM can only be read in chunks. Therefore it can decrease number of DRAM accesses in (4).\u201d\n\nIn many today\u2019s DNN hardware the activations and weights are compressed in the dense form, and thus only non-zero values will be accessed. This is done in prior work [Chen et al., 2016; Parashar et al., 2017]. There is a negligible amount of overhead to \u201cunpack\u201d and \u201cpack\u201d compressed data, which we simply take away from the energy budget as a constant factor. This is also the same modeling assumption used by EAP [Yang et al., CVPR 2017].\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that DRAM is accessed in bursts, which we did account for in our modeling. In particular, the per-access energy eDRAM we used in the modeling is the amortized energy of each access across the entire bursts. That is, instead of decreasing the number of DRAM accesses, we decrease the per-access energy.

While most works on compression are dedicated to decreasing the number of parameters or decreasing the number of operations to speed-up or reducing of memory footprint, these approaches do not provide any guarantees on energy consumption. In this work the authors derived a loss for training NN with energy constraints and provided an optimization algorithm for it. The authors showed that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with lower energy consumption given the same energy budget. The experimental results are quite interesting and include even highly optimized network MobileNetV2.\n\nSeveral questions and concerns.\n\u2018Our energy modeling results are validated against the industry-strength DNN hardware simulator ScaleSim\u2019. Could the authors please elaborate on this sentence?\n\nOne of the main assumptions is the following. If the value of the data is zero, the hardware can skip accessing the data. As far as I know, this is a quite strong assumption, that is not supported by many architectures. How do the authors take into account overhead of using sparse data formats in such hardware in their estimations? Is it possible to simulate such behavior in ScaleSim? Moreover, in many modern systems DRAM can only be read in chunks. Therefore it can decrease number of DRAM accesses in (4).\n\nSmall typos and other issues:\nPage 8. \u2018There exists an algorithm that can find an an \\epsilon\u2019\nPage 8.\u2019 But it is possible to fan approximate solution\u2019\nPage 4.
