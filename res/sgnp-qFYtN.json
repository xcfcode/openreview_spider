The proposed algorithm exploits the properties of commonly used activation functions to cast the sparsification problem as the minimization of a sparsity measure subject to approximation accuracy constraints. The proposed problem can be solved using convex optimization.\n\nPros:\n\nThe authors\u2019 insights about popular activation functions and the approach used to cast the sparsification problem as a convex optimization problem are clever and interesting. The authors presented experiments on a wide range of deep learning models and tasks.\n\nCons:\n\nSome of the details of the authors experiments are not clear or potentially misleading:\n1. Some results presented for existing techniques are from those techniques\u2019 original papers, but some results were re-run by the authors. For example, consider the ResNet-50 results on ImageNet (table 3, left). The RigL authors did not present results at 60% sparsity, and Appendix D does not include details on how this number was generated beyond the authors using the released code with RigL. The numbers at 80% and 90% sparsity are taken from the RigL paper. However, these numbers were achieved with 5x the number of training steps which was enabled by the reduced number of FLOPs used by RigL during training because it maintains a constant level of sparsity throughout the training process. They also use non-uniform distributions of sparsity across the layers of the network which affects the number of FLOPs in the resultant network. The author\u2019s of this paper report a lower top-1 accuracy at 60% sparsity than the RigL paper reports at 80% sparsity, which leads me to believe that the training conditions (time, sparsity distribution) are not the same. Similarly, all of the RigL results for MobileNet family models (table 3, right) appear to have been run by the authors and the training setup details are not clear. For these results generated by the authors of this paper, they should also detail the amount of hyperparameter tuning performed for these baseline, as this can make a large difference in accuracy. I focused here on RigL because it appears to be the most commonly used baseline by the authors of this paper, but it seems likely that these observations apply to other techniques as well.\n2. Using RigL as the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d baseline for most comparisons is not entirely fair given it has additional capabilities (i.e., the ability to enable sparse training by maintaining a constant number of parameters across training) compared to the authors\u2019 proposed post-training sparsification algorithm. Sparse training (i.e., sparse-to-sparse training) is known to be a more difficult problem than dense-to-sparse training [1] or post-training sparsification. It is good to include RigL for comparison, but this distinction should be made clear and other techniques that have comparable ability to the proposed technique should be included as well.\n\nMy suggestion to the authors are the following:\n1. All results should be reported as accuracy with a given parameter count and accuracy with a given FLOP count. Ideally, these tradeoff curves should be plotted across a range of accuracies and FLOP counts. This helps to avoid many of the pitfalls in the comparisons of model compression approaches details by [2] and [3].\n2. Make it clear that some algorithms under comparison have additional capabilities compared to the proposed approach (e.g., RigL with sparse training).\n3. Add comparisons with other algorithms of similar capability to the proposed approach. The magnitude pruning approach of Zhu & Gupta [1] would be ideal for this I believe.\n\nComments:\n\nThe brackets are backwards in the last paragraph on page 4. I would encourage the authors to explain more of the background of their approach (proximal operators, convex optimization, etc.) in sections 3 and 4. Many of those working in model compression who would be interested in this work will not be familiar with these topics.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01878\n2. https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09574\n3. https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03033 \n\n[original score: 3 (clear rejection)]\n11/24: Updated score based on updates from the authors.

The RigL results that you did not run (80%/90% sparsity in table 3) were run with 5x the number of training steps, but it looks like the experiments that you ran for 60% sparsity and 96.5% sparsity were run with less (I assume 1x). I think the best way to fix this oddity is for you to report their 1x training time results for 80%/90% sparsity in your table and then acknowledge in the text that RigL is a technique designed for sparse-to-sparse training, which could enable additional training time thanks to the training time FLOP savings.\n2. You should be clear that when you say \"FLOPs\" you mean FLOPs at inference time. This is clear in the introduction but some of the captions and text in the experiments section does not note this.\n3. You should report how you calculated FLOPs. They are often counted differently (e.g., with a multiply-add counted as 1) and it's easy to make mistakes in these calculations.\n\nThe technique of Zhu & Gupta is implemented in the TensorFlow model pruning library (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/model_pruning).

The key idea is to make the outputs of the neurons in the sparse and dense networks at the same input close enough. They rewrite the activation function as the proximity operator of a proper convex function and finally formulate the compression problem into a constraint minimization problem using the technique of subdifferential inclusion. They conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of their proposed methods.\n\nPositive aspects:\n1.\tThe idea of this paper makes sense. \n2.\tThe experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the baselines under this paper\u2019s experimental setting. \n3.\tThis paper is well written and easy to follow. \n\nMy concerns are:\n\n1. In the proposed model, we need to choose proper value of $\\eta$ for each layer, which is the required accuracy of the neuron\u2019 output after compression. I understand that as reported by the authors in this paper, only in few experiments, they need to search for a good $\\eta$. However, I think it is non-trivial to find proper value for $\\eta$. I mean that different layers could have different tolerances on accuracy.  Since our goal is to achieve high test accuracy in the compressed network instead of the accuracy of the neuron\u2019 output after compression, if we can find better values for $\\eta$ we could achieve higher test accuracy. In other words, as it is challenging to find  near optimal $\\eta$ for each layer, we could not reduce the network into very small size. \n\n2. Because of my above concern, I recommend the authors to give more results of compressing networks into much smaller sizes. For example, in RigL, the size of ResNet50 on ImageNet is compressed by more than 97%.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3450/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3450/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sparsifying Networks via Subdifferential Inclusion", "authorids": ["~Sagar_Verma1", "~Jean-Christophe_Pesquet1"], "authors": ["Sagar Verma", "Jean-Christophe Pesquet"], "keywords": ["neural networks", "pruning after training", "weight pruning", "proximal operator", "fixed point iteration"], "abstract": "Sparsifying deep neural networks is of paramount interest in many areas, especially when those networks have to be implemented on low-memory devices.
