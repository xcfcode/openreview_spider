This approach is compared to a random forest classifier on the feature activations, which yields significantly higher performances. Additionally, the authors point out that ResNet can be finetuned to yield even higher performance.\n\nSince the Neural Style algorithm works very well at transferring style, I am surprised by the fact that it works that badly for classifying style and would take that to be the main result of the submission. However in my optinion the submission is missing any analysis of why the representation is that much worse than other methods. From examples of correct predictions and wrong predictions, one might get interesting insights in what exactly the style representation is incoding and what it is missing with respect to style classification.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Style Representations of Fine Art", "abstract": "The artistic style of a painting is a subtle aesthetic judgment used by art historians for grouping and classifying artwork.
