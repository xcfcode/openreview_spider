From their results we can derive that our best multi-threaded code would improve over a single GPU implementation by 4-20x depending on the choice of Skipgram/CBOW and subwords/no subwords.\n\nWhat is more, we have now compared 20-threaded runs of our no_subword variant to the 20-threaded runs of the original word2vec code (which was not included in the paper), and achieved 5-6x speedups. This is much greater than those obtained on a K20 GPU by Bae & Yi (2016) for word2vec with negative sampling over (only) 12-threaded CPU runs (1.4-1.6x speedups). We\u2019ve added a discussion on this in the related work.\n\nIndeed, not every algorithm is suitable for GPUs if it lacks the very fine-grained parallelism for SIMD multithreading. Fine-grained parallelism is limited partially by small vector sizes typically used to represent word embeddings. In addition to that, word2vec and fastText are memory-intensive algorithms where the potential benefits of parallelism are capped by memory bandwidth.\n\nA large-scale distributed implementation is expected to yield further speedups: we have added a short comment in the section on related work, on why we do not need more communication than required by the original fastText algorithm. Furthermore, our contribution would still apply for the computation inside the nodes. However, distributed computing requires a cluster. In many real-world settings a cluster may not be available (e.g., an embedded scenario) or the users may just want to run training on their own workstation."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1805/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1805/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Faster Training of Word Embeddings", "authorids": ["~Eliza_Wszola1", "~Martin_Jaggi1", "~Markus_P\u00fcschel1"], "authors": ["Eliza Wszola", "Martin Jaggi", "Markus P\u00fcschel"], "keywords": ["multicore", "performance", "machine learning", "word embeddings", "word2vec", "fasttext"], "abstract": "Word embeddings have gained increasing popularity in the recent years due to the Word2vec library and its extension fastText that uses subword information.

How to do this in a careful, architecture-cognizant way is not just engineering but research. For example in the well-established area of scientific computing, but also in embedded computing, entire conferences are dedicated to this problem of how to create highly optimized implementations and the areas benefit from the availability of the corresponding available open source implementations and from the knowledge of how to create them. The available high level methods (SIMD vectorization, blocking for locality, loop merging, scalar replacement, establishing instruction-level parallelism etc., parallelization, avoiding false sharing, and many more) are well-understood but instantiate themselves very differently for different algorithms. How to do this is the research and the measure of success is the speedup obtained. **We believe that ICLR explicitly values and asks for this type of research by explicitly listing in the Call for Papers at https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForPapers among the relevant topics: \u201cimplementation issues, parallelization, software platforms, hardware.\u201d**"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1805/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1805/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Faster Training of Word Embeddings", "authorids": ["~Eliza_Wszola1", "~Martin_Jaggi1", "~Markus_P\u00fcschel1"], "authors": ["Eliza Wszola", "Martin Jaggi", "Markus P\u00fcschel"], "keywords": ["multicore", "performance", "machine learning", "word embeddings", "word2vec", "fasttext"], "abstract": "Word embeddings have gained increasing popularity in the recent years due to the Word2vec library and its extension fastText that uses subword information.

To improve the efficiency, it uses several techniques such as negative sample sharing, batched updates, and a byte-pair encoding-based alternative for subword units. By using English, German, and Russian languages data, it shows that the proposed approach is much faster than the existing approaches. \n\nBasically, I like the motivation and results of the paper; it is quite an important research problem to reduce training times of popular word embedding approaches. Besices, this paper is well structured and easy to follow; contributions are clear and proposed approaches are well described. However, the approaches proposed in the paper are somewhat technically shallow. I think more technical depth is needed for ICLR papers. This paper seems to be an engineering or industrial paper rather than a research paper; ICLR is not the best venue for the paper. To improve the paper, it is good to clearly describe the highlight of the proposed approach and explicitly show its theoretical property. While several approaches are described in Section 3, I think one or two approaches with detailed technical analyses are enough.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1805/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1805/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Faster Training of Word Embeddings", "authorids": ["~Eliza_Wszola1", "~Martin_Jaggi1", "~Markus_P\u00fcschel1"], "authors": ["Eliza Wszola", "Martin Jaggi", "Markus P\u00fcschel"], "keywords": ["multicore", "performance", "machine learning", "word embeddings", "word2vec", "fasttext"], "abstract": "Word embeddings have gained increasing popularity in the recent years due to the Word2vec library and its extension fastText that uses subword information.
