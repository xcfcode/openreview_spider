Although the proposed method makes use RNN cell to replace the heavy MLP layer after self-attention. I still think there's no significant difference between vanilla Transformer. The authors also propose to use position aware bi-directional attention mechanism. While it's hard to say whether it's better than multi-head self-attention in Transformer and the authors don't have an ablation study on this. Moreover, I would like to see some model comparisons on more popular datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, etc.\n\nCons:\n1. It is hard to tell the benefits of the proposed method compared to vanilla Transformer. The motivation for integrating RNN cell is not clear enough for me. If Feed Forward Network is a big concern on speed, there should have some fair comparison on speed.\n2. If the authors care more about final performance.

In particular, the authors define a bidirectional RNN with attention by a fixed point equation and then transform it to a variant of the Transformer block. The proposed model StarSaber is shown to be more parameter efficient than the Transformer model and achieve competitive performance on three CLUE datasets.\n\n\nPros: \n+ This paper proposes a framework of transforming RNNs to Transformer-style models by incorporating the attention mechanism.\n+ Several ablation studies are conducted to support the design choices.\n\n\nCons: \n-\tThis paper aims to transform the RNN from the perspective of fixed point equations. But in Eq. (4), different weights are assigned to different layers, which means the model is actually iterating different functions at each timestep (layer). Thus, indeed it\u2019s not a fixed point equation and the proposed model is actually a variant of the Transformer model with a modified structure, so the whole story does not make too much sense to me.\n-\tThe difference between the proposed StarSaber block and the Transformer block needs to be highlighted and discussed more clearly in the main content.\n-\tThe dataset and the pretraining task used for experiments are not commonly used and small-scale. It would be more convincing to include experiments on common and larger-scale benchmarks (e.g., SQuAD and GLUE).\n-\tThe paper is not very well-written and is a bit tedious, for example:\n    1)\tThe related work section is not well organized and includes some unnecessary contents like the discussions about pretraining and MLM. Some discussions about related works on implicit deep learning models could be included, e.g., Deep Equilibrium Models [1], Invertible Residual Networks [2], and Implicit Deep Learning [3].\n    2)\tEq. (2) \u2013 Eq. (4) are three similar sets of equations and rewriting could be avoided. \n    3)\tThe experiment section includes some experimental details that are not very important (e.g., the dataset statistics) which could be moved to the appendix.\n\n\nAdditional Comments/Questions: \n1.\tAs in the StarSaber model, the linear transformation weights for all the future positions and all the past positions are shared ($U^{right}$ and $U^{left}$ respectively). It seems that it incorporates weaker positional information than the positional embedding of the standard Transformer model since it could not directly distinguish between those future positions (and past positions). Therefore, I feel surprised about the ablation study regarding the positional encoding. Could you provide more details about this experiment and explain more about the result?\n2.\tIt would be great to include some comparison of the computational cost of the StarSaber model and the Transformer model.\n3.\tHow do you tune the learning rate for all the models?\n4.\tTheorem 3.1 is for real-valued function, it would be better to use a vectorized version as the functions considered in the paper are all vector-valued.\n5.\tTypo: dadtaset - > dataset\n\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01377\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00995\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06315\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper17/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper17/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transforming Recurrent Neural Networks with Attention and Fixed-point Equations", "authorids": ["~Zhaobin_Xu2", "~Baotian_Hu1", "~Buzhou_Tang1"], "authors": ["Zhaobin Xu", "Baotian Hu", "Buzhou Tang"], "keywords": ["Fixed-point", "Attention", "Feed Forward Network", "Transformer", "Recurrent Neural Network", "Deep Learning"], "abstract": "Transformer has achieved state of the art performance in multiple Natural Language Processing tasks recently.

In equation (3), there is a weight matrix V, while it becomes V^l in equation (4). I am wondering which model is used in reality? Changing V to V^l is irrelevant to the fixed point scheme. I believe that based on the motivation, the weight matrix V should be shared.\n\n2. Many people believe that MLP in transformers is used for universal approximation. Dropping MLP in StarSaber makes me concerned about even approximation capability of the proposed model.\n\n3. I am confused about how the model shown in Figure 1 is related to Equation (5)? Where the masked attention and linear transformers come from based on your derivation in Equations (3)-(5)? \n\n4. All the experiments seem to have been done at quite small scales.

The basic idea is to simply allow every cell to read the from all other cells instead of just the one immediately preceding.\n\nThe authors present the interesting of idea of defining the model as a system of equations to solve instead of as a set of update rules. This approach is interesting but not novel. It was presented in \"Deep Equilibrium Models\" (Bai et al. (2019)).\n\nThe authors of this paper however cite \"Deep Equilibrium Models\" but then seem to abandon the idea and instead decide to abandon root-finding for the system of equations and go back to a pretty ordinary MLP. They claim that the MLP \"approximates\" root-finding, but, as far as I can tell, the authors don't even try to check whether the \"approximation\" they created is actually approaching a solution for the system of equations or is doing something else altogether.\n\nThe authors additionally report some gains by having a more complex position encoding and by adding residual connections.\n\nIn addition the authors propose a quick pretraining strategy based on masked language modeling on the concatenation of training, dev and test sets from the target tasks. It is not surprising that this helps, since they don't do large scale pretraining, but it's also dangerously close to cheating to include the test set in pretraining, even if the test labels are not available.\n\nOverall the paper is promising and I would like to see more work on this, but right now there is a lot of space for improvement:\n* the authors should actually try to solve the system of equations that expresses their model, even if they use a different technique from Bai et al. (2019) -- otherwise just reframe your paper as a modification to the transformer architecture and don't mention the fixed-point approach.\n* the authors shouldn't pretrain on the test set.\n* experimental results would stronger if they were compared directly to results from other papers. If the authors don't want to run large-scale pretraining they might want to find a low resource setting with competitive results from other papers.\n", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper17/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper17/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Transforming Recurrent Neural Networks with Attention and Fixed-point Equations", "authorids": ["~Zhaobin_Xu2", "~Baotian_Hu1", "~Buzhou_Tang1"], "authors": ["Zhaobin Xu", "Baotian Hu", "Buzhou Tang"], "keywords": ["Fixed-point", "Attention", "Feed Forward Network", "Transformer", "Recurrent Neural Network", "Deep Learning"], "abstract": "Transformer has achieved state of the art performance in multiple Natural Language Processing tasks recently. Yet the Feed Forward Network(FFN) in a Transformer block is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a framework to transform Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) and their variants into self-attention-style models, with an approximation of Banach Fixed-point Theorem. Within this framework, we propose a new model, StarSaber, by solving a set of equations obtained from RNN with Fixed-point Theorem and further approximate it with a Multi-layer Perceptron. It provides a view of stacking layers. StarSaber achieves better performance than both the vanilla Transformer and an improved version called ReZero on three datasets and is more computationally efficient, due to the reduction of Transformer's FFN layer. It has two major parts. One is a way to encode position information with two different matrices. For every position in a sequence, we have a matrix operating on positions before it and another matrix operating on positions after it. The other is the introduction of direct paths from the input layer to the rest of layers. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of these two parts.
