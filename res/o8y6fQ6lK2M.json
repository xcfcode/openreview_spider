Specifically, given a node embedding representation algorithm, we consider the case when these embeddings are real-valued. By viewing these embeddings as scalar functions on a domain of interest, we can utilize the tools available in persistent homology to study the topological information encoded in these representations. Our construction effectively defines a unique persistence-based graph descriptor, on both the graph and node levels, for every node representation algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we study the topological descriptors induced by DeepWalk, Node2Vec and Diff2Vec.
