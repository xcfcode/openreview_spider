The authors mention running multiple SVD (until convergence) \"with the sources of randomness being due to a random permutation of the adjacency matrix given as input to the SVD method and the random seed it uses\". However, from linear algebra we know the results of SVD are deterministic (up to a sign, which can be easily dealt with). For the food web example, the graph contains two set of eigenvectors (with the same eigenvalue), each set having all-zero elements for a connected component. As a result, the 'randomness' seems to be purely from how to arrange these eigenvectors? (In other words, for a graph with distinct eigenvalues, the results should be exactly the same). In any case, I would suggest a normal matrix factorization using gradient descent be a better example, since the randomness is clearer in MF than SVD.

By careful definition of what structural node representation means, and what node embedding means, using the permutation group, the authors show in Theorem 2 that node embeddings cannot represent any extra information that is not already in the structural representation. The paper then provide empirical experiments on three tasks, and show in a fourth task an illustration of the theoretical results.\n\nThe reviewers of the paper scored the paper highly, but with low confidence. I read the paper myself (unfortunately not with a lot of time), with the aim of increasing the confidence of the resulting decision. The main gap in the paper is between the phrases \"structural node representation\" and \"node embedding\", and their theoretical definitions. The analogy of distribution and its samples follows unsurprisingly from the definitions (8 and 12), but the interpretation of those definitions as the corresponding English phrases is not obvious by only looking at the definitions. There also seems to be a sleight of hand going on with the most expressive representations (Definitions 9 and 11), which is used to make the conditional independence statement of Theorem 2. The authors should clarify in the final version whether the existence of such a representation can be shown, or even better a constructive way to get it from data.\n\nGiven the significance of the theoretical results, the authors should improve the introduction of the two main concepts by:\n- relating them to prior work (one way is to move Section 5 towards the front)\n- explaining in greater detail why Definitions 8 and 12 correspond to the two concepts. For example expanding the part of the proof of Corollary 1 about SVD, to make clear what Definition 12 means.\n- a corresponding simple example of Definition 8 to relate to a classical method.\n\nThe paper provides a nice connection between two disparate concepts. Unfortunately, the connection uses graph invariance and equivariance, which is unfamiliar to many of the ICLR audience. On balance, I believe that the authors can improve the presentation such that a reader can understand the implications of the connection without being an expert in graph isomorphism. As such, I am recommending an accept.\n\n", "title": "Paper Decision"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bsriniv@purdue.edu", "ribeiro@cs.purdue.edu"], "title": "On the Equivalence between Positional Node Embeddings and Structural Graph Representations", "authors": ["Balasubramaniam Srinivasan", "Bruno Ribeiro"], "pdf": "/pdf/f09dce2089f54246bef56fb0cbd14717aa609772.pdf", "TL;DR": "We develop the foundations of a unifying theoretical framework connecting node embeddings and structural graph representations through invariant theory", "abstract": "This work provides the first unifying theoretical framework for node (positional) embeddings and structural graph representations, bridging methods like matrix factorization and graph neural networks.

And we would like to stress your importance in the discussion phase, as the only reviewer who has published papers in the area (the other two reviewers selected \u201cI do not know much about this area\u201d).\n\nWe would like to emphasize that our work also has tremendous practical implications. Through it, we now understand why standard GNNs fail to predict links, and why methods that fix the issue (RGNN, SEAL, \u2026) will propose randomized methods (because they rely on node embeddings to learn a joint two-node representation). Moreover, all these years we have been using Monte Carlo methods (matrix factorization, variational GNNs) without treating them as Monte Carlo: e.g., multiple matrix factorizations (MF\u2019s) should be better than just one, and non-unique factorizations (variance), previously perceived as a foe in numerical methods, is now a potential friend. More precisely, we prove any graph task *must rely* on transforming the Monte Carlo samples (node embeddings) back into a structural representation. More samples => better representations. Hence, a method with more samples (where high-variance samples are not very informative) [e.g., MC-SVD] may be more accurate than a method with fewer samples (where samples are more informative) [e.g., SVD]. To the best of our knowledge, the research community was unaware of this fundamental trade-off. \n\nIn addition, we also prove that all tasks that can be performed by node embeddings can also be performed by structural representations and vice-versa - which allow us to do tasks with GNNs and matrix factorization that were perceived to be beyond the reach of these methods, respectively. We also expect our results will spark a number of hybrid MF-GNN papers."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1832/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1832/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bsriniv@purdue.edu", "ribeiro@cs.purdue.edu"], "title": "On the Equivalence between Positional Node Embeddings and Structural Graph Representations", "authors": ["Balasubramaniam Srinivasan", "Bruno Ribeiro"], "pdf": "/pdf/f09dce2089f54246bef56fb0cbd14717aa609772.pdf", "TL;DR": "We develop the foundations of a unifying theoretical framework connecting node embeddings and structural graph representations through invariant theory", "abstract": "This work provides the first unifying theoretical framework for node (positional) embeddings and structural graph representations, bridging methods like matrix factorization and graph neural networks.

The authors define node embedding and structural graph representation based on a minimal number of requirements, which is, in turn, used to derive some useful properties and unify two seemly different concepts. Based on these, a new graph neural network framework is proposed. The experiments on multiple tasks with multiple datasets validate the main claim that a single node embedding is insufficient to capture the structural representation of a graph.\n\nOverall, this paper tries to suggest a solution to a somewhat confusing and controversial problem that everyone recognises but hard to figure out a clear resolution. In that sense, this paper would serve as a good starting point by providing some theoretical baselines. I would like to see more discussion on this topic in future.\n\nIn many graph problems where each node is endowed with a certain feature set, we often observe the case where two subsets of nodes are isomorphic in terms of link structure but with different edge of node features. It would be good if there are some discussions on these cases.\n\nHere's a minor comment on the representation of the paper. Although the concept of node embedding and structural representations get clearer as reading, the introduction, where I couldn't find any reference of these, seems unlikely to clarify the difference between these two concepts. The familiar representation in Section 3 might be the first part where the readers could get some intuition about their differences.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1832/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1832/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["bsriniv@purdue.edu", "ribeiro@cs.purdue.edu"], "title": "On the Equivalence between Positional Node Embeddings and Structural Graph Representations", "authors": ["Balasubramaniam Srinivasan", "Bruno Ribeiro"], "pdf": "/pdf/f09dce2089f54246bef56fb0cbd14717aa609772.pdf", "TL;DR": "We develop the foundations of a unifying theoretical framework connecting node embeddings and structural graph representations through invariant theory", "abstract": "This work provides the first unifying theoretical framework for node (positional) embeddings and structural graph representations, bridging methods like matrix factorization and graph neural networks.
