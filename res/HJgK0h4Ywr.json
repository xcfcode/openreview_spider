We would like to address your concerns as follows:\n\n1) >> My main concern with the paper, \u2026\nThe main reason for focusing on FactorVAEs and BetaVAEs is that the two models clearly highlight the difference between metrics, and these justify the need for better metrics, which motivated our research in the first place. As shown in Figs. 5a,b and Figs. 7a,b, RMIG and JEMMIG favor FactorVAEs to BetaVAEs while \u201cDisentanglement\u201d and \u201cCompleteness\u201d favor BetaVAEs over FactorVAEs. Such contradiction between two evaluation systems allows us to confidently infer that our metrics are more accurate than those in [1] if we can show that FactorVAEs actually learn better disentangled representations than BetaVAEs. In our paper, we verify this hypothesis using visualization (Fig. 4 and Fig. 16), and also draw from the support by the work of Kim et. al., 2018 [2].\n\nThe AAE models, on the other hand, do not reveal differences between metrics. Both ours and those metrics in [1] show that AAEs are not as good as BetaVAEs but with different gaps (https://ibb.co/7NxtTvQ (JEMMIG), https://ibb.co/g9hKKYJ (RMIG), https://ibb.co/gS4fbtm (Disentanglement), https://ibb.co/PWL83Mm (Completeness)). Visualization also provides little help because neither BetaVAEs nor AAEs show good interpretability.\n\nPlease note that the experiments on FactorVAEs and BetaVAEs are mainly to show that our metrics produce more accurate and more reasonable results than the metrics in [1]. There are other advantages of our metrics that these metrics do not have. For example, our metrics are theoretically sound, our metrics do not use classifiers, our metrics produce a single score (compared to 3 different scores of [1]). We refer Reviewer 1 to Table 1, Appdx. 7, Appdx. 8 for detailed analyses.\n\nHowever, we agree with the Reviewer 1 that our work has not covered all possible edge cases and there may exist situations in which our metrics can be fooled (and it does not mean that existing metrics cannot be fooled in these cases). We leave this room for future exploration and hope that other researchers can improve upon our work to derive better metrics for disentanglement learning. \n\n2) >> The paper presents six metrics \u2026\nWe thank Reviewer 1 for pointing that out. We have revised the Discussion section to highlight WSEPIN and JEMMIG as our key metrics.\n\n3) >> The paper is not self-contained, and some parts are almost impossible to understand without \u2026\nWe acknowledge that we assume readers are familiar with FactorVAEs, BetaVAEs, AAEs before reading our paper. We have added detailed description of these models in the Appdx. 1 in the revised version. \n\n>>Some hyperparameters (TC, Beta) were used without explanation\u2026\nIn the revised version, we have added a sentence to the second paragraph in the Experiment section to explicitly describe these hyperparameters.\n\n4) >> There is no related work section. Such a section could, e.g., make what is borrowed from (Kim & Mnih, 2018; Higgins et al., 2017a) more understandable.\nThank you for pointing that out. Since the main text is already quite long (Reviewer 2 even advises to cut 2 pages down!), we chose to embed related work in Introduction and focus on the metrics. More detailed comparisons between our metrics and the existing work are included in Appdx. 8: Analysis of existing metrics for disentanglement.\n\n5) >> The definitions of SEPIN@k and INDIN@k don\u2019t seem quite right\u2026 \nIn case of SEPIN@k and INDIN@k, we want to do both sorting and re-indexing. We have modified our notations in the revised version to resolve the ambiguity pointed out by Reviewer 1.\n\n6) >> Page 8, interpretability: \u201cTC=10\u201d. Do you \u2026\n\u2018TC\u2019 here refers to the coefficient of the additional TC loss in the FactorVAE model. It is the gamma hyperparameter in the original FactorVAE paper (Kim et. al., 2018)\n\n7) Finally, we thank Reviewer 1 for pointing out typos in our paper and we have fixed all of them in our revised version.\n\nReferences\n==========\n[1] A framework for the quantitative evaluation of disentangled representations, Eastwood and Williams, 2018\n[2] Disentangling by factorizing, Kim et. al., 2018\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper273/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper273/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Theory and Evaluation Metrics for Learning Disentangled Representations", "authors": ["Kien Do", "Truyen Tran"], "authorids": ["dkdo@deakin.edu.au", "truyen.tran@deakin.edu.au"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "metrics"], "abstract": "We make two theoretical contributions to disentanglement learning by (a) defining precise semantics of disentangled representations, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluation.

Disentangled representations are evaluated along three dimensions: informativeness, separability, and interpretability. While previous work offers metrics for similar dimensions (e.g., (Eastwood & Williams, 2018)), the paper suggests that the metrics of the submission are superior to (Eastwood & Williams, 2018), based on a comparison between FactorVAE and Beta-VAE.\n\nStrengths:\n\n(1) The metrics of the paper are well motivated from an information-theoretic standpoint. While, in some cases, the metrics themselves are straight applications of information theory (e.g., informativeness metric == mutual information), the authors came up with new metrics when existing information-theoretic definitions could be fooled by, e.g., introducing noisy and independent latent representations z.\n\n(2) Experimental results show that these metrics are better than previous metrics at discriminating between FactorVAE and Beta-VAE (in an experimental setting where the former is clearly superior to the latter).\n\n(3) As opposed to much of prior work, these metrics do not require any training, which can be considered a plus as they do not require adaptation for each (sub)domain.\n\n(4) The paper is overall well written and clear. I very much enjoyed reading it.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n(1) My main concern with the paper, which makes me vote for \u201cweak accept\u201d instead of \u201caccept\u201d: The metrics of the paper are compared against previous metrics (Eastwood & Williams, 2018) on *only two* types of disentangled representations, namely FactorVAE and Beta-VAE, and in one experimental condition. (There is plenty of other experimental material in the appendix which also introduces AAE, but none of it seems to compare against previous *metrics*). I think comparing metrics on only two systems is somewhat problematic, and we don\u2019t know how general the results are. I would have preferred to see FactorVAE and Beta-VAE evaluated with fewer hyperparameter choices to allow introducing more variational approaches. Could you (the authors) at least evaluate AAE against Eastwood & Williams too? This concern is not just mere quibbling, as the authors have shown (e.g., in Section 3.2) that specific edge cases can fool na\u00efve metrics (e.g., by introducing noisy and independent latent variables), and there may be other edge cases that the authors have not considered. I think evaluating new metrics against previous work (i.e., metrics) on only two underlying systems is not very convincing. I acknowledge that the paper offers *lots* of experiments \u2013 the full pdf is 30 pages (!) \u2013 but I think some of the existing ones could go to leave space for evaluations using more underlying VAE/baselines/edge-case systems.\n\n(2) The paper presents six metrics (MI, MISJED, WSEPIN, WINDIN, RMIG, JEMMIG) along three dimensions. While each individual metric makes sense, I feel the paper lacks a discussion section that ties these pieces together and suggests a way of using these metrics conjointly across the three dimensions towards building better-disentangled representations (the paper has a \u201cdiscussion\u201d section, but it is very short and actually more of a conclusion). The more metrics we have, the more chances each underlying VAE model can \u201cwin\u201d on one of the metrics, which is not particularly enlightening. \n\n(3) The paper is not self-contained, and some parts are almost impossible to understand without familiarity with (Kim & Mnih, 2018) and (Higgins et al., 2017a). It uses technical terms of these papers without explanations (e.g., TC is not even spelled out it seems). Hyperparameters of these papers (e.g., beta, gamma) are used without explanation.\n\n(4) There is no related work section. Such a section could, e.g., make what is borrowed from (Kim & Mnih, 2018; Higgins et al., 2017a) more understandable.\n\nOverall, I think it is a nice paper that makes significant contributions to the problem of building better disentangles representations thanks to better evaluation metrics. The empirical support for some of the claims (e.g., superiority to (Eastwood & Williams, 2018)) is a bit weak, but other strengths mentioned above largely make up for that.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nThe definitions of SEPIN@k and INDIN@k don\u2019t seem quite right. The summation iterates over z_0, \u2026, z_k-1, leaving off z_k, \u2026, z_L-1, but the latter variables might contain some z\u2019s with lowest mutual information with x. The way the \u2018sorted\u2019 function is written only has the effect of reordering z_0, \u2026, z_{k-1} among themselves, never considering any of the z_k and above whatever their MI\u2019s are, which is probably not what the authors meant. Perhaps \u2018sorted\u2019 is intended to both sort and rename z\u2019s, but if z\u2019s are indeed renamed I think this should be indicated mathematically otherwise the equation is wrong (e.g., (z\u2019_1, \u2026, z\u2019_{L-1}) = sorted_by_MI(z_1, \u2026, z_{L_1})).\n\nTypos in WSEPIN and WINDIN definitions: \u201c0 = 1\u201d -> \u201ci = 1\u201d?\n\nFigure 1: \u201cImage\u201d? The paper is written in general terms and doesn\u2019t seem to assume otherwise x is an image representation (or does it?).\n\nSection 3.4: \u201cTable. 1\u201d -> \u201cTable 1\u201d\n\nTable 1 vs. title of Section 3.1: The author\u2019s informativeness metric doesn\u2019t have a name, but the section title contains \u201cinformativeness,\u201d which could be confusing vs. \u201cinformativeness\u201d in Table 1 which is a completely different metric.\n\nPage 8, interpretability: \u201cTC=10\u201d. Do you mean \u201cTC loss\u201d here? I presume 10 is the value of a hyperparameter of the FactorVAE paper (gamma?), and not the actual value of the TC term. Same question for Figure 9 and later figures of the appendix."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper273/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper273/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Theory and Evaluation Metrics for Learning Disentangled Representations", "authors": ["Kien Do", "Truyen Tran"], "authorids": ["dkdo@deakin.edu.au", "truyen.tran@deakin.edu.au"], "keywords": ["disentanglement", "metrics"], "abstract": "We make two theoretical contributions to disentanglement learning by (a) defining precise semantics of disentangled representations, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluation. First, we characterize the concept \u201cdisentangled representations\u201d used in supervised and unsupervised methods along three dimensions\u2013informativeness, separability and interpretability\u2013which can be expressed and quantified explicitly using information-theoretic constructs. This helps explain the behaviors of several well-known disentanglement learning models. We then propose robust metrics for measuring informativeness, separability and interpretability. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our metrics correctly characterize the representations learned by different methods and are consistent with qualitative (visual) results. Thus, the metrics allow disentanglement learning methods to be compared on a fair ground. We also empirically uncovered new interesting properties of VAE-based methods and interpreted them with our formulation. These findings are promising and hopefully will encourage the design of more theoretically driven models for learning disentangled representations.
