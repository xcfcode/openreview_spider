Similar convergence rates as signSGD were obtained, with an additional sqrt(d) factor which is typical in zero-order methods. Three (typical) gradient estimates based on function values were discussed. Overall, the obtained results are relatively straightforward combination of signSGD with existing zero-order techniques. \n\nQuality: The technical part of this paper seems to be solid. The experiments, on the other hand, are quite ambiguous. First off, why do you choose that peculiar least squares binary classification problem on page 7? Is Assumption A2 satisfied for this problem? Why not use logistic regression? The experimental results are also strange: Why would ZO-signSGD converge faster than ZO-SGD or any other ZO variant? Shouldn't they enjoy similar rates of convergence? Why would taking the sign make the algorithm converge faster? Note that the original motivation for signSGD is not for faster convergence but less communication. For the second set of experiment, how do you apply ZO-SGD to generate adversarial examples? Again, why do we expect ZO-signSGD to perform better than ZO-SGD?\n\nClarity: This paper is mostly well-written, but the authors at times largely overclaim their contributions or exaggerate the technical challenges. \n-- Page 2, 2nd line: the authors claim that \"Our analysis removes the impractical assumption of b = O(T)\", but in the later examples (page 6, top), they require q = O(T). How is this any different than b = O(T)?

Based on the reviewer\u2019s comments, our paper has been largely improved. In what follows, we clarity our main contributions and 'additional difficulties'.\n\nFirst, beyond signSGD, our established results apply to the case of mini-batch sampling without replacement. And thus, ZO-signGD can be treated as a special case in our analysis. To derive the variance of ZO gradient estimate, we require careful analysis on the effects of two types of mini-batch sampling as well as random direction sampling, and then link them with statistics of a single random gradient estimate known in the existing ZO results.\n\nSecond, to derive the eventual convergence error of ZO-signSGD, we require to fill the gap between the L1 geometry of signSGD and the variance of the ZO gradient estimate in terms of squared L2 norm. Moreover, we require to study the effects of different types of ZO gradient estimators on the convergence of ZO-signSGD. In particular, sign-based gradient estimators, (11)-(12) in Sec. 5, have not been well studied in the ZO literature. These estimators can be interpreted as the ZO counterparts of first-order gradient estimators with majority vote in the centralized and distributed settings.\n\nLast but not the least, our goal is not to 'combine' ZO and signSGD. As a matter of fact, ZO-signSGD has been well motivated in the design of black-box adversarial examples (Ilyas et al., 2018a). However, the formal connection between optimization theory and adversarial ML was not fully established. Our work provides a comprehensive study on ZO-signSGD from multiple perspectives including convergence analysis, gradient estimator, and applications. We really hope that the reviewer can recognize the contributions of this work in both theory and practice. \n\n\nQ: The technical part of this paper seems to be solid. The experiments, on the other hand, are quite ambiguous. First off, why do you choose that peculiar least squares binary classification problem on page 7? Is Assumption A2 satisfied for this problem? Why not use logistic regression? \n\nR: The least squared formulation is commonly used for nonconvex machine learning (Xue et al. 2017), given the fact that the standard logistic regression yields a convex problem. Since we study ZO-signSGD in the nonconvex setting, we choose to solve the least squared binary classification problem in order to make empirical studies consistent with theory. And Assumption A2 is indeed satisfied for the proposed problem. This is not difficult to prove by the boundedness of the sigmoid function. We have clarified this point in Sec. 6.\n\nP. Xu, F.

About the original last two technical challenges, we would like to emphasize the following points.\n \nFirst, it is not trivial to overcome the second technical challenge, since we need to carefully investigate the effect of two mini-batch sampling schemes as well as the effect of random direction sampling on the variance of ZO gradient estimates (see Proposition 2). In particular, the use of mini-batch samples without replacement removes the assumption of i.i.d. samples. This challenge does not go away immediately even if we replace f by f_mu. \n\nSecond, in the last technical challenge, we aimed to emphasize that both the sign operation and the ZO random gradient estimation are biased approximations to the true gradient. Note that the sign-based descent algorithm measures the convergence in L1 geometry, which introduces a mismatch with the squared L2  norm used in bounding the variance of ZO gradient estimates. In addition to relating f_mu with f, we need to translate the gradient norm from L1 to L2 and use the probabilistic convergence method to derive the eventual convergence error bound (see Theorem 1).\n\n\nQ: Significance: The proposed zero-order version of signSGD may potentially be significant in applications where gradient information is not available and yet distributed optimization is needed. This, however, is not demonstrated in the paper as the authors never considered distributed optimization.\n\n\nR: We agree with the reviewer that distributed optimization is an interesting setting to perform ZOsignSGD. However, even in the centralizing setting, ZO (gradient-free) methods are also attractive when the gradient is difficult or impossible to compute. For ZO-signSGD, we have shown in Sec. 3 and Sec. 6 that it is well motivated by centralization optimization problems, e.g., the design of black-box adversarial examples under limited queries.\n\nTo further address the reviewer\u2019s concern, we have also added a new sign-based gradient estimator (12) used for ZO distributed optimization. This results in a distributed variant of ZO-signSGD, whose convergence rate is derived in Corollary 3 and empirical performance is compared with other variants of ZO-signSGD in Figure 2. We refer the reviewer to Sec. 5 for more details.\n\nHopefully, the reviewer agrees with us that our new version has been largely improved, and could re-evaluate our work towards a better score.

We answer the reviewer\u2019s specific questions as below. \n\n\nQ: -- Page 2, 2nd line: the authors claim that \"Our analysis removes the impractical assumption of b = O(T)\", but in the later examples (page 6, top), they require q = O(T). How is this any different than b = O(T)? Even worse, the former case also require b = n, i.e., there is no stochasity at all\u2026\n\nR: We apologize for the confusion we made in the initial version. Here the \u2019impractical assumption b = O(T)\u2019 meant the assumption of i.i.d. mini-batch samples (with replacement) used in signSGD (Bernstein et al. 2018). Based on such an assumption, signSGD in (Bernstein et al. 2018) cannot cover signGD as a special case since the mini-batch of size b = n might NOT be equivalent to the entire set [n]. By contrast, our convergence analysis for ZO-signSGD applies to both mini-batch sampling schemes with and without replacement. The use of mini-batch sampling without replacement makes ZO-signSGD equivalent to ZO-signGD at b = n. \n\nDifferent from the mini-batch b, the number of random directions q is introduced by ZO gradient estimation. Compared to signSGD, ZO-signSGD involves an additional convergence error relying on d and q. This is the cost of gradient-free optimization methods using function difference based gradient estimates. The choice of making q proportional to d (or T) is commonly used in ZO methods (Duchi et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2018; Hajinezhad et al. 2017) to reduce the variance of ZO gradient estimates.

We wanted to emphasize that ZO-signSGD allows mini-batch sampling without replacement. The error term \\sqrt(d/b) can be eliminated as b = n and when the mini-batch sampling without replacement is used. However, this is not true while using i.i.d. mini-batch samples (even if b = n). In general, the error term \\sqrt(d/b) exists, which is induced by the variance of gradient estimates.

Shouldn't they enjoy similar rates of convergence? Why would taking the sign make the algorithm converge faster? Note that the original motivation for signSGD is not for faster convergence but less communication. For the second set of experiment, how do you apply ZO-SGD to generate adversarial examples? Again, why do we expect ZO-signSGD to perform better than ZO-SGD?\n\nR: Based on the reviewer\u2019s comment, we realize that our explanation on the possible fast convergence of ZO-signSGD is not enough. \n\nFirst, the original motivation for signSGD is for both fast communication and fast convergence; see abstract, Sec. 3 and Figure A1 in (Bernstein et al., 2018). Thus, the motivation of signSGD is not limited to the fact that it can significantly reduce communication overhead. \n\nSecond, it is not strange that ZO-signSGD could converge faster to at least moderate accuracy than ZO-SGD and other ZO variants. Our work, the previous work on signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018), and many other white-box and black-box adversarial example generation methods (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018; Ilyas et al., 2018a) have shown that taking the sign could make the algorithm converge faster. We have added a subsection \u2018Motivations of ZO-signSGD\u2019 in Sec. 3 to provide rationale about why the sign operation could be beneficial to fast convergence. We repeat our discussion as below.\n\n\u201cCompared to SGD-type methods, the fast empirical convergence of signSGD and ZO-signSGD has been shown in the application of generating white-box and black-box adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018; Ilyas et al., 2018a). As mentioned in (Bernstein et al., 2018), the sign operation could mitigate the negative effect of (coordinate-wise) gradient noise of large variance. Recall that the ZO gradient estimate is a biased approximation to the true gradient, and thus, could suffer larger noise variance than (first-order) stochastic gradients. In this context, one could benefit from ZO-signSGD due to its robustness to gradient noise. In Appendix 1, we provide two concrete examples (Fig. A1 and Fig. A2) to confirm the aforementioned analysis. In Fig. A1, we show the robustness of ZO-signSGD against sparse noise perturbation through a toy quadratic optimization problem, first introduced by (Bernstein et al., 2018). In Fig. A2, we show that gradient estimation via ZO oracle indeed encounters gradient noise of large variance. Thus, taking the sign of a gradient estimate might scale down the extremely noisy components.\u201d\n\nThird, both our empirical results and theoretical results confirm that ZO-signSGD converge faster than ZO-SGD to moderate accuracy. In theory,  the convergence rate of ZO-signSGD is measured through the L2 norm | \\nabla f(x_R) |_2  rather than its squared counterpart | \\nabla f(x_R) |_2^2, where the latter was used to evaluate the convergence of ZO-SGD. We recall from (Ghadimi & Lan, 2013, Theorem 3.2 & Corollary 3.3) that ZO-SGD yields the convergence error E [ | \\nabla f(x_R) |_2^2 ] \\leq O(\\sqrt{d}/\\sqrt{T}).  Since  | \\nabla f(x_R) |_2^2 \\leq | \\nabla f(x_R) |_2 as it converges, the established rate of ZO-signSGD meets a stricter convergence criterion than that of ZO-SGD. Thus, ZO-signSGD can converge faster (than ZO-SGD) to moderate accuracy, e.g., a neighborhood of a stationary point, where the size of the neighborhood is controlled by the mini-batch size b and the number of random direction vectors q. The application of black-box adversarial attack further shows that the fast convergence of ZO-signSGD to the first successful adversarial attack significantly saves the cost of function queries. We also show the superior performance of ZO-signSGD to a benchmark black-box attack generation method. We refer the reviewer to Sec. 6 for more details.\n\n Ilyas, L. Engstrom, A. Athalye, and J.

We provide the detailed response to each comment as below.\n\nQ: 1) out of curiosity, can we improve the convergence rate of the zeroth-order sign SGD if we assume the mini-batch size is of order O(T)? This could help us better compare zeroth-order sign SGD and sign SGD.\n\nR: Yes, the large mini-batch size of b = O(T) indeed improves the convergence rate of ZO-signSGD. As b = O(T), the convergence rate given in (9) becomes O(\\sqrt{d}/\\sqrt{T} + \\alpha_b \\sqrt{d}/\\sqrt{T} + d/\\sqrt{Tq}), where the last error term O(d/\\sqrt{Tq}) is induced by ZO gradient estimation error. In order to further improve the rate to O(\\sqrt{d}/\\sqrt{T}), it is required to make the number of random direction samples $q$ proportional to $d$. Similar to other ZO methods (Liu et al. 2018; Hajinezhad et al. 2017), the large q helps to reduce the variance of ZO gradient estimates. \n\nOn the other hand,  the assumption of b = O(T) might not be necessary if n < O(T), where n is the total number of individual cost functions. Suppose that b = n and we use mini-batch sampling without replacement, then ZO-signSGD becomes ZO-signGD. This leads to the convergence rate O(\\sqrt{d}/\\sqrt{T} + d/\\sqrt{nq}). In this case, we can improve the rate to recover O(\\sqrt{d}/\\sqrt{T}) by only setting the number of random direction vectors induced by ZO gradient estimation, $q = O(dT/n)$. It is worth mentioning that such an improvement  cannot be achieved by ZO-signSGD using mini-batch with replacement even if b = n with the same setting of q. We refer reviewer to our detailed analysis in the last paragraph of Sec. 4.\n\nS. Liu, et al., Zeroth-order stochastic variance reduction for nonconvex optimization, NIPS, 2018\nD. Hajinezhad, et al., \u201cZeroth order nonconvex multi-agent optimization over networks,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.09997, 2017.\n\n\nQ: 2) Figure 2 is too small to be legible. Also, it seems that the adversarial examples generated by zeroth-order sign SGD have higher distortion than those found by zeroth-order SGD on CIFAR-10 dataset. Is it true? If so, it would be beneficial to have a qualitative explanation of such behavior.\n\nR: We have enlarged Figure 2. Yes, Given the first successful adversarial example, we observe that ZO-signSGD yields slightly higher L2 distortion than ZO-SGD. This is not surprising since compared to ZO-SGD, the convergence rate of ZO-signSGD involves an additional error correction term (relying on b and q in (9)). Accordingly, ZO-signSGD might converge to moderate accuracy (e.g., a solution neighborhood) rather than a very high accuracy. However, the convergence of ZO-signSGD to moderate accuracy could be much faster than ZO-SGD since the former meets a stricter convergence criterion (L2 norm of gradient) than that of ZO-SGD (squared L2 norm of gradient). We refer the reviewer to the paragraph after Eq. (9) for more discussions. \n\nIn the example of generating black-box adversarial attacks, compared to convergence accuracy (in terms of attack distortion), the effectiveness of a black-box attack is measured by the number of function queries needed to achieve the first successful adversarial attack. Thus, ZO-signSGD is desired in this application due to its fast convergence to moderate accuracy. To further confirm this point, in Sec. 6 we have added an experiment to compare ZO-signSGD with a benchmark black-box attack generation method in (Ilyas et al., 2018a). Indeed, ZO-signSGD offers fast convergence to the first successful adversarial attack under limited queries.\n\nA. Ilyas, et al., Black-box adversarial attacks with limited queries and information.

Particularly, two concrete motivating examples (Appendix 1) are presented to motivate how ZO-signSGD could outperform ZO-SGD.

We would like to point out that sign-based gradient estimators, e.g., (11)-(12) in Sec. 5, have not been well studied in the ZO literature. These estimators can be interpreted as the ZO counterparts of first-order gradient estimators with majority vote in the centralized and distributed settings, respectively. Here the ZO gradient estimator (12) is newly introduced for ZO distributed optimization. Even the gradient estimators (3) and (10) were used by existing ZO methods, how they affect the convergence of ZO-signSGD has not been well studied. Due to their popularity in designing black-box adversarial examples (Ilyas et al., 2018a), it is important to rigorously analyze the effect of standard gradient estimators on ZO-signSGD, in order to characterize their limitations or possible improvements.\n\nRefs: A.

Our paper has been greatly improved based on these comments. The major modifications are summarized as below.\n\na) In Sec. 3, we have added the subsection \u2018Motivations of ZO-signSGD\u2019 to demonstrate the possible advantages of ZO-signSGD from a high-level point of view. We then presented two concrete examples (Fig. A1 and Fig. A2) to support our intuition prior to the rigorous study on the convergence rate of ZO-signSGD.\n\nb) In Sec. 5, we have added a new sign-based gradient estimator for ZO distributed optimization. This leads to a new variant of ZO-signSGD, whose convergence rate is illustrated in Corollary 3.\n\nc) In Sec. 6, we have added Figure 2 to show the empirical performance of different variants of ZO-signSGD (including the new one used for ZO distributed optimization). Moreover, we compare our approach with a benchmark black-box adversarial attack method (Ilyas et al., 2018a). The new empirical results show that ZO-signSGD outperforms the benchmark in terms of both query efficiency and attack distortion.\n\nd) Throughout the paper, we have tried our best to address reviewers\u2019 comments and to make our presentation as clear as possible. \n\nA.

Sign SGD is commonly used in adversarial example generation. Compared to sign SGD, zeroth-order sign SGD does not require the knowledge of the magnitude of the gradient, which makes it suitable to optimize black-box systems. The authors studied the convergence rate of zeroth-order sign SGD, and showed that under common assumptions, zero-order sign SGD achieves O(sqrt(d/T)) convergence rate, which is slower than sign SGD by a factor of sqrt(d). However, sign SGD requires an unrealisitcally large mini-batch size, which zeroth-order sign SGD does not. The authors demonstrated the performance of zeroth-order sign SGD in numerical experiments.\n\nOverall, this is a well written paper. The convergence property of the zeroth-order sign SGD is sufficiently studied. The proposal seems to be useful in real world tasks.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1) out of curiosity, can we improve the convergence rate of the zeroth-order sign SGD if we assume the mini-batch size is of order O(T)? This could help us better compare zeroth-order sign SGD and sign SGD.\n2) Figure 2 is too small to be legible.
