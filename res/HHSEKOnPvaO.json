Our responses to the questions are below.\n\n* **Edge Importance in Graph Regularization**. For simplicity, we treat the edges in Equation 7 the same way. However, the cross-entropy loss that we use to penalize deviations from learned edges does account for edge importance to some extent. Given a previously learned edge $\\text{Ber}(p)$ and its current representation $\\text{Ber}(q)$, the cross-entropy loss is $H(p, q) = -p \\log(q) - (1-p) \\log(1 - q)$, which is an increasing function of $p$ when $q \\leq 0.5$. As a result, if the model returns the same probability $q \\leq 0.5$ for some edges, the edge with the smallest learned probability contributes the least to the regularization term (the reverse is true when $q \\geq 0.5$). Conceivably, the model tends to learn sharp edges (those with $p$ far away from $0.5$), which agrees with our empirical observation that a sparse context graph $\\mathbf{G}$ results in better accuracy.\n\n* **Higher-Order Graph Structures**. In this paper, we only consider pairwise connections between samples in the form of adjacency matrices. It would be a really interesting direction to model and learn higher-order relationships (e.g. triples, quadruples, etc.) as suggested by the reviewer. We think that such learned structures would provide further signals for sample selection strategies, which can be effective against catastrophic forgetting as demonstrated by previous work [1, 2].\n\n1.

Our responses to the questions are below.\n\n* **Comparison to Regularization Models**. In the paper, we did compare our model with EWC, one of the most popular regularization approaches. Here, we also compare it with VCL[1] based on [its authors\u2019 public repository](https://github.com/nvcuong/variational-continual-learning). As shown in previous work [2], regularization techniques such as EWC or VCL are not very effective in single-pass settings.\n\n    $$\\\\begin{array} {|l|c|c|}\\\\hline  \\text{Dataset} & \\text{Permuted MNIST} & \\text{Rotated MNIST} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\text{EWC} & 64.94 \\pm 1.22 & 44.99 \\pm 1.73 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline  \\text{VCL} & 64.50 \\pm 1.78 & 49.13 \\pm 1.33 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline   \\textbf{GCL} & \\textbf{82.36} \\pm 0.36 & \\textbf{86.37} \\pm 0.32 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{array} $$\n\n* **Comparison to Other Baselines**.  We appreciate the recent studies pointed out by the reviewer and have updated our related work section to include these ones. While these models are impressive, we emphasize that they are not directly comparable to our approach and often assume unlimited access to datasets [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] or pre-trained feature extractors [6]. In contrast, we focus on single-epoch settings where each task is experienced only once, following [9, 10, 11, 12]. As discussed in the paper and argued in previous work, such settings are much more challenging and are designed to expose catastrophic forgetting. For example, a naive MLP trained continuously on Rotated MNIST (denoted by *Finetune* in the paper) can significantly increase average accuracy from $43.80$ after the first epoch to $62.42$ after 5 epochs to $80.99$ after 20 epochs.\n\n\n1.

For $\\lambda_{\\text{C}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\text{T}}$ (see Equation 8 for their definitions), we simply set both of them to $1.0$, effectively weighting old samples and new samples equally. As mentioned in the paper, we use a small temperature for $\\mathbf{G}$ (e.g. $\\tau_{\\mathbf{G}} = 1.0$)  and a larger temperature for $\\mathbf{A}$ (e.g. $\\tau_{\\mathbf{A}} = 5.0$) to avoid spurious edges within the context graph and encourage more sample-to-sample association at test time. We show the effects of $\\lambda_{\\mathbf{G}}$ in Figure 6 to demonstrate that including graph regularization is particularly helpful to our model performance. Please see Appendix G for more details about the hyper-parameters.\n\n* **Number of Graph Samples**. The following table shows the effects of the number of graph samples $\\mathbf{A}$ on the accuracy of our model on Split CIFAR10. Even with a single graph sample, our model performs relatively well compared to ER ($44.38 \\%$ vs $29.94\\%$). As the number of graph sample increases, the classification performance gets better at a diminishing rate. We find that 30 samples work quite well without incurring too much overhead at test time.\n\n    $$\\\\begin{array} {|l|c|c|c|c|}\\\\hline  \\\\text{Graph Samples} & 1 & 10 & \\\\textbf{30} & 50 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\text{Accuracy (ACC)} & 44.38 \\\\pm 1.25 & 46.69 \\\\pm 1.78 & \\\\textbf{49.62} \\\\pm 1.85 & 49.67 \\\\pm 1.44\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline  \\\\end{array}$$"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper536/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper536/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph-Based Continual Learning", "authorids": ["~Binh_Tang1", "~David_S._Matteson1"], "authors": ["Binh Tang", "David S.

The idea is well-formulated, and carried out in a sound way. The graph regularization term resembles the knowledge-distillation, as the authors also mentioned, but it serves different purpose of preserving the covariance structure of the outputs of the image encoders. \n\nThe experimental results look quite strong and the ablation study also looks sound. Overall, I find the paper quite strong. \n\nCon & Questions:\n\n- It seems like there are 4 hyperparameters: \"temperature\" for the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and 3 lambdas. Fig 6 shows the effects of $\\lambda_G$, but what about others? How sensitive is the performance with respect to other hyperparamters? Since the problem setting is a single-pass setting, how are the hyperparameters selected?\n\n- The inference time is a bit longer (not too much than others) since the algorithm has to sample graphs 30 times. What happens if the number of samples is less than 30 so that the inference time becomes similar to ER? Would the performance degrade significantly?

Rehearsal approaches alleviate the problem by maintaining and replaying a small episodic memory of previous samples, often implemented as an array of independent memory slots. In this work, we propose to augment such an array with a learnable random graph that captures pairwise similarities between its samples, and use it not only to learn new tasks but also to guard against forgetting. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets show that our model consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for task-free continual learning.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "tang|graphbased_continual_learning", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/7e4494ef4e463d64bf626f99de8c1fcaf4816d2c.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/39a91d5348ba8489817ac3ee4a93637e12b23c4b.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ntang2021graphbased,\ntitle={Graph-Based Continual Learning},\nauthor={Binh Tang and David S.
