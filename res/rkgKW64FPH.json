Overall it is a solid and well-written article.\u00a0\n2. The interesting and novel part is the theoretical demonstration that a fixed number of neighbors can approximate well some algorithms in the literature (it approximates well w.r.t to the forward embedding produced by those algorithms and to the backward gradients in relation to the parameters),\u00a0\n3.It also demonstrates that some algorithms are impossible to approximate in constant time.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. They do not introduce a new method, the algorithm is message-passing in which not all the neighbors are considered - authors choose a fixed number of neighbors by sampling. This gives them constant time for the calculation of the embedding w.r.t to the number of neighbors\n\nMain points:\n\nOverall, the article is well supported theoretically and quite complete. They generally show that if the assumptions made are contradicted, the approximation becomes impossible.\n\nThe experiments seem quite well chosen for the cases studied. In general, the experiments in which authors want to show the impossibility of an approximation, are done exactly on the corner cases chosen for the theoretical demonstrations. However,\u00a0 they also have experiments on real datasets, used in the literature.\n\nOther observations:\n\nIt is not very clear what do they mean by \"standardization layer from GCN\" which intervenes in several theorems.\n\nIt may have been good to show how accuracy varies relative to the chosen error. It is not very intuitive what an embedding approximation error of e = 0.01 means. For example, to have 0.1 error and 95% confidence I would have to choose 300 neighbors.... That seems to be a very large number, how practical is that?\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper384/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper384/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["r.sato@ml.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "myamada@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "kashima@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp"], "title": "Constant Time Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Ryoma Sato", "Makoto Yamada", "Hisashi Kashima"], "pdf": "/pdf/7203c3765d3ac671867d1b9474ca08dac3899f48.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approximation algorithm of GNNs that works in constant time with respect to the input size.", "abstract": "The recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to state-of-the-art performances in various applications, including chemo-informatics, question-answering systems, and recommender systems.

The proposed method is exactly the uniform neighbor sampling methods. There is little contribution on the methodology side from the paper. Also, it would be interesting if the authors could provide theoretical analysis for adaptive sampling methods as well.\n\nOur problem setting is general, and we do not make any assumptions about the input graph. Therefore, in this setting, non-uniform sampling does not work because we allow adversarial inputs. This is supported by Theorem 3, which shows that the uniform sampling scheme is optimal in terms of query complexity. This is common with Hayashi and Yoshida\u2019s constant time algorithms for minimizing quadratic functions [Hayashi and Yoshida, NIPS 2016] and fitting low-rank tensors [Hayashi and Yoshida, NIPS 2017], where they succeeded in providing constant time algorithms using uniform sampling. If we make task-specific assumptions about the input graph/features (e.g., the input graph is sampled from the stochastic block model, and the features are sampled from i.i.d. distribution in each cluster), adaptive sampling techniques may work.\n\nIn this paper, we do not consider such task-specific assumptions but use a general and widely-applicable setting because the task-specific assumptions are in general strong and narrow the score of application. This is the first work to analyze the theoretical approximation errors of node sampling, and many other task-specific analysis can stem from this work. Note that if we sample nodes without replacement, the approximation error may decrease in practice, but the theoretical rate does not change.\n\n\n> 4. The authors provide in-approximability results under certain conditionals. However, uniform sampling methods works well empirically under this case as well. It would be better if the authors could explain the gap between theory and empirical performance.\n\nThe reasons why uniform sampling also succeeds in inapproximable settings are two-fold. The first reason is that the input graphs/features have nice properties in some cases (e.g., the input graph is sampled from the stochastic block model.) The second reason is that one uses more samples as the size of input graphs increases. We prove that some models cannot be approximated by a constant number of samples, but such networks may be approximated by, say, linear number of samples with respect to the input size. Our experiments support this fact. The number of samples is usually determined using validation data (e.g., cross-validation) in practice. So one may use more samples implicitly when the input data are large and dense. Our theory provides theoretical justification for determining the number of samples beforehand for various situations.\n\n\n> 1.

Though the bounds do not depend on number of nodes, it does have an exponential dependence on the number of layers. For common GCN with L=2, even \\epsilon = 0.1 requires more than 10^4 samples. As a result, the bound is less practical in providing guidance for real-world application.\n\nOur analysis is sometimes looser than the errors in empirical cases because we consider the worst case with mild assumptions.\n\nThis is common with PAC learning literature and many other constant time algorithms. For example, the query complexities of Nguyen and Onak's constant time algorithms for the maximum matching problem and the minimum dominating set problem depend on $O((1/\\varepsilon)^{2^k})$ ($\\varepsilon$ is the approximation error, and $k$ is the maximum degree of input graphs) [Nguyen and Onak, FOCS 2008], which is extremely large in practice, whereas the approximation algorithms work far more efficiently than this bound in practice. However, their theoretical bounds are nonetheless informative because the assumptions are general, and these bounds are constants with respect to the number of nodes and edges. The usefulness of their theoretical results has been proved by many other works following this work.\n\nThe tightness of theoretical error bound and generality is in a trade-off relation. If one wants to obtain tighter bound, one should make more assumptions that are characteristic of the problem. For example, if one assumes that the model architecture is GraphSAGE-mean, the input graph is sampled from the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, and the node features are sampled from i.i.d. Gaussian distribution, in addition to Assumptions 1 to 5, then the error bound does not depend on the number of layers by trivial discussion because what we only have to estimate is the parameters of the Gaussian distribution. (They are strong assumptions, and the empirical situations are usually placed between it and our assumptions.)\n\nWe analyze general cases by imposing mild assumptions in this paper because this is the first work discussing the theoretical approximation errors of node sampling. As AnonReviewer1 pointed out, our analysis provides an interesting understanding of an approach that is commonly used in practice, and we consider our work is useful for further analysis for more specific situations to obtain tighter bounds.\n\n> the bound does not depend on the embedding dimension\n\nIn this paper, we fix the architecture of the model structure, as we mention in the problem formulation section, and we treat the dimensions of intermediate embeddings and final embeddings as a constant. As our proofs in the appendix shows, the error bounds depend quasi linearly on the final embedding dimension.\n\n\n> 2. The authors only provide constant bound for convolution on individual nodes. For the final metrics like classification accuracy, we need to guarantee good approximation for all node\u2019s convolution. In this case, the bounds will definitely depend on number of nodes at least through the union bounds among all nodes.\n\nExactly. It should be noted that the inference for a single node is also useful in the online setting, as we noted in the footnote of the introduction because the delay of the response of the inference for a single node matters in this case.\n\nIf one needs to obtain a good approximation for all nodes, the computational complexity depends on the number of nodes. This is necessary because the output size itself depends on the number of nodes. Note that even in this case, the dependency of our analysis to the input size is optimal. Especially, the complexity does not depend on the number of edges, whereas exact computation requires at least |E| operations, which is computationally heavy if the input graph is dense.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper384/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper384/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["r.sato@ml.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "myamada@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "kashima@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp"], "title": "Constant Time Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Ryoma Sato", "Makoto Yamada", "Hisashi Kashima"], "pdf": "/pdf/7203c3765d3ac671867d1b9474ca08dac3899f48.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approximation algorithm of GNNs that works in constant time with respect to the input size.", "abstract": "The recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to state-of-the-art performances in various applications, including chemo-informatics, question-answering systems, and recommender systems.

In particular, they prove several PAC learning-style bounds on the embedding and gradient estimation when using node sampling approaches. They also observe that since the number of nodes selected for sampling is not dependent on the size of the graph, this amounts to a constant time operation for determining embedding and gradient estimates.\n\nImportantly, a variety of existing works have already proposed node sampling (\u201cconstant-time GNNs\u201d), so the contribution of this work lies in the theoretical bounds. A moderate set of experiments suggests the empirical behavior follows the theoretical expectations.\n\nOverall (and described in the comments below), I believe this paper provides some interesting theoretical results for an approach that is widely-used in practice. However, I believe the title and abstract are misleading; this paper does not suggest some new sampling strategy; it only gives a theoretical approximation error for existing approaches and network architectures.\n\nComments\n\nWhile the authors do make this clear later in the paper, the contributions of this work are only the theoretical bounds; the node sampling algorithms have been proposed in existing work. Both the title and abstract are misleading.\n\nStill, the theoretical bounds do provide an interesting understanding of an approach which is commonly used in practice.\n\nIt would be helpful to give the intuition behind the assumptions and proofs. Currently, it is difficult for a non-expert to follow the reasoning and practical implications of much of this work.\n\nCurrently, it is not clear if these results are \u201cconstructive\u201d, in the sense that they do not obviously suggest some new sampling strategy, etc. Of course, it is still interesting to characterize commonly-used practices, but one does wish the theory suggested, say, a better sampling strategy, etc.\n\nTypos, etc.\n\n\u201cr\u201d, the number of sampled nodes, is not defined in the main body of the paper.\n\nThe text in Footnote 1 is a little confusing, in that the text refers to approximating the embedding, while the text in the footnote describes a prediction problem. A reader could easily interpret this to mean that the error on the downstream prediction problem will be bounded (which is not what this work shows).\n\nThe text mentions that O_G (v,i) refers to the i^th \u201cneighborhood\u201d of v. Presumably, this should be \u201cneighbor\u201d.\n\n\u201cwe take\u201d -> \u201cWe take\u201d\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper384/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper384/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["r.sato@ml.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "myamada@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp", "kashima@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp"], "title": "Constant Time Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Ryoma Sato", "Makoto Yamada", "Hisashi Kashima"], "pdf": "/pdf/7203c3765d3ac671867d1b9474ca08dac3899f48.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose an approximation algorithm of GNNs that works in constant time with respect to the input size.", "abstract": "The recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to state-of-the-art performances in various applications, including chemo-informatics, question-answering systems, and recommender systems. However, scaling up these methods to huge graphs such as social network graphs and web graphs still remains a challenge. In particular, the existing methods for accelerating GNNs are either not theoretically guaranteed in terms of approximation error, or they require at least a linear time computation cost. \nIn this study, we analyze the neighbor sampling technique to obtain a constant time approximation algorithm for GraphSAGE, the graph attention networks (GAT), and the graph convolutional networks (GCN). The proposed approximation algorithm can theoretically guarantee the precision of approximation. The key advantage of the proposed approximation algorithm is that the complexity is completely independent of the numbers of the nodes, edges, and neighbors of the input and depends only on the error tolerance and confidence probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first constant time approximation algorithm for GNNs with a theoretical guarantee.
