We would like to clarify our contributions in this work: \n\nThis paper focuses on the efficient calculation of negative curvature direction. The contributions are two-folds: 1) a quantum algorithm to generate the target state which corresponds to the negative curvature direction, and 2) an efficient read-out algorithm to provide a classical description for the target state. \nThe quantum SVE model is used for performing the quantum singular value decomposition. However, only using the quantum SVE is not enough to achieve quantum advantage because the obtained singular value does not carry the sign information, and the further read-out of the target state is another bottleneck for both this work and other quantum ML models which output state as the solution. Besides using the quantum SVE model, it is critical for us to develop several subroutines for the proposed task, for example, the PNED algorithm (Algorithm 4 in Appendix) for discriminating the sign of eigenvalue. We also develop the Complete Basis Selection Algorithm in the read-out part which aims to select a linearly independent basis from d columns in order to form the column space. Both of these are important yet non-trivial development for the proposed task.\n\nBelow are some responses to the reviewer\u2019s concern:\n\nRE_1: The authors don't compare this method with any existing work in quantum singular value transformation and decomposition.\n\nAS_1: We have added notes about the quantum algorithms for the related linear algebra problems in the revision. There are some proposed quantum algorithms for problems in the related linear algebra field. For example, given copies to quantum state $\\rho=\\sum_{i,j=1}^d x_{ij} |i\\rangle\\langle j|$, where $x_{ij}$ is the $i,j$-th element of $d \\times d$ matrix $X$ with eigen-decomposition $X=\\sum_{i=1}^{rank(X)} \\lambda_i  {u}_i  {u}_i$, previous quantum PCA algorithm [1] could perform the mapping $\\sum_j \\beta_j | {u}_j\\rangle \\rightarrow \\sum_j \\beta_j | {u}_j\\rangle |\\tilde{\\lambda}_j\\rangle$ in time $O(polylog(d)\\epsilon^{-3})$, which implies one sort of quantum SVD. However, the quantum PCA model use the density matrix $\\rho$ to store the information of concerned matrix $X$, which implicitly assumes conditions $\\|X\\|_F=1$ and $\\lambda_{\\min}(X) \\ge 0$. Another quantum SVD algorithm [2] shows an efficient method to estimate the value $\\lambda_j /d$ with error $\\epsilon$ in time $O(\\epsilon^{-3})$, for $d \\times d$ matrix $X$ with eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^d$. However, this model only suits the case when $\\lambda_j/d$ is relatively large, and it would take time $O(d^3 \\epsilon^{-3})$ to produce $\\epsilon$-estimation on eigenvalues.\nMoreover, both methods do not study the classical read-out of the output state, which generally takes time at least $O(d)$ for $d$-dimensional state, offsetting the claimed quantum speed-up [3]. It is thus critical to design fast read-out algorithms to achieve quantum advantage for the whole task, which is usually challenging.\n\nRE_2: Despite the title, I can't find a strong connection between the proposed algorithm and machine learning. \n\nAS_2: This work presents a quantum algorithm for finding the negative curvature direction, which is often used in many second-order algorithms for non-convex optimization. Since current deep learning models are highly non-convex, our algorithm is valuable.\n\nRE_3: Given a loss function f and the parameters x, the paper doesn't specify how to construct the quantum state in the step 2 of Algorithm 2. Is there a cheap way to construct the quantum state from (f, x)? \n\nAS_3: We place the construction of state in the step 2 of Algorithm 2 in Appendix (A. 4) due to the limit of page length. Specifically, the quantum state could be prepared by applying oracles V_H and U_H on the initial $|0\\rangle|0\\rangle$ state, each for one time:\n\n$|0\\rangle|0\\rangle \\stackrel{V_H}{\\longrightarrow} \\frac{1}{\\| {H}\\|_F} \\sum_{i=1}^d\\| {h}_i\\||i\\rangle|0\\rangle \\stackrel{U_H}{\\longrightarrow} \\frac{1}{\\| {H}\\|_F} \\sum_{i=1}^d \\sum_{j=1}^d h_{ij} |i\\rangle|j\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\| {H}\\|_F}\\sum_{k=1}^{r} \\lambda_k | {u}_k\\rangle | {u}_k\\rangle$.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1263/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1263/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["kzha3670@uni.sydney.edu.au", "min-hsiu.hsieh@uts.edu.au", "liu.liu1@sydney.edu.au", "dacheng.tao@sydney.edu.au"], "title": "Quantum algorithm for finding the negative curvature direction", "authors": ["Kaining Zhang", "Min-Hsiu Hsieh", "Liu Liu", "Dacheng Tao"], "pdf": "/pdf/16d1b232c8e39c4690f0a24c456383db093e4caf.pdf", "TL;DR": "We present an efficient quantum algorithm aiming to find the negative curvature direction.", "abstract": "We present an efficient quantum algorithm aiming to find the negative curvature direction for escaping the saddle point, which is a critical subroutine for many second-order non-convex optimization algorithms.

We would like to clarify our contributions: \n\nThis paper focuses on the efficient calculation of negative curvature direction. The contributions are two-folds: 1) a quantum algorithm to generate the target state which corresponds to the negative curvature direction, and 2) an efficient read-out algorithm to provide a classical description for the target state. \nThe quantum SVE model is used for performing the quantum singular value decomposition. However, only using the quantum SVE is not enough to achieve quantum advantage because the obtained singular value does not carry the sign information, and the further read-out of the target state is another bottleneck for both this work and other quantum ML models which output state as the solution. Besides using the quantum SVE model, it is critical for us to develop several subroutines for the proposed task, for example, the PNED algorithm (Algorithm 4 in Appendix) for discriminating the sign of eigenvalue. We also develop the Complete Basis Selection Algorithm in the read-out part which aims to select a linearly independent basis from d columns in order to form the column space. Both of these are important yet non-trivial development for the proposed task.\n\nBelow are some responses to the reviewer\u2019s concern:\n\nRE_1: The operation `\\propto` (latex) is never explained. My understanding is that it is the update of a quantum state?\n\nAS_1: Thanks and revised.\n\nRE_2: I could not find definition of T_H anywhere.\n\nAS_2: Thanks.

The quantum negative curvature finding algorithm is exponentially faster than any known classical method which takes time at least O(d\u03b5^(\u22121/2)). Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to achieve the classical read-out of the target state.
