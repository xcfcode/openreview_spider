We were pleased to see that the reviewers found the paper \u201cclearly motivated and easy to follow\u201d (R2) and that \u201coverall it is a well executed paper\u201d (R3). \n\nThe main issue the reviewers had with this work is primarily that we do not propose any new algorithms, but rather evaluate whether the lottery ticket hypothesis is present in two domains which are substantially different from supervised image classification: RL and NLP. \n\nWhile we readily acknowledge that our paper does not make an algorithmic contribution, and while novel algorithms are clearly important, we argue that careful and rigorous empirical work to better understand the benefits and limitations of deep learning phenomena (such as the lottery ticket hypothesis) are equally important. Over the last several years, rigorous empirical work has been increasingly sought after in the community, as demonstrated by a number of recent workshops and talks which emphasize this style of work [1-3]. Furthermore, a number of careful empirical studies without algorithmic contributions have been honored recently at ICLR and other conferences with best paper awards [4-5]. \n\nGiven the impact of the original lottery ticket hypothesis paper [6] (as a rough estimate, it appears by searching on openreview, there are at least 20 submissions to ICLR 2020 related to the lottery ticket hypothesis), we would argue that clearly establishing the robustness of this phenomenon to different learning paradigms and architectures is a valuable and impactful contribution. To this end, we endeavored to evaluate this hypothesis in a diverse set of experiments, including recurrent LSTMs, Transformers, classic control tasks, and Atari tasks. We also performed a detailed set of ablation studies for all of these domains, demonstrating the importance of iterative pruning and rewinding to the discovery of high performance winning tickets. \n\nWe strongly disagree with R1\u2019s comment that \u201cthe similarity between supervised learning and RL and NLP problem is obvious from a function approximation and optimization point of view\u201d. Note that even in image classification, VGG and ResNet behaves very differently (e.g., Compared to ResNet, VGG is more over-parameterized and more weights can be pruned without affecting performance [8]). The difference is even larger between supervised learning and RL. [9] shows that even with a perfect representation of the state (and thus a good function approximator is easy to construct), it might still take an exponential number of trajectories for an agent to learn good policies. [11] shows that a nonlinear function approximation is still needed for RL to converge to the best solution in the linear function class. And [12] shows that even if the final strategy is linear, a nonlinear function is still needed during the optimization. All these show complicated interactions between the value/policy function update and function approximation [10] in RL. These are all nontrivial phenomena that do not appear in supervised learning. \n\nFurthermore, a number of techniques which are extremely effective in supervised image classification, such as batch normalization, have been much less successful in NLP due to different architectural paradigms and data sources [13]. For example, BERT, one of the most successful NLP models of recent years, does not use these techniques [14]. NLP generation tasks such as machine translation are also substantially different from typical image classification problems. These are structured prediction problem and it has been shown that techniques like beam search have non-trivial impact on generation quality (e.g. even though at training time we optimize the likelihood of individual tokens, at generation time higher likelihood output is not always the best) [15,16]. \n\nWe note that our results also refute the results of previous studies [7] which investigated the lottery ticket phenomenon in the context of Transformers and were unable to find good winning tickets (critically, this study did not use iterative pruning and late rewinding, which we showed to be essential). We also emphasize that using this approach, we were able to train large Transformer models from scratch to high accuracy while using only one-third the parameters, in stark contrast to previous results. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1053/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1053/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Playing the lottery with rewards and multiple languages: lottery tickets in RL and NLP", "authors": ["Haonan Yu", "Sergey Edunov", "Yuandong Tian", "Ari S.
