The authors remark that the loss has the same gradient wrt to the solver's input as its linearization around the solver's input.  They therefore propose to interpolate the loss' linearization with a continuous (piecewise affine) function and use the gradient of this interpolation to backpropagate through the solver. This gradient is obtained efficiently by simply calling the solver on a single perturbed input (the perturbation depends on the incoming gradient, ie the gradient of the loss wrt to the solver's output).\nThe authors further study the properties of this piecewise affine interpolation and characterize its interpolation behavior as a function of a hyperparameter which controls the trade-off between \"how informative the gradient is\" and \"how faithful the interpolation is to the original solver\".\nThe authors validate their method with experiments on synthetic tasks that have both a visual processing aspect and a combinatorial aspect:\n    - Shortest Path on Warcraft II terrain maps\n    - TSP between country capitals where the inputs to the convnet are country flags\n    - Min-cost perfect matching from Mnist digits.\nSpecifically, they feed the output of a convnet to the relevant solver (depending on the task) and learn end-to-end by backpropagating through the solver with their proposed method. They show that their method successfully solves the tasks where baseline ConvNet architectures fail.\n\n=== Recommendation ===\n\nThis paper addresses an important problem and presents a novel approach.\n\nMethods for combining combinatorial optimization algorithms and machine learning usually rely on modifiying or relaxing the combinatorial problem itself which prevents using solvers as-is. \nIn contrast, the presented method allows to efficiently backpropagate through unmodified implementations of blackbox exact solvers with a linear objective. AFAIK this is the first method that allows this.\n\nA weakness of the paper is that the experiments only validate proof of concept (as noted by the authors). They are small-scale and only compare against conventional ConvNets baselines (as opposed to other approaches to backpropagate through relaxed combinatorial problems).\nAdditionally, the characterization of the interpolation (whose gradient is used) doesn't directly explain why the gradient of the interpolation is a reasonable choice.\n\nOverall, I recommend for acceptance.\n\n=== Questions / Comments ===\n- The authors show properties related to the interpolation behavior of the proposed interpolation function. What is the actual point/benefit of satisfying these properties? Are there arguments for why this is important besides the experimental results?  Is the point that since lambda controls how \"faithful vs informative\" the gradient is , there must be a range of values for lambda for which the method works? \n- It would be interesting to have experiments with non-exact solvers\n- It would be interesting to optimize directly for the combinatorial objective in the experiments (using a policy gradient for example) rather than perform supervised learning on the solutions.\n- Consider adding related work subsection on argmin optimization and meta-learning.\n\n\n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1919/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1919/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["marin.vlastelica@tue.mpg.de", "anselm.paulus@tuebingen.mpg.de", "vejtek@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz", "georg.martius@tuebingen.mpg.de", "michal.rolinek@tuebingen.mpg.de"], "title": "Differentiation of Blackbox Combinatorial Solvers", "authors": ["Marin Vlastelica Pogan\u010di\u0107", "Anselm Paulus", "Vit Musil", "Georg Martius", "Michal Rolinek"], "pdf": "/pdf/1d89c425702b17fe7ee5eae69086ccc14d7acc60.pdf", "TL;DR": " In this work, we present a method that implements an efficient backward pass through blackbox implementations of combinatorial solvers with linear objective functions.", "abstract": "Achieving fusion of deep learning with combinatorial algorithms promises transformative changes to artificial intelligence.

To our knowledge, there are however no established techniques for evaluating gradients suggested for piecewise constant functions (any kind of comparison to the true zero gradient misses the point).\nIn this uncharted territory, our intention was to give a theoretical description and guarantees about the *process* sketched in Figure 3.\n\nThe technical insights embedded in the proofs might also allow for proving different type of guarantees. What would be a convincing statement about piecewise constant function interpolation that Reviewer 3 would like to see?\n\nWe can certainly make some improvements on the presentation side. For example, connect Property A2 to Figure 3 (green regions shrink with lambda) or offer a more intuitive interpretation of Property A3 (it suggests that gradients of f\\_lambda are reasonable everywhere -- as elementary interpolators have certainly reasonable gradients).\n\n== Type of Supervision == \n\nWe agree that supervision based on the value of the combinatorial objective is natural for example in reinforcement learning scenarios and we will look into it in the future. The full supervision we use is however not artificial. The motivation comes from computer vision tasks where the ground truth assignment is typically known (e.g. segmentation, stereo matching, pose estimation).\n\n== Additional Related Work ==\n\nDriven by maintaining focus on the main message, we primarily included literature at the intersection of deep learning and combinatorial optimization in the related work section. The literature that is relevant from the optimization point of view is cited throughout the method section (differentiation through argmin is also discussed). If the reviewer is missing references to concrete works, we will include them. We agree that if the list of optimization references grows by more than a couple of papers, it would be reasonable to introduce a new subsection of Section 2, and we will do so in that case.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1919/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1919/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["marin.vlastelica@tue.mpg.de", "anselm.paulus@tuebingen.mpg.de", "vejtek@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz", "georg.martius@tuebingen.mpg.de", "michal.rolinek@tuebingen.mpg.de"], "title": "Differentiation of Blackbox Combinatorial Solvers", "authors": ["Marin Vlastelica Pogan\u010di\u0107", "Anselm Paulus", "Vit Musil", "Georg Martius", "Michal Rolinek"], "pdf": "/pdf/1d89c425702b17fe7ee5eae69086ccc14d7acc60.pdf", "TL;DR": " In this work, we present a method that implements an efficient backward pass through blackbox implementations of combinatorial solvers with linear objective functions.", "abstract": "Achieving fusion of deep learning with combinatorial algorithms promises transformative changes to artificial intelligence.

Please also refer to our common answer above.\n\n== Linear Programs  ==\n\nThe distinction to make about linear programs is the output format. If the linear program seeks to find an integral solution (ILPs) our method is applicable out of the box. We agree this opens interesting directions for future work.  However, if continuous solutions are required, the function at hand is no longer piecewise constant and other methods (such as [Amos \\& Kolter]) may be preferable in terms of gradient estimation/computation. Also note that our method, in its current form, is designed to optimize an objective and not decide feasibility, as is the case for Sudoku. It takes a deeper thought whether we can generalize the method in that direction.\n\nAlso, thank you for pointing out [Elmachtoub, A. N., \\& Grigas, P. Smart]; we were not aware of this work and will include a reference for the final version.\n\n== Lambda Adaptation ==\n\nWe deliberately did not include any kind of lambda scheduling into the paper as we wanted to keep the method in its purest possible form.

From that perspective, there is no clear baseline to compare with (other than maybe zero order methods). We believe, this puts us in a similar position as works [Wang and Kolter] and [Amos and Kolter] who provided similar building blocks for convex optimization and satisfiability. We actually built on their experimental design -- compare against a ResNet on clean synthetic tasks -- however, with larger dimensionalities in both the raw images and the solver inputs. The main purpose of the ResNet baseline is to make sure the datasets do not contain easily exploitable features.\n\nGiven that there is a volume of work at the intersection of deep learning and combinatorial optimization -- as we also list in Section 2 -- it seems hard to believe that there is no appropriate baseline. Let us briefly explain why for example the works [Bello et al, Deudon et al., Kool et al.] are not comparable to ours. We found similar mismatches with the other cited literature.\n\nThe works [Bello et al, Deudon et al., Kool et al.] aim to compete with the dedicated solvers; purely on the combinatorial side (see their experimental sections). They are not aspiring to be neural network building blocks. In fact, they are not even fully differentiable as the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm executes a sequence of discrete actions (i.e. the same piecewise constant structure emerges) to find the TSP tour. We do not see any natural way for differentiating these pipelines other than casting them as blackbox solvers and using our method.\n\nHaving said all of this, we do not claim (and never have) that our experimental section is a decisive proof of performance; this remains to be seen on more complex real-world applications. At this point, we claim a proof of concept with a broad potential of follow-up applications.\n\n== Additional Experiment == \n\nWe would like to propose to include the results of running our method with an approximate solver. For this we use the Google OR-Tools solver in the TSP experiment.\nWe draw two conclusions from the numbers presented below.\n\n1) The choice of the solver matters. Even if OR-Tools is fed with the ground truth representations (i.e. true locations) it does not achieve perfect results on the test set (see the right column). We expect, that also in practical applications, running a suboptimal solver (e.g. a differentiable relaxation) substantially reduces the maximum attainable performance.\n\n2) The suboptimality of the solver didn't harm the feature extraction -- the point of our method. Indeed, the learned locations yield performance that is close to the upper limit of what the solver allows (compare the middle and the right column).\n\n                             Accuracy of perfect paths\n     Embedding OR-Tools Solver   OR-Tools on GT representation\n k            Train%    Test%                                 Test %\n 5            99.8        99.3                                    100.0\n 10          84.3        84.4                                    88.6\n 20          49.2        48.6                                    54.4\n 40          14.6        15.1                                    15.2\n\nWould you recommend to include this in the paper?\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1919/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1919/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["marin.vlastelica@tue.mpg.de", "anselm.paulus@tuebingen.mpg.de", "vejtek@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz", "georg.martius@tuebingen.mpg.de", "michal.rolinek@tuebingen.mpg.de"], "title": "Differentiation of Blackbox Combinatorial Solvers", "authors": ["Marin Vlastelica Pogan\u010di\u0107", "Anselm Paulus", "Vit Musil", "Georg Martius", "Michal Rolinek"], "pdf": "/pdf/1d89c425702b17fe7ee5eae69086ccc14d7acc60.pdf", "TL;DR": " In this work, we present a method that implements an efficient backward pass through blackbox implementations of combinatorial solvers with linear objective functions.", "abstract": "Achieving fusion of deep learning with combinatorial algorithms promises transformative changes to artificial intelligence.
