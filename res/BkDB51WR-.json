Unclear if this would work at all in higher-dimensional time series. It is also unclear to me what are the sources of the uncertainties captured.\n\n\nThe author proposed to incorporate 2 different discretisation techniques into LSTM, in order to produce probabilistic forecasts of univariate time series. The proposed approach deviates from the Bayesian framework where there are well-defined priors on the model, and the parameter uncertainties are subsequently updated to incorporate information from the observed data, and propagated to the forecasts. Instead, the conditional density p(y_t|y_{1:t-1|, \\theta}) was discretised by 1 of the 2 proposed schemes and parameterised by a LSTM. The LSTM was trained using discretised data and cross-entropy loss with regularisations to account for ordering of the discretised labels. Therefore, the uncertainties produced by the model appear to be a black-box. It is probably unlikely that the discretisation method can be generalised to high-dimensional setting?\n\nQuality: The experiments with synthetic data sufficiently showed that the model can produce good forecasts and predictive standard deviations that agree with the ground truth. In the experiments with real data, it's unclear how good the uncertainties produced by the model are. It may be useful to compare to the uncertainty produced by a GP with suitable kernels. In Fig 6c, the 95pct CI looks more or less constant over time. Is there an explanation for that?\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written. The presentations of the ideas are pretty clear.\n\nOriginality: Above average. I think the regularisation techniques proposed to preserve the ordering of the discretised class label are quite clever.\n\nSignificance: Average. It would be excellent if the authors can extend this to higher dimensional time series.\n\nI'm unsure about the correctness of Algorithm 1 as I don't have knowledge in SMC.", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning temporal evolution of probability distribution with Recurrent Neural Network", "abstract": "We propose to tackle a time series regression problem by computing temporal evolution of a probability density function to provide a probabilistic forecast.

Estimated uncertainty: We are aware of the previous studies, notably Kendall & Gal (2017) and Gal & Ghahramani (2015), where both the model (epistemic) and data (aleatoric) uncertainties are carefully studied in a Bayesian framework. However, as pointed out by the referee, we approach the problem from the Frequentist framework. We aim to make an inference of the probability distribution of the data, or aleatoric uncertainty, given the accuracy of the model. The estimated predictive probability distribution will model both: the data probability distribution and the model error.  However, once the model is powerful enough and the data size is large enough, the estimated probability distribution converges to the true distribution of the data, meaning that the estimated uncertainties will represent the noise in the data. In fact, this latter situation is shown to be indeed the case during the evaluations on synthetic data when powerful enough RNN model is employed. \n\n2. Multivariate time series. We agree with the referee that a na\u00efve extension of the DE-RNN to a higher-dimension based on the tensor-product space will not be scalable. Instead, we propose to compute the joint probability distribution by using a product rule. The detailed method is presented in Section 2.3 and Appendix A. A new numerical experiment is shown in Section 3.5. The proposed DE-RNN for a multivariate time series scales linearly with the number of the dimensions.  \n\n3. Gaussian Processes: We added new comparisons with Gaussian process models. We also used a GP model for the multiple-step forecast on CO2 and CPU temperature data sets. However we did not include the results of GP on the CPU problem since it did not perform well, which might be due the presence of discrete input variables (CPU utilization and clock speed) for which GP is not a suitable approach. \n\n4. Question regarding the uncertainty bound in Fig. 6c: In a multiple-step forecast, the time evolution of a probability density function is essentially a diffusion process. So, in general, it is expected that the prediction uncertainty, represented by 95%-CI, increase with the forecast horizon, which is the case for most of the conventional time series prediction models. But, if we look at the so called \u201cmaster equation\u201d of the time evolution of probability density function (PDF), or the Fokker-Planck equation, the time evolution of a PDF is determined by two terms, advection in the probability space and the regular diffusion (Brownian) process. The later makes the uncertainty, or the width of a PDF, grows in time. However, it seems that when an RNN is used to model the time series, it makes the first term (advection term) convergent, which counteracts the diffusion process. We have observed (see, for example, figure 3 a), when a noisy input data is given to an RNN, surprisingly the prediction seems always moving toward the ground truth. We have shown that the prediction error with respect to the ground truth becomes smaller than the noise level. This observation suggests that the convergence to the ground truth counterbalances the diffusion by the random process, which explains why the uncertainty bound is no longer a monotonically increasing function of a forecast horizon. Although it is not shown, we have tested DE-RNN for a forced Van der Pol oscillator, which has a stationary state, similar to the experiment in section 3.4. For this kind of deterministic system, it was found that the uncertainty bounds fluctuate but do not grow even for a very long (2,000-step) forecast.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning temporal evolution of probability distribution with Recurrent Neural Network", "abstract": "We propose to tackle a time series regression problem by computing temporal evolution of a probability density function to provide a probabilistic forecast.
