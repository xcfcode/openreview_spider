The paper is very thorough in its experimentation, and the method is simple and quite easy to understand. It also raises some important questions about adversarial examples. \n\nHowever, there are serious concerns regarding the evaluation methodology. In particular, the authors claim \"black-box robustness\" but do not test against any query-based attacks, which are known to perform better against gradient masking-based adversarial defenses. Furthermore, it is not clear why one would expect adversarial examples to transfer between models representing two completely different functions (i.e. from a standard model to a random mask model). So, the gray-box evaluation is much more informative and, unfortunately, random-mask seems to provide little to no robustness in this setting.\n\nGiven how fundamental sound and convincing evaluation is for proposed defense methods, the submission is not ready for publication yet. In particular, the authors are urged to (a) evaluate on stronger black-box attacks, and (b) compare to a baseline that is known to be non-robust, (e.g. JPEG encoding or SAP), to verify that these results are actually due to black-box robustness and not simply obfuscation.", "confidence": "5: The area chair is absolutely certain", "recommendation": "Reject", "title": "Some interesting ideas but is not mature enough for publication"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Area_Chair1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Area_Chair1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RANDOM MASK: Towards Robust Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Robustness of neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed  perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs.

Please refer to Figure 14 in our paper for results under the same setting but with different drop rates. The test accuracy monotonically decreases as the defense rate increases along with the drop rate. Therefore, the appropriate value for the drop rate mainly depends on the relative importance of test accuracy and robustness. For example, if a task mainly requires high defense performance instead of high test accuracy, a large drop rate should be used.  \n\n> I am upgrading my reviews after the rebuttal, which actually has convinced me that there is something interesting going on in this paper. However, I'm not entirely convinced as the approach seems to be ad hoc. the intuitions provided are somewhat satisfactory, but it's not clear why the method works.\n\nWe have described our insights on why the proposed method works both in the paper and in our rebuttals which are supported by extensive experiments. Yet we believe that at present, the primary question for adversarial example research is to understand the prevalent existence of adversarial examples with small perturbations against various machine learning methods. Only when this primary question is well-understood can one further discuss why a new method is more robust. However, there is currently no satisfactory theory or insight on why adversarial examples exist. To make the question more specific, let us take the training data of CIFAR-10 as an example. A simple experiment shows that the average \\ell_\\infty distance between two images from different categories is larger than 100.

However, I'm not entirely convinced as the approach seems to be ad hoc. the intuitions provided are somewhat satisfactory, but it's not clear why the method works.. for example, the approach is highly sensitive to the hyperparameter \"drop rate\" and there is no way to find a good value for it. I'm inclined towards rejection as, even though results are almost satisfying, I yet don't understand what exactly is happening. Most of the arguments seems to be handwavy. I personally feel like a paper as simple as this one with not enough conceptual justifications, but good results (like this one), should go to a workshop. \n\n======\nThe authors propose to randomly drop a few parameters at the beginning and fix the resulting architecture for train and test. The claim is that the resulting network is robust to adversarial attacks.\n\nMajor concerns:\nAn extremely simple approach of pruning neural networks (randomly dropping weights) with no justification whatsoever. There are so many other network pruning papers available. If the point is to use pruned network then the authors must provide analysis over other pruning schemes as well.\n\nAnother major concern (technical contributions): How is the idea of randomly dropping weights different from Deep Expander Networks (Prabhu et al., ECCV 2018)?

We think that there might be some misunderstanding here. The presented adversarial examples from the CIFAR-10 dataset are generated using perturbation scale \u03b5=16, 32, yet we have evaluated our model in terms of defense success rate using different \u03b5 values ranging from 4 to 32 - especially the results under the setting of [1] are presented in Section 3.1.1. We have also observed adversarial examples generated using different \u03b5 values. In fact, when \u03b5=8, most adversarial examples from CIFAR-10 against our model are hard for humans to classify. The reason why we present images after larger perturbations is that we found examples capable of \u201cfooling\u201d human eyes using \u03b5 values larger than 8 (See Figure 1). Moreover, as is mentioned in one of your replies, 16/255 is reasonable for ordinary networks. However, in contrast to our model, adversarial examples generated against *normal* CNNs with \u03b5=16 are similar to the original images added with some noise which can be easily ignored by humans.\n\nBesides, as is also mentioned in one of your replies, Table 5 (which extends Table 6 in the original version) is for MNIST, and the perturbation scale used there should not be compared with that used in experiments on CIFAR-10. \n\n[1]Madry, Aleksander, et al. \"Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.06083 (2017).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RANDOM MASK: Towards Robust Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Robustness of neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed  perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs.

For your two major concerns, we first give a brief answer and then provide detailed explanations.\n\n1. Random Mask is NOT a weight-dropping pruning method.\n2. We conduct experiments comparing Random Mask with pruning methods (both you mentioned and those commonly used). It turns out a network with Random mask is far more robust than pruning.\n\n\nDetailed Explanations:\n\n1. Random Mask is a simple but carefully designed method. It removes some nodes in the shallow convolutional layers whose receptive fields are relatively small. This is very different from typical pruning methods which drop weights, remove channels or restrict connections between channels in two adjacent layers. The key idea of Random Mask is that by removing a part of such neurons, the remaining neurons in the shallow layers can not only response to features, but also automatically record the locations of the features. As a result, these remaining neurons in shallow layers together detect the spatial structure of the features, much better than the standard neural networks.\n\nThe motivation of our design comes from the recent observation of adversarial examples. In many cases, the adversarial examples change a patch of the original image so that the perturbed patch looks like a small part of the incorrectly classified object. This perturbed patch, although contains crucial features of the incorrectly classified object, usually appears at the wrong location and does not have the right spatial structure with other parts of the image. For example, the adversarial example of a panda image is misclassified as a monkey because a patch of the panda skin is perturbed adversarially so that it alone looks like the monkey\u2019s face. However, this patch does not form a right structure of a monkey with other parts of the images (see Figure 11 in [1]).\n\nIn sum, current deep neural networks are strong at detecting features, but relatively weak at telling if the spatial location/structure is right. Random Mask tries to strengthen the ability of neural networks in utilizing the spatial information.\n\n2.The experimental results comparing Random Mask with typical pruning methods are given below. Common pruning methods do not improve the robustness of neural networks significantly, while a network with Random Mask is far more robust.\n\nWe test the black-box defense ability of a ResNet-18 with an expander graph compressing all connections between channels by a factor of 2 (following the method proposed in [2]). For comparison, we also list the performance of a ResNet-18 which prunes whole channels in the shallow layers (i.e. Shallow_{DC} in our paper) and a ResNet-18 equipped with Random Mask. The results are listed in the table below. Networks in the first row are the source models to generate adversarial examples by PGD with perturbation scale of 16, step size of 1 and 20 steps.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|\t                            |  DenseNet  |   SENet    |   TestAcc |\n| Normal  ResNet    |      2.96%      |    1.38%   |   95.33% |         \n| Expander ResNet |  \t  3.13%       |    1.46%   |   94.99% |\n| Pruning Channel  |     4.68%       |    2.13%   |   94.97% |\n| Random Mask       |   26.50%      |   21.42%  |   93.39% |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs for your suggestion, we are not sure what hypotheses you hoped to verify by trying dropout at test time. Nonetheless, we think trying dropping at test time is similar to Stochastic Activation Pruning ([3]). In their work, they tested SAP in terms of black-box defense (Figure 1 (c) SAP-100 vs Dense in [3]), yet the performance is not as good as our results when the perturbation scale is 8, 16 and 32. Also, directly dropping at test time and scaling up the remaining will incur a significant drop in test accuracy. We tried to mask out 50% of the neurons in the shallow blocks of a ResNet-18 at test time only, and scale up the rest by a factor of 2. It turned out that the test accuracy dropped to around 20%, which is not acceptable.\n\nFurther discussion is welcomed if our reply does not address your concerns.\n\n[1]Liu, Mengchen, et al. \"Analyzing the Noise Robustness of Deep Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.03913(2018).\n[2]Prabhu, Ameya, Girish Varma, and Anoop Namboodiri. \"Deep Expander Networks: Efficient Deep Networks from Graph Theory.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.08757 (2017).\n[3]Dhillon, Guneet S., et al. \"Stochastic activation pruning for robust adversarial defense.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.01442 (2018).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RANDOM MASK: Towards Robust Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Robustness of neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed  perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs.

There is a contradiction between the claimed method (PGD) and the method in [2] (FGSM) which they compared to in Table 12.

The method removes some neurons in the *shallow* layers of the neural network. We emphasize that the neurons in the shallow layers have relatively small receptive fields. Therefore, by removing a part of such neurons, the remaining neurons in the shallow layers not only response to features, but also automatically record the locations of the features. As a result, these remaining neurons in shallow layers together detect the *spatial structure* of the features, much better than the standard neural networks.\n\nThe motivation of our design comes from the recent observation ([1]) of adversarial examples. In many cases, the adversarial examples change a patch of the original image so that the perturbed patch looks like a small part of the incorrectly classified object. This perturbed patch, although contains crucial features of the incorrectly classified object, usually appears at the wrong location and does not have the right spatial structure with other parts of the image. For example, the adversarial example of a panda image is misclassified as a monkey because a patch of the panda skin is perturbed adversarially so that it alone looks like the monkey\u2019s face. However, this patch does not form a right structure of a monkey with other parts of the images (see Figure 11 in [1]).\n\nIn sum, current deep neural networks are strong at detecting features, but relatively weak at telling if the spatial location/structure is right. Random Mask tries to strengthen the ability of neural networks in utilizing the spatial information. \n\n> graybox results seem to suggest that the effectiveness of the method is due to the baseline...\n\nThe grey-box attacks are very similar to white-box attacks in our setting. We demonstrate in the paper that the adversarial examples (eps = 16,32)  generated by the white-box attacks for Random Mask often fool human as well. We then raise the following questions: 1) Should these adversarial examples be classified as their original categories? 2) How to evaluate the robustness of a method? 3) Can we entirely rely on the currently used performance measures?\n\nIn sum, one of the major goal of this paper is to move a tiny step towards a better understanding of the problem of adversarial example.\n\n[1] Liu, Mengchen, et al. \"Analyzing the Noise Robustness of Deep Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.03913(2018).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper951/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RANDOM MASK: Towards Robust Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Robustness of neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed  perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs.

This method is simple but seems to achieve surprisingly good results. It consist in randomly remove neurons from the network architecture. The deleted neurons are selected before training and remain deleted during the training and test phase.  The authors also study the adversarial examples that still fool the network after applying their method and find than those examples also fool human. This finding raises the question of what is an adversarial example if both humans and networks are fooled by the same example. \n\nUsing Random Masks in neural network is not a new idea since it was already proposed for DropOut or DropConnect (Regularization of Neural Networks using DropConnect, ICML2013) and in the context of adversarial attacks (Dhillon et al. 2018)  as reported by the authors. The discussion (Section 2) about the impact of random masks on what convolution layers capture in the spatial organisation of the input is interesting: whereas standard CNNs focus on detecting the presence of a feature in the output, random mask could force the CNN layers to learn how a specific feature distributes on the whole input maps. This limitation of the CNN has already been pointed up and solutions have been proposed for example Capsule Networks (Dynamic Routing Between Capsules, NIPS 2017). This intuition is experimentally supported by a simple random shuffle by block of the input image  (Appendix A).\n\nIn Section 3, the authors present a large number of experiments to demonstrate the robustness of their method. Most of the details are given in the 13 (!) pages of appendix. Experiments against black-box attack, random noise, white-box attack, grey-box are presented. Most of the experiments are on CIFAR10 but one experiment is also presented on MNIST. One could regret that only one architecture of CNN is tested (ResNet18) except for gray-box attack, for which DenseNet121 and VG19 are tested. One could ask why the type of models tested is not consistent across the different experiments.  For black-box attack, random masks compare favourably to Madry\u2019s defence. For white box defence, Random Mask is not compared to another defence method, which seems a weakness to me but I am not familiar enough with papers in this area to estimate if this is a common practice. In most of the experiments, the drop ratio is between 0.5 and 0.9, which seems to indicate that the size the initial network could be reduced by more than 50% to increase the robustness to attack. This ratio is larger than what is usually used for dropout (0.5 at most).  \n\nIn section 3.3, different strategies for random masks are explored : where to apply random masks, random mask versus random channels, random masks versus same masks. Results are given in table 2. The caption of Table 2 could be more explicit : what are the presented percent ?\n\nExperiments on masking shallow versus deep layers are interesting. Best results for robustness are obtained with masking shallow layers at quite a high ratio (0.9). One could ask if this result could be due to the type or the parameters of adversarial attacks which are not adapted to such a high sparseness on shallow layers or to the specific kind of sparseness induced by the masks. A comparison to a regular network with the same number of free parameters as the masked network could give insight on this aspect. \n\npros : simple to implement, good robustness shown agains a variety of attack types\ncons : mainly tested on a single architecture (ResNet) and on a single datatbase CIFAR.

In this paper, we design a new CNN architecture that by itself has good robustness. We introduce a simple but powerful technique, Random Mask, to modify existing CNN structures. We show that CNN with Random Mask achieves state-of-the-art performance against black-box adversarial attacks without applying any adversarial training. We next investigate the adversarial examples which \u201cfool\u201d a CNN with Random Mask. Surprisingly, we find that these adversarial examples often \u201cfool\u201d humans as well.
