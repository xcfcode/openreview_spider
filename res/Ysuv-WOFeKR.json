We ran the following set of experiments as suggested by the reviewer:\n1. **Evaluate the performance of the method as a function of dataset size**. We observe that training on 10K, 25K or 50K trajectories yields similar performance, but performance drops significantly when training on just 5K trajectories from training tasks. \n2. **Deliberately bias the training dataset so that the training tasks and test tasks are functionally different (i.e. involve substantially different actions)**. We observe that if the prior is trained on pick and place tasks alone, it can still solve downstream grasping tasks well. However, if the prior is trained only on grasping, it is unable to perform well when solving pick and place tasks. We suspect this is due to the fact that pick and place tasks involve a completely new action (that of opening the gripper), which is never observed by the prior if it is trained only on grasping, making it difficult to learn this behavior from scratch for downstream tasks. \n3. **Use the behavioral prior only for exploration, and learn a policy that directly executes its actions in the environment**. This ablation is able to make progress on most tasks,  but is unable to learn as fast as our method, and also demonstrates unstable learning on some of the tasks. We suspect this is due to the following reason: while off-policy RL methods like SAC aim to learn from data collected by any policy, they are in practice quite sensitive to the data distribution, and can run into issues if the data collection policy differs substantially from the policy being learned [3]. \n\nWe have also updated the paper with the suggested references, fixed typos and the rewards/discounted return error, and we plan to release the code for the paper as soon as we finish the cleanup process. Here are the answers to the other specific questions asked by the reviewer:\n\n \u201cAlso, as far as I understand, there is not a strict separation between exploration and \u201clearn a specific task via RL\u201d -- exploration is part of that RL process. Let me know if my understanding here is correct.\u201d Yes, your understanding is correct. \n\n\u201cWould it suffice to say that S and A are fixed?\u201d Yes, it would suffice to say so. We have updated this in the problem setup.\n\n\u201cHow does the asymptotic performance of PARROT compare to vanilla RL?\u201d We ran our vanilla RL experiments for up to 1m timesteps, and we saw that the performance was essentially flat. We believe this is due to the fact that exploration is challenging in our tasks: a +1 reward is given only on task completion, and the frequency with which a +1 reward is observed during exploration is very low for vanilla RL. Note that in the \u201cPick up Baseball Cap\u201d problem, it\u2019s the BC+SAC baseline that slightly outperforms PARROT towards the end, not vanilla RL. While we cannot claim that PARROT\u2019s asymptotic performance is better (since we can only run experiments for a finite time), PARROT did outperform all methods in 7 out of 8 tasks in terms of final performance.\n\n\u201cWhat steps would need to be taken to try PARROT in an environment with discrete actions?\u201d Replacing the real NVP model used in the paper with a model that is suitable for discrete data will allow us to extend PARROT to environments with discrete actions. One such model was proposed by Tran et al [1]. \n\n\u201cHow might PARROT be used in a continual/lifelong learning setting?\u201d\nIn a lifelong learning setting in which the prior changes over time, we could utilize policy distillation [2] to train a new neural network that achieves the same performance as the original policy, but removes dependence on the behavioral prior. This distillation process could be performed soon after the original learning process (or in parallel to it). \n\n\u201cWhat would it take to apply PARROT in a domain where it is not possible to write down good scripted policies?\u201d\nIn domains where it is not possible to write down good scripted policies, we would suggest utilizing one of the following two solutions, depending on the problem: \n1. Collect demonstrations from human experts, assuming such experts are available. \n2. Solve prior tasks using reinforcement learning (assuming these tasks are amenable to RL from scratch), use the trajectories generated from the learned policy to speed up learning new tasks.\n\n[1] Discrete Flows: Invertible Generative Models of Discrete Data.

As we mentioned in our last comment, this baseline involves training a variational autoencoder (a beta-VAE) on observations in the prior dataset, and performs reinforcement learning on top of the features learned by this dataset. This baseline is similar to what has been proposed in prior work for transfer learning in RL [1]. In our problem setting, this baseline does not perform particularly well. We believe this is due to the fact that while Higgins et al [1] focus on learning visual features that are robust to small changes in observation (i.e. green background vs pink background), an additional challenge in our problem setting is that of exploration (since a +1 reward is given only when the entire task has been successfully completed). VAE-based methods that tackle exploration challenges via modeling the actions have also been discussed in the paper (see HIRL and TrajRL in Figure 5). \n\n\n*Re analysis*: \nWe thank the reviewer for noting that the discussion of experimental results could be expanded. In addition to our existing explanation for why our method outperforms competing methods in the introduction of the Experiments section, we have expanded this discussion in the body of the experiments section, accompanied with the additional ablations and analysis suggested by reviewers. In particular, we have run experiments that\n\n1. Evaluate the performance of the method as we vary the amount of trajectories we have access to from the training tasks. We observe that training on 10K, 25K or 50K trajectories yields similar performance, but performance drops significantly when training on just 5K trajectories from training tasks. \n2. Deliberately bias the training dataset so that the training tasks and test tasks are functionally different (i.e. involve substantially different actions). We observe that if the prior is trained on pick and place tasks alone, it can still solve downstream grasping tasks well. However, if the prior is training only on grasping, it is unable to perform well when solving pick and place tasks. We suspect this is due to the fact that pick and place tasks involve a completely new action (that of opening the gripper), which is never observed by the prior if it is only trained on grasping, making it difficult to learn this behavior from scratch down the line. \n3. Use the behavioral prior only for exploration, and learn a policy that directly executes its actions in the environment. This ablation is able to make progress on most tasks,  but is unable to learn as fast as our method, and also demonstrates unstable learning on some of the tasks. We suspect this is due to the following reason: while off-policy RL methods like SAC aim to learn from data collected by any policy, they are in practice quite sensitive to the data distribution, and can run into issues if the data collection policy differs substantially from the policy being learned [2]. \n\n[1] DARLA: Improving Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning.

This definition is borrowed from Kearns and Singh [1], who show that, under certain conditions, there exists an algorithm A that can discover such a near-optimal policy in computation time that is polynomial in $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$. We have updated the paper with this reference. In practice, we could obtain such trajectories from RL agents that were trained on these past tasks, expert demonstrations, or hand-crafted solutions. In this paper, we use the latter in the form of scripted policies. \n\n\u201cThe constraint that the action dimensionalities are fixed seems like a large one. I understand that it\u2019s necessary for the invertible requirement, but I could imagine that a similar approach to this could still be helpful in sim2real problems without this constraint.\u201d \nAs noted by the reviewer, the fixed action dimension is indeed necessary for invertibility. To the best of our knowledge, sim2real problems typically involve agents that have the same action dimension for both the simulated and real versions [2], so we believe this approach could still be applied. For settings where this is not the case, we might need additional modifications to the approach that are beyond the scope of this submission.\n\n\u201cTo what extent do you expect this approach to generalize?\u201d We are optimistic about this approach to generalizing to real world problem domains, due to the following reasons: (1) For prior task trajectories, we don\u2019t require access to reward functions. Since rewards can be difficult to obtain in the real world. (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in problems with high-dimensional observations like images. Such high-dimensional observations are often another challenge we face in real world problems, where we often don\u2019t have direct access to the underlying state of the system. In our opinion, the primary challenges for real world data collection would revolve around collecting large training datasets. In additional experiments we conducted for this rebuttal, we discovered that while 10K trajectories were sufficient to train an effective prior, performance did drop substantially when the number of trajectories was lowered to 5K. \n\n\u201cIt would seem to me still possible that good/useful actions could be placed so far from the center of the Gaussian as to make them very unlikely, depending on the training data\u201d\nWe agree that this can be a concern, especially if there is a significant mismatch between the training dataset and downstream tasks. While we do not have a concrete answer to how we can avoid this (in this submission), we believe this will make for an interesting direction for future research. We have updated the discussion to reflect this.  \n\n[1] Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning in Polynomial Time. Michael Kearns and Satinder Singh.

The policy prior is parameterized as a deep conditional generative model that maps a noise input and a state to an action. The latter map can be inverted, which is important to guarantee that the prior assigns nonzero probability to the full action space for all states. Given a new task, the policy prior is used to parameterize a new policy; the new policy outputs noise inputs to the policy prior\u2019s invertible mapping, which in turn outputs an action in the original action space. This parameterization of the new policy leads to much more targeted exploration versus sampling actions uniformly from the original action space. Experiments are on a suite of pick-and-place robotic tasks in simulation.\n\n### Pros\n\n- The writing is overall very clear and persuasive. The introduction is especially compelling. The sections are well organized.\n- Related work is quite thorough, with just a few potential omissions (see Cons)\n- The problem setup section is very much appreciated. It is difficult to formalize or even discuss the assumptions behind an approach like this, but I thought the authors did a very good job.\n- The problem setting in general is very motivating. It does seem realistic to suppose that a set of expert trajectories from related tasks are available, but that they are not necessarily annotated with rewards. The authors do a good job explaining how this differs from other problem settings like LfD, meta-learning and meta-imitation learning.\n- The whole method is elegant. It is a sensible integration of existing techniques to address a well-motivated problem.\n- The experimental results are strong (though there are many opportunities for additional experiments)\n- The baselines are well chosen\n- The pseudocode in appendix A is clean and clear. All of the notation throughout the paper is too.\n- The paper provides a good level of detail in appendix B for reproducibility\n\n### Cons\n\n- Missing references: \n    -  \u201cLearning Action Representations for Reinforcement Learning\u201d Chandak et al. ICML 2019\n    - \u201cKeep Doing What Worked: Behavioral Modelling Priors for Offline Reinforcement Learning\u201d Siegel et al. ICLR 2020\n    - \u201cResidual Policy Learning\u201d Silver et al. (2018) and \u201cResidual Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control\u201d Johannink et al. (2018)\n- The empirical results are very encouraging, but I would like to have a better understanding of when the overall approach might fail. Some experiments in this direction would include:\n    - Evaluate test-time performance as a function of the number of training tasks\n    - Deliberately bias the training tasks so that they non-uniformly sample from the set, and see how much of an effect that has on the downstream performance. For example, train only on pick tasks and test only on pick-and-place tasks, or vice versa.\n    - More domains beyond the single one considered\n- It would also be nice to see some ablations. In particular, I am curious about the extent to which parameterizing the new task-specific policy with the behavior prior is important, versus just using the behavior prior to gather data. A simple comparison would be to use the behavior prior as an \u201cexploration policy\u201d that is called epsilon% of the time during RL.\n- I highly encourage the authors to release code for the paper\n- Three random seeds is not enough\n\n### Detailed Comments\n\n- Figure 1 is visually compelling, but a little hard for me to follow. I am most thrown off by the \u201cexploration\u201d part, which says: \u201cattempt all possible tasks in a new scene.\u201d I am interpreting this to be somewhat metaphorical -- it is not as though there is actually a list of tasks, and you are attempting each one in a new scene. Also, as far as I understand, there is not a strict separation between exploration and \u201clearn a specific task via RL\u201d -- exploration is part of that RL process. Let me know if my understanding here is correct. If so, I would recommend perhaps cutting the exploration part of this figure.\n- Figure 2 is very helpful and clear\n- In the problem setup, there is discussion of fixed state and action space dimensionalities, but it is not stated that the spaces are vector spaces. Would it suffice to instead say that $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ are assumed fixed?\n- In the problem setup, in two places, there is an expectation over single step rewards that should really be an expectation over temporally discounted returns. \n- In the problem setup, it says: \u201cNote, however, that the optimality assumption is not very restrictive: every trajectory can be interpreted as an optimal trajectory for some unknown reward function.\u201d I think this is misleading. It is true that there is some reward function for every trajectory, but the whole point of the problem setup is that there is assumed to be a nontrivial distribution over MDPs, and the important question is whether the observed data are representative of this distribution.\n- Please indicate in the caption what the lines and shaded areas represent in Figure 5. I assume they are means and standard deviations, but other choices are plausible too.\n- Typos:\n    - \u201cEach task can considered a Markov decision processes\u201d (two typos)\n    - \u201c(making it expressive)\u201d is missing a period\n    - \u201ceach coupling layer in the real NVP take as input\u201d (should be \u201ctakes\u201d)\n    - \u201chyparparameters\u201d\n    - \u201cThis comparisons\u201d\n    - \u201cbehavioural\u201d (I know this is an alternative spelling, but the paper should be internally consistent)\n\n### Questions\n\n-  How does the asymptotic performance of PARROT compare to vanilla RL? Is there a point at which RL starts to outperform PARROT in the tasks considered in this work? It looks like this happens in \u201cPick up Baseball Cap\u201d.\n-  What steps would need to be taken to try PARROT in an environment with discrete actions?\n- How might PARROT be used in a continual/lifelong learning setting? My concern is that if the behavior prior is changing over time, all of the policies that have been parameterized using the behavior prior would also change, and would potentially need to be relearned. (This question does not necessarily need to be addressed in the submission -- I am just curious.)\n-  What would it take to apply PARROT in a domain where it is not possible to write down good scripted policies (like the ones in Appendix C :) )?\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2407/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2407/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Parrot: Data-Driven Behavioral Priors for Reinforcement Learning", "authorids": ["~Avi_Singh1", "~Huihan_Liu1", "~Gaoyue_Zhou1", "~Albert_Yu1", "~Nicholas_Rhinehart1", "~Sergey_Levine1"], "authors": ["Avi Singh", "Huihan Liu", "Gaoyue Zhou", "Albert Yu", "Nicholas Rhinehart", "Sergey Levine"], "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "imitation learning"], "abstract": "Reinforcement learning provides a general framework for flexible decision making and control, but requires extensive data collection for each new task that an agent needs to learn.

Motivated by the idea of pre-training with existing data of similar tasks, the authors propose to learn state-conditional behavioral priors from a set of similar tasks for reinforcement learning agents, such that a learning agent explores its environment in a meaningful way. Successful trials from past tasks are used as training data to learn a mapping from pixel-level state input to actions.

The figures provide a nice illustration of the algorithm and the results are appropriately reported in the graphs.

However, I understand that is sadly now customary in this venue. \n\nThe presented results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, which looks to be at the same time simple and yet very effective. That's great. \nHowever, I have two main issues with the paper:\n1) This paper is directly related to the research domain of transfer learning or knowledge transfer, but this is completely ignored in the related work section. In particular, concepts like learning transferable features would appear quite relevant to this work and should also be considered in the experimental reason. \n2) I was particularly disappointed by the experimental analysis. More precisely, by the 13 lines of the result section that briefly summarise the content of figure 5. In particular, it shows that PARROT outperforms all the other baselines, great, but there is no further comment/discussion/analysis than that. Ideally, a scientific paper should explain (or at least try to) the observed phenomenon, and thus I was expecting some further analysis that would demonstrate the main hypothesis of the paper, for instance via an ablation study. \n\nOverall, I think that this is an interesting paper which shows promising results, while there are a couple of sections in the paper where the same concepts are repeated multiple times and space could be saved and reused to expand the technical description and the result analysis.

Essentially, the authors learn a word2vec style embedding of actions for a simple virtual single-arm environment. This embedding will naturally place more common examples from its training data towards the center of the gaussian, making sampling them during training time more likely. The authors demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing pretraining methods in this domain. \n\nThis paper presents an interesting novel approach and presents strong support for its value. In particular I appreciate that the basic intuition is relatively straightforward and therefore should be relatively easy to test in new domains. In addition, the evaluation results are impressive. \n\nThe paper claims in two instances that human examples would be appropriate for the training data. However, this is not confirmed in the current evaluations to my understanding. The paper indicates that the training data should be \u201cnear optimal\u201d multiple times but never explicitly defines what is meant by \u201cnear optimal\u201d. Is it that actions must be \u201cuseful\u201d (also vague)? More clarity on this would be appreciated. \n\nI have some concerns around certain claims or arguments made in the paper (more on that below). However, this paper still ticks all the boxes for me in terms of novelty and value, and so I would argue for its acceptance. \n\nSome questions for the authors: \n1. What is meant by near optimal? Can this be more formally defined?\n2. The constraint that the action dimensionalities are fixed seems like a large one. I understand that it\u2019s necessary for the invertible requirement, but I could imagine that a similar approach to this could still be helpful in sim2real problems without this constraint. Would the authors agree?\n3. The paper domain is still relatively simple compared to real world problem domains, to what extent do you expect this approach to generalize? \n\nSome smaller points/additional feedback: \n- The introduction and abstract are a bit vague, and I didn\u2019t grasp the approach intuition until figure 1. I\u2019d appreciate if some of this information could be moved up into paragraph 3 of the introduction. \n-I\u2019d replace \u201clarge such datasets\u201d with \u201csuch large datasets\u201d or just remove \u201csuch\u201d\n-I recognize that theoretically that the approach should be able to represent every possible environment action, but it would seem to me still possible that good/useful actions could be placed so far from the center of the Gaussian as to make them very unlikely, depending on the training data. Some discussion about how to avoid this/whether it is a concern would be helpful.
