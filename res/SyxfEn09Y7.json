The basic idea is to identify the basis paths in the path graph, and convert the weight update in SGD to the weight rescaling in G-SGD. My major concerns are as follows:\n\n1. Empirical significance of G-SGD: While the idea of exploring the structures of relu neural networks for training based on group theory on graphs is interesting, I do not see significant improvement over SGD. The accuracy differences in Table 1 are marginal, training/testing behaviors in Fig. 3 are very similar, and more importantly there is no evidence to support the claims \"with little extra cost\" in the abstract/Sec. 4.3 in terms of computation. Therefore, I do not see the truly contribution of the proposed method.\n\nPS: After reading the revision, I am happy to see the results on computational time that support the authors' claim. However, I still have doubts on the significance of the improvement on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, because the performance is heavily dependent on network architectures. In my experience, using resnet101 it can easily achieve >96% accuracy. So can you achieve better than this using G-SGD? The training and testing behaviors on both datasets somehow show improvement over SGD, which I take it more importantly than just those numbers. Therefore, I am glad to raise my score.\n\n2.

Q: Significance of experiments in Table 1.Similar training/testing behaviors in Figure 3. \nThe performance gain by G-SGD in Table 1 is not marginal. For example, since it can eliminate the influence of positive scaling invariance across all layers of PlainNet, G-SGD can averagely improve the accuracy number by 0.8 and 5.7 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively, over 5 independent runs. Moreover, Plain-34 trained by G-SGD achieves even better accuracy than ResNet-34 trained by SGD on CIFAR-10, which shows the influence of invariance on optimization in weight space as well.\nIn our experiments, we employ the training strategies in the original ResNet paper [1] (which is designed for SGD) for both SGD and our G-SGD. This is the reason why the training/testing behaviors are similar. In the future, we will design training strategies for optimization in G space, which will further enhance its performance.\n\n2. Q: Evidence of low computational cost.\nBy the update rule of G-SGD in Section 11.1 (i.e., Eqn (43) and Eqn(46)), the extra computation is the calculation of $R^t(p^j)$. It is clear that the computation overhead of our G-SGD is upper bounded by $(B+1)T$ (B is the batch size and T is the time of processing one sample, and the cost of SGD is BT). Considering that the computation cost of original SGD is $BT$, G-SGD has \u201clittle extra cost\u201d. We will add the complexity analysis and the figure of training throughput on our GPU server in the appendix. Please see the next version of our paper.\n\n3. Q: Connection between step 3 and 4 in Alg.3.\nWe assume your comments are about Alg 1, since there is no Alg. 3 in our paper. Please let us know if not. In step 3, we calculate the gradient with respect to basis path by solving Eqn (3) in Inverse-Chain-Rule method. Then, we update basis paths according to SGD accordingly. After that, we can compute the update ratio for basis path. In step 4, we allocate the update of basis path to the update ratio of weight.  \n\nThank you for the valuable suggestion. We will add the connection between step 3 and step 4 in the next version. \n\n[1] He K, Zhang X, Ren S, et al.

Q: Path-SGD results for the CIFAR experiments?\nIt is unaffordable to compute gradients  with respect to all the paths, thus the authors in [1] take coordinate-independent approximation in Path-SGD (Eqn(7) in [1] can be referred). The authors design Path-SGD only for MLP[1] and RNN[2],  and  the Path-SGD for CNN is non-trivial. Therefore, the result of Path-SGD on ResNet and PlainNet is not provided in Table 1. We do compare with Path-SGD for MLP case in Figure 5. \n\n2. Q: Experimental proof of computational overhead?\nThanks for your advice. We will add the figure of training throughput on our GPU server in the appendix. Please see the next version of our paper.\n\n3. Q: Code Release within one of the standard deep learning frameworks.\nWe plan to open source the codebase of our implemented G-SGD, not only for reproducing our experimental results, but also as a toolkit which can be freely used for the community.\n\n4. Q: The chosen of \u201cfree skeleton weights\u201d? The necessity of their presence?\nDifferent selections of free skeleton weights are mathematically equivalent and all the theoretical results will preserve, e.g., the activation status is a function of basis path if the signs of free skeleton weights are fixed.\nActually we can project the gradient with respect to basis path back to any weights on that path, but according to weight-allocation method, we want to reduce the number of update executions to reduce the time complexity. Hence, we choose one skeleton weight to update on all-basis path (which is only composed by skeleton weights) and others are selected to be free skeleton weights.\nAlthough there is no update on those \u201cfree skeleton weights\u201d,  they are necessary because the \u201cvalue of path\u201d is composed by all weights on one path. We can delete a weight only when it always takes value \u201c0\u201d.  Free skeleton weights are not initialized as \u201c0\u201d, and they indeed play a role in calculating the value of path and also in feedforward process in G-SGD. \n\n5. Q: High computational overhead of the gradient of path norm?\nThe gradient of path regularizer is hard to calculate exactly and a coordinate-independent approximation is made in Path-SGD which  costs (B + 1)T (B is the batch size and T is the time of processing one sample, and the cost of SGD is BT). The computation cost of our G-SGD is also (B+1)T (Please refer to Eqn(43)-Eqn(46)), which is comparable with the approximation of Path-SGD. We will clarify this comparison in the next version. \n\n6. Q: Is the advantage of G-SGD over SGD expected to be proportional to the invariant ratio for CNNs as well?\nYes, we have similar observations for CNN. \n\n[1] Neyshabur. B, et al.

The present paper proposes to change the optimization procedure so that it is done in a space where this invariance is preserved (in contrast to the weight space, where it is not). To do so, the authors define the group G of positive scaling operators, and note that the \"value of path\" (product of weights along the path) is G-invariant and together with \"activation status of paths\" allows for the definition of an equivalence class. They then build a G-space which has fewer dimensions than the weight space, and proposed g-SGD to optimize the network in this space. In g-SGD gradients are computed normally, then projected to G-space via a sparse matrix in order to update the values of paths. The weights are then updated based on a \"weight allocation method\" that involves the inverse projection.\n\nThe authors conduct experiments on CIFAR-10 and -100 with a ResNet-34 and a similarly deep variant of VGG, showing significant benefits from G-SGD training in all cases. They also evaluate the performance of a simple MLP on Fashion-MNIST as a function of the invariant ratio H/m.\n\nComments:\nThe paper is organized well (with technical details of the proofs delegated to the appendix), and discusses the differences in comparison prior work. While evaluations on large-scale datasets would be helpful here, the present experiments suggest that optimization in G-space indeed consistently improves results, so the proposed method seems promising.\n\nFor completeness, it would be great to include Path-SGD results for the CIFAR experiments in Table 1, together with runtime information to highlight the benefits of the g-SGD algorithm and provide experimental proof that the computational overhead is indeed low.\n\nIf the authors are hoping for a wider adoption of the method, it would be helpful for the community to have the g-SGD code released within one of the standard deep learning frameworks.\n\nQuestions:\n- Does it matter which weights are chosen as \"free skeleton weights\"? If these weights never get updated in the optimization procedure, could you please comment on the intuitive interpretation of the necessity of their presence?\n- The text states that the computational overhead of the gradient of path norm is \"very high\". The Path-SGD paper proposes a method costing (B + 1)T, where the overhead an be small for large batches. It would be good to clarify this a bit in the present text.\n- Is the advantage of g-SGD over SGD expected to be proportional to the invariant ratio for CNNs as well?\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1431/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "G-SGD: Optimizing ReLU Neural Networks in its Positively Scale-Invariant Space", "abstract": "It is well known that neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLU) activation functions are positively scale-invariant.
