We have addressed the main concerns that you indicated as the reason for your rating  \u20183: weak reject\u2019 and we believe that we could sufficiently improve in all these aspects. Especially, we clarify below that our evaluation of the test performance is correct.\n\n[1. Comparison to DeepSqueeze]\nThank you for pointing us to this highly related parallel work. In the revision we added DeepSqueeze to our comparison in Table 1 (all compression schemes on Cifar 10). The results for sign compression show that DeepSqueeze performs slightly worse than DCD and CHOCO-SGD. We will try to provide more of the missing values in the Table until the revision deadline (or latest for the final version).\n\nFor the experiments we independently tuned the hyperparameters of DeepSqueeze, with the same grid search as for the other schemes (the grid in our search is dynamically extend, to make sure that the chosen values do not lie on the boundary and are indeed optimal), allowing for a fair comparison. \n\n[2. Consensus]\nWe added evaluation of the consensus distance to the paper. (See Fig. 9).\n\n[3. Reporting of the performance]\nPlease let us clarify: We mention on page 5 that \u201cWe evaluate the top-1 test accuracy on every node separately over the whole dataset and report the average performance over all nodes.\u201d In formulas, this means that we report mean(g(x_i)), where g() measure the test accuracy (on the full test set) and x_i denotes the model on node i (this is the expected performance of a uniform random sampled model). We agree with you that if nodes would only evaluate performance with respect to a local part of the test set, then the results would not be convincing, but this is not what we report.\n\nComputing the averaged model \\bar{x} = mean(x_i) requires one more full communication round (and might not be possible in the peer-to-peer decentralized setting). \n\nFor completeness, we added the test performance g(\\bar{x}) of the averaged model to the appendix (i.e. Figure 9 for the social network graph experiment with Resnet20 on Cifar10 dataset; we will run LSTM on WikiText-2 to obtain the corresponding plots as well)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2016/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2016/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["anastasia.koloskova@epfl.ch", "tao.lin@epfl.ch", "sebastian.stich@epfl.ch", "martin.jaggi@epfl.ch"], "title": "Decentralized Deep Learning with Arbitrary Communication Compression", "authors": ["Anastasia Koloskova*", "Tao Lin*", "Sebastian U Stich", "Martin Jaggi"], "pdf": "/pdf/3934e547bc85fc7fb307d0440ebfc85da4efec1d.pdf", "TL;DR": "We propose Choco-SGD---decentralized SGD with compressed communication---for non-convex objectives and show its strong performance in various deep learning applications (on-device learning, datacenter case).", "abstract": "Decentralized training of deep learning models is a key element for enabling data privacy and on-device learning over networks, as well as for efficient scaling to large compute clusters.

If this is the case, the reported perfromance and comparison are not convincing. Without consensus, different nodes can have individual minimizer. In this case, the obtained average loss can be even smaller than the optimal loss.

This is an interesting problem and the results are promising. Firstly they prove the convergence rate of the algorithm on non-convex smooth functions, which shows a nearly linear speedup. \n\nSecond, on the practical part, there have 3 main results:\n\t1. They compare CHOCO-SGD under various compression schemes with the baseline. The results show the algorithm generally outperforms the baseline.\n\t2. They implement it over a realistic peer-to-peer social network and show a great communication performance under such a network with limited bandwidth.\n\t3. In a datacenter setting, they compare the algorithm with all-reduce, which is a centralized communication method. The results show a strong training reduction for CHOCO-SGD.\n\nAlso, the paper is mostly nicely written.\n\nHowever, there have several issues:\n\n\t1. In the introduction, they introduce their experiments with the order from \"datacenter experiment\" to \"peer-to-peer experiment\", which is different from the actual presenting order.\n\t2. In the description of Algorithm 1, the representation of initial values should be x{(-1/2)}_{i} instead of x{(0)}_{i} since line 2 using the term x^{t-1/2}_{i} with the range of t from 0 to T-1.\n\t3. About \"datacenter setting\" experiment, it seems not an apple to apple comparison between CHOCO-SGD and all-reduce method since CHOCO-SGD stands for the decentralized algorithm with compression and all-reduce stands for a centralized algorithm without compression. It's better to compare with at least one centralized algorithm with a compression scheme (like QSGD[1], signSGD[2], DGC[3]).\n\t4. Although they compare with the baseline (DCD and ECD) on Cifar-10 dataset,  it's worth to compare with them on the ImageNet since the result may be different under large-scale training.\n\nOverall, this could be a great paper if fixing the issues above.\n\n\n[1] D.

We show that Choco-SGD achieves linear speedup in the number of workers for arbitrary high compression ratios on general non-convex functions, and non-IID training data.  We demonstrate the practical performance of the algorithm in two key scenarios: the training of deep learning models (i) over decentralized user devices, connected by a peer-to-peer network and (ii) in a datacenter.
