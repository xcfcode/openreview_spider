Although the authors claimed that the proposed method can mitigate the double descent phenomena, this claim is not so particularly attractive currently because the classical OED also mitigates it in the illustration of Figure 1\u201d\n\nThe technical procedure appears after Prop 3.  We slightly revised the next in order the clarify the connection. What we try to express in Figure 1 is that while classical methods mitigate the double decent issue, they do it on the expense of not dealing well with the bias, as can be seen in Figure 1: the bias oriented regime is not handled well by classical methods. Yes, they flatten the variance dominated area, but do not gain anything in the bias dominated area.\n\n(2) It\u2019s true that 'Francis R. Bach, Active learning for misspecified generalized linear models, NeurIPS2007' also relates to the bias term. However, the bias term has a different source in their work (misspecified model) and the solution (re-waiting the loss) is fundamentally different than ours. We were aware of this work, but failed to cite it do to oversight. We now added a citation.\n\n(3) Regarding the work of 'Gu, et al., Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization, NeurIPS2012': we were actually not aware of it and we thank the reviewer for pointing us to it. Indeed, Gu, et al. showed that the criterion of Yu et al 2006 is a bound on both the bias and variance, however they did not show what we show in Prop 4., that  the criterion of Yu et al 2006 is actually equal to ours when lambda=t. We think that this fact is crucial and has practical meanings. We were already related to this practical meaning in Appendix D.  However, in the revised version we clarified it further, with direct reference to the work of  'Gu, et al., Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization, NeurIPS2012' and a new experiment that show why the  'Gu, et al./Yu et al.  it is important to understand that the bound implies t=lambda and how to use it.\n\n(4) Obviously a good setting of the parameter t requires some good model of the noise (that what we see in figure 1. actually). In sequential experimental design there is plenty of room to set both t and lambda. However, we stress that even in single shot experimental design there is setting then t=lambda as Yu et al/Gu, et al., suggest may. We made it more clear now with a new experiment on UCI data that shows that many times setting t=0 is better then setting t=lambda, and anyway is not particularly worse.\n\n (5)\nThe experiment section is now improved. There is a direct comparison with what we see as our direct competitors Yu et al. and Core Set (Sener & Savarese, 2018), We show new state of the art results on UCI classification tasks and add the comparison to Core Set to Fig 2 comparing to the single shot deep active learning. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1627/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1627/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Experimental Design for Overparameterized Learning with Application to Single Shot Deep Active Learning", "authorids": ["~Neta_Shoham1", "~Haim_Avron4"], "authors": ["Neta Shoham", "Haim Avron"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Abstract The impressive performance exhibited by modern machine learning models hinges on the ability to train such models on a very large amounts of labeled data.

The paper claims that, for over-parameterized setting, incorporating the bias information is particularly important, and further, shows a kernelized extension and a greedy calculation strategy.\n\nThe paper focuses on an important problem of active learning, and is written clearly. The approach is reasonable, and the method would be easy to implement. However, technical significance would be somewhat weak. The derived bound of the expected error is quite simple, though it is ok but an important unknown constant is kept and no detailed discussion is provided for that constant. Further, the experimental result is not convincing to show the superiority of the proposed criterion compared with other existing approaches. Detailed comments are as follows.\n\nIn the first section, the authors mentioned about the recent 'double decent' phenomenon in over-parameterized model, and related the proposed approach with it. However, I couldn't find any particular technical procedures or discussions specific to the double decent phenomenon in the main text. Although the authors claimed that the proposed method can mitigate the double descent phenomena, this claim is not so particularly attractive currently because the classical OED also mitigates it in the illustration of Figure 1. If the proposed method can mitigate double decent that classical OED cannot, it would be attractive. \n\nThe derivation of the proposed AL criterion is performed through the classical expected risk. The paper repeatedly claims importance of incorporating bias-dominated or mixed nature, unlike classical variance based approach. However, this idea (considering the bias effect in AL) itself is not novel though it is not clearly described. For example, 'Francis R. Bach, Active learning for misspecified generalized linear models, NeurIPS2007'.\n\nA similar bound analysis to the paper is also shown in 'Gu, et al., Selective Labeling via Error Bound Minimization, NeurIPS2012'. Although this paper is for a manifold based semi-supervised learning, it includes the usual linear model estimation as a special case. They derived a bound for the estimation error of the parameter that reflects both of the bias and variance terms (from which expected error can be derived). Their approach is similar to (Yu et al 2006) that the authors cited, but an important point is that they showed the criterion of (Yu et al 2006) can be seen as a bound of 'both of' bias and variance terms though it is originally shown as a variance-based. This would be important past analysis closely related to the proposed method, and should have been mentioned.\n\nObviously, hyper-parameter t would be a key factor in the proposed criterion. However, no practical discussion on how to set t is provided. In my opinion, as far as this constant remains unknown, the proposed bound is not so particularly innovative. Further the regularization parameter lambda can be problematic because unlike the usual supervised learning scenario, it sometimes should be determined before observing y.\n\nThe experiment in Section 7 is not convincing because the authors only compared with random design, and it only shows results of the bias-dominated setting of the proposed method, though the mixed nature of the expected error was repeatedly emphasized in the paper.

However, the problem setting has some overly strong assumptions, such as prefixed design and iid errors, which can make the solutions trivial and not very useful in practice.\n\nI don't recommend the paper to be accepted in its current form for the following reasons:\n\n1. I think the main results of the paper in Section 3-5 concerns a conventional problem: Experimental design for the ridge regression. They do not provide a solution aligned with the main motivation, bridging experimental design and deep learning.\n2. The theoretical analysis did not provide sufficient new insights. It actually confuses me that it introduces an additional parameter t on page 5, without exploring its relationship with the original regularization parameter lambda. \n3. The connection with deep active learning is not sufficiently explained. Also the evaluation task looks overly simple and uses a trivial baseline; I would expect at least a comparison with another active learning algorithm, for example, using the coreset approach.\n\nOther specific concerns:\n\n-  I find the expression \"single shot active learning\" confusing. Does it mean active learning with a prefixed (hence unsupervised) design?\n- The last sentence of Sec 2, para 1 is incorrect. Actually, it contradicts Eq 1. \n\n\nIn general, I think that the paper can be improved with a more focused contribution statement, and better connecting the results with the claimed contributions.

Unconvincing results. Limited applications.", "review": "In this paper, the authors develop a data selection scheme aimed to minimize a notion of Bayes excess risk for overparametrized linear models. The excess Bayes risk is the expected squared error between the prediction and the target. The authors note that solutions such as V-optimality exist for the underparametrized cases (linear regression), and offer extensions to ridge regression. After the development of a greedy schemes and a tentative extension to deep learning models, the authors show that their selection scheme can outperform random selection on MNIST with a specific model.\n\nActive learning, both online and batch, is a well-studied problem with real-world applications. The paper does a fair job of developing the new technique but the addition seems incremental, and the algebra even though involved, is largely straightforward. The results are also unconvincing, and the one figure in the main body (Fig 2) only shows comparison with a weak (random selection) baseline. Furthermore, in the deep learning regime, 500-800 data points are somewhat unrealistic and do not cement the value of the method in real-world scenarios. Some other concerns include:\n\n1. Unsubstantiated claims like \u201cAs such, the theory reported in the literature is often not applicable in the interpolative regime\u201d. \n\n2. Unconvincing contributions description, \u201csometimes able to mitigate the double descent phenomena\u201d, \u201csometimes able to find better design than random selection\u201d.\n\n3.
