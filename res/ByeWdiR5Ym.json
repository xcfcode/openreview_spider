Why there is still a need to combine adaptive convolutions with regular convolutions? What would the model performance be for a model with only adaptive kernels?\n\nR)It is possible to change all the layers to use Adaptive convolutions, we replaced only one to measure the unitary contribution. We chose the first one because it is where the feature extraction is performed, in addition fully connected layers can use this technique. One Adaptive layer can replace two traditional layers.  (Added to the paper)  \n\n2. I might have missed it, but I couldn't find any motivation on why tanh is used as nonlinearity. Would the method work with relu?\n\nR) We can use any Activation function. We actually tested ReLu with good results, but we chose tanh because it generates weights in the range of (-1,1) avoiding large values given by ReLu. (Added to the paper) \n\n3. Traditional convolutional kernels together with max pooling operations ensures some degree of translation invariance. How big is the generalization gap for the tested models when adaptive kernel is used?\nR)we added an experiment to test the generalization\n\n4. How sensitive are the results to the number of adaptive kernels in the layers.\n\nR) As in traditional CNNs, the increment of the number of kernels in a layer produces some saturation, with a marginal increment of accuracy. In our experiments it was observed that 5 dynamic kernels generates comparable level of abstraction than 30 traditional convolutional kernels. (Added to the paper) \n\n5. Adaptive kernels have only been tested in the first convolutional layer, would the adaptive kernels work well also in different layers?\nyes we have test several layers with adaptive kernels. but we focus on report the results on the first layer to highlight the contribution    \n \n6. On CIFAR10 the results seem to be worse that other methods. However, it is important to note that the Adaptive Kernels CNN has way less parameters. It would be interesting to see how the performance of adaptive kernels based CNNs scales with the number of parameters.\n\nR)We added a new experiment where we show how the performance of adaptive kernels improves with the increment of parameters. In order to make a fairer comparison we also added another experiment where we compare the accuracy of ResNet18 with 1 adaptive layer against ResNet18, ResNet50 and ResNet101 and it can be seen that the adaptive one performs even better than ResNet50.\n\n7. The evaluation on two datasets seems to be rather limited, additional comparisons should be included.\nR) Added another experiment, where we use DroNet as base to show the benefit of combine Adaptive layers with ResNet, in this experiment we test different configurations to compress the network up to 32X  (Added to the paper)\n\n8. The authors acknowledge the similarities (and some differences) with Brabandere et al (2016). It might be beneficial to include comparison to this approach in the experimental section. Moreover, given the similarities, it might be good to discuss the differences in the approaches in the introduction section.\n\nR)they train a NN to generate a model of another NN, we  have a ACNN that learns how to generate its filters.  (in the intro)\n\nSome typos:\n1. the difficult to train the network\n2. table 2: Dynamic -> Adaptive?\nVery Good Catch \uf04a\n\nOverall, the paper presents interesting ideas with some degree of originality. I'd encourage the authors to extend the intro and position the ideas w.r.t. existing works and extend the evaluation.\nWe compared now against: mobileNet, ShuffleNet, HENet, SqueezeNet, we have less number of parameters or better accuracy or both (Added to the paper)\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper330/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper330/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper330/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "The quest for increased visual recognition performance has led to the development of highly complex neural networks with very deep topologies.

The authors' should add some wording to explain this value. \n\nR) Thank you this good observation (Added to the paper)\n\nThe \"adaptive\"kernels the the authors talk about are really a new class of nonlinear kernels.  It would be very interesting to see a discussion of the class of functions these nonlinear kernels represent.  This kind of discussion would give the reader  motivation for the choice of function, ideas for how to improve in this class of functions, and insight into why it works.\n\nThe method presented is interesting; but it is not clear that it is present with enough detail for it's results to be replicated.  It would be nice if the authors pointed to a git repository with their code an experiments.\n\nR) Now we have a pytorch version of the code at https://github.com/adapconv/adaptive-cnn\nWith MNIST and CIFAR. \n\n \nMore importantly, the results presented are quite meager.  If this is a method for image recognition,\n1)\tit would be better to present results for a more substantial image recognition problem than MNIST and CIFAR-10.  \n\nR) We added a new experiment for a real life application; testing different topologies.\n\n2)\tAnd the analysis of the \"dynamic range\" of the algorithim is missing.\nR) New data was added to the paper exercising multiple topologies, in a wider range of applications. \n\n3) How do performance and model size trade off?\nR)     A new experiment added to the paper shows the accuracy degradation vs model compression  \n\n4) How were the number of layers and kernels chosen?\n\nR)We started with the original topology replacing convolutional kernels by the Adaptive kernels, then we reduced kernel by kernel, retraining the model each time to match the accuracy (with small drop). But our proposal is not the topology is the new type of filters, so many topologies can be improved using this type of filters, for instance an Adaptive ResNet.      \n \n5) Was the 5x10x20x10 topology used for MNIST the only topology tried?\nR)We tested many, and we think that we can continue reducing the model, but our purpose is not to present a topology, our purpose was to show the advantages of Adaptive convolutions, having a model 66X smaller, 2X less MAC operations and trained 2X faster give us the clue that many researchers can explore on their own topologies and get benefits of it.\n     \n  6) That would be very surprising.  What is the performance on all of the other topologies tried for the proposed algorithm?\nR) A table comparing different topologies is included in the new version of the paper.\n \n7) Was crossvalidation used to select the topology?  If so, what was the methodology. \nWe started with the reference topology like: ResNet18, LeNet, etc. then we reduce the number of kernels and layers keeping similar accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, some readers may find this paper a little difficult to read due to (1) lack of clarity in the writing, e.g., the first three paragraphs in Section 3; (2) omitted details, e.g., \n1)how much overlap exists between kernels (Figs. 1, 2, and 4 suggests there is no overlap - this should be made clear); \nR)That is right, there is not overlap.\n\nand (3) poor grammar and nonstandard terminology, e.g., the authors' use of the word \"energy\" and the phrase \"degradation problem\".

In at least one case, the training time is also significantly reduced (2x).\n\nThe best part about this paper is that the size of the models are much smaller; but the paper does offer any explanation of the value of this.  For example, even a 1% drop in accuracy can be unacceptable; but in some applications (like cell phones and IOT devices) model size is critical.  The authors' should add some wording to explain this value.\n\nThe \"adaptive\"kernels the the authors talk about are really a new class of nonlinear kernels.  It would be very interesting to see a discussion of the class of functions these nonlinear kernels represent.  This kind of discussion would give the reader  motivation for the choice of function, ideas for how to improve in this class of functions, and insight into why it works.\n\nThe method presented is interesting; but it is not clear that it is present with enough detail for it's results to be replicated.  It would be nice if the authors pointed to a git repository with their code an experiments.  More importantly, the results presented are quite meager.  If this is a method for image recognition, it would be better to present results for a more substantial image recognition problem than MNIST and CIFAR-10.  And the analysis of the \"dynamic range\" of the algorithim is missing.  How do performance and model size trade off?  How were the number of layers and kernels chosen?  Was the 5x10x20x10 topology used for MNIST the only topology tried?  That would be very surprising.  What is the performance on all of the other topologies tried for the proposed algorithm?  Was crossvalidation used to select the topology?  If so, what was the methodology. \n\nAdditionally, some readers may find this paper a little difficult to read due to (1) lack of clarity in the writing, e.g., the first three paragraphs in Section 3; (2) omitted details, e.g., how much overlap exists between kernels (Figs. 1, 2, and 4 suggests there is no overlap - this should be made clear); and (3) poor grammar and nonstandard terminology, e.g., the authors' use of the word \"energy\" and the phrase \"degradation problem\".

The benefit of adaptive kernels is the reduction of memory usage (at training and at the inference time) as well as training speedups (up to 2x). The kernels are evaluated on two datasets MNIST and CIFAR10\n\nI like the idea of building models that are memory efficient at training and at evaluation time. However, the evaluation of the proposed adaptive kernels is rather limited. In order to improve the paper, the authors could take into consideration the following points:\n\n1. Why there is still a need to combine adaptive convolutions with regular convolutions? What would the model performance be for a model with only adaptive kernels?\n2. I might have missed it, but I couldn't find any motivation on why tanh is used as nonlinearity. Would the method work with relu?\n3. Traditional convolutional kernels together with max pooling operations ensures some degree of translation invariance. How big is the generalization gap for the tested models when adaptive kernel is used?\n4. How sensitive are the results to the number of adaptive kernels in the layers.\n5. Adaptive kernels have only been tested in the first convolutional layer, would the adaptive kernels work well also in different layers?\n6. On CIFAR10 the results seem to be worse that other methods. However, it is important to note that the Adaptive Kernels CNN has way less parameters. It would be interesting to see how the performance of adaptive kernels based CNNs scales with the number of parameters.\n7. The evaluation on two datasets seems to be rather limited, additional comparisons should be included.\n8. The authors acknowledge the similarities (and some differences) with Brabandere et al (2016). It might be beneficial to include comparison to this approach in the experimental section. Moreover, given the similarities, it might be good to discuss the differences in the approaches in the introduction section.\n9. The ideas presented in the paper seems related to general concept of hypernetworks, where one network learns (or helps to learn) paramenters of the other network. It would be nice to position the ideas from the paper w.r.t. this line of research too.\n10.
