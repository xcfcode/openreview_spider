Results are reported on citation benchmarks and compared for increasing number of labeled data.\n\nThe presentation of the paper could be significantly improved. Details of the proposed model are missing and the effects of the proposed regularization w.r.t. other regularizations are not analyzed.\n\nMy main concerns are related to the model design, the novelty of the approach (adding a reconstruction loss) and its experimental evaluation.\n\nDetails / references of the transposed convolution operation are missing (see e.g. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7742951). It is not clear what the role of the transposed convolution is in that case. It seems that the encoder does not change the nodes nor the edges of the graph, only the features, and the filters of the transposed convolution are learnt. If the operation is analogous to the transposed convolution on images, then given that the number of nodes in the graph does not change in the encoder layers (no graph coarsening operations are applied), then learning an additional convolution should be analogous (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf Figure 4.3.). Could the authors comment on that?\n\nDetails on the pooling operation performed after the transposed convolution are missing (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00165.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09375.pdf). Does the pooling operation coarsen the graph? if so, how is it then upsampled to match the input graph?\n\nFigure X in section 2.1. does no exist.\n\nSupervised loss in section 2.2.1 seems to disregard the sum over the nodes which have labels.\n\n\\hat A is not defined when it is introduced (in section 2.2.2), it appears later in section 2.3.\n\nSection 2.2.2 suggests that additional regularization (such as L2) is still required (note that the introduction outlines the proposed loss as a combination of reconstruction loss and supervised loss). An ablation study using either one of both regularizers should be performed to better understand their impact. Note that hyper-parameters chosen give higher weight to L2 regularizer.\n\nSection 3 introduces a bunch of definitions to presumably compare GCN against SRGCN, but those measures of influence are not reported for any model.\n\nExperimental validation raises some concerns. It is not clear whether standard splits for the reported datasets are used. It is not clear whether hyper-parameter tuning has been performed for baselines. Authors state \"the parameters of GCN and GAT and SRGCN are the same following (Kipf et al; Velickovic et al.)\". Note that SRGCN probably has additional parameters, due to the decoder stacked on top of the GCN. Reporting the number of parameters that each model has would provide more insights. Results are not reported following standards of running the models N times and providing mean and std.

We are sorry for causing confusion and misunderstandings on some technical issues. We make the following clarifications.\n1) As noted by the reviewer, convolution operator in GCN is actually quite different from convolution on images. The encoder does not change the nodes nor the edges of the graph, only the features. In particular the dimensionality of the output feature space is much lower. \n\n2)##comment on transposed graph convolution## \nOur main idea is to reconstruct the original features and use the reconstruction errors as a regularization, so the output feature vectors in the low-dimensional space needs to be transformed back into the original space; in particular, the dimensionality needs to be lifted to match the original space. Therefore, one can think of the transposed GCN as a GCN being reversed, which also does not change the graph, but only the features.\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s consider a simple one-layer GCN as an example. Now the output of GCN is Z=\\sigma(\\hat{A} XW), where X is the input feature matrix and W is a trainable weigh matrix. To reconstruct X from Z, the transposed GCN is applied on Z: X\u2019=\\sigma(\\hat{A}^T Z W\u2019^T). Here \\hat{A} is symmetric, so the transpose operator could be omitted and W\u2019 is another trainable weight matrix. To make the dimensionality of X\u2019 and X the same, W and W\u2019 must have the same size and the linear transformation W\u2019 also needs to be transposed before applying on Z. \n\n3) ##Clarification on pooling##\nThe pooling method used here follows e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03536.pdf, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216, which is different from pooling in CNN for images. Here, we simply use the entry-wise max function: max(X, \\hat{A}X), which also does not change the graph, but only the features. So, it is more like an activation function and doesn\u2019t coarsen the graph. We followed previous work and called this pooling. We are sorry for causing confusion. Now we have made the pooling more explicit in the revised paper and hope that this resolves the concern of the reviewer. \n\n4) In our original paper, the supervised loss in section 2.2.1 is ambiguous. So, we have revised it in the new version.\n\n5) We have added the definition \\hat A in section 2.2.2 as suggested by the reviewer. \n\n6) ##comment on L2 regularization##\nBoth GCN and GAT use a L2 regularizer in all their experiments. But as demonstrated by our empirical and theoretical results (section 3 in the new version), L2 regularizer is not enough to handle few-show learning. Our main contribution is a new regularization. The experiments show that the performance of GCN + L2 + new regularizer significantly outperforms GCN + L2. So we think it is fair enough to say that our new regularizer is highly effective.\nWe emphasize that we don\u2019t mean to replace standard regularization methods. \n\n7) ##Simplified analysis##\nWe have greatly simplified the mathematics in section 3. We reorganized the material and simplified the notations that causing much confusion before. In particular, we removed the notion of influence distribution of Xu et al., as we find that this notion is not necessary for our purpose. We think that the revised version provides a clearer and more mathematical explanation on why shallow GCN is not sufficient for few-shot learning and why standard regularization doesn\u2019t help.\n\n8) ##comment on higher weight for L2 regularizer##\nFor the weights of the regularizers, one should see that higher weight doesn\u2019t mean the corresponding regularizer is more important. In our case, although a higher weight is given to the L2 regularizer compared with the reconstruction loss (0.0005 vs 0.0001), the overall effect of the reconstruction loss is much stronger. The main reason that the weight of the reconstruction regularizer is smaller is that the reconstruction loss is a function of all feature vectors, whose total size is n*d (n is the number of nodes and d is the number of input features). n*d is typically much larger than the number of parameters in our setting. In particular, after training, 0.0001*reconstruction loss is always much larger than 0.0005*L2.\n\n9) ##Hyperparameters##\nNote the encoder and decoder of SRGCN are two symmetric GCNs and we use the same set of hyper-parameters for them, which are exactly the same as suggested by Kipf et al. The only additional parameter SRGCN has is the weight of the reconstruction loss, which is set to 0.0001 in all experiments. All the parameters were explicitly listed in section 5.1.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper482/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper482/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper482/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Few-shot Classification on Graphs with Structural Regularized GCNs", "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of semi-supervised node classification in attributed graphs with a focus on \\emph{few-shot} learning.
