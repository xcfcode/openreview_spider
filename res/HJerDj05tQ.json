For the manifold optimization with a single manifold, to ensure that the iterative point x_{k+1} always moves on manifold, we need the operator $Retr_{x}$: $Retr_{x}(v)$ is a map from $T_{x}\\mathcal{M}$ to manifold $\\mathcal{M}$, where $T_{x}\\mathcal{M}$ is the tangent space at point $x\\in\\mathcal{M}$. Since ${\\rm grad}f(x)$ is on $T_{x}\\mathcal{M}$, $x_{k+1} = Retr_x_{k}(-1/L({\\rm grad}f(x_k))$ must live on manifold.\nIn fact, the iterative points obtained by the updating rule $x_{k+1} = Retr_{x_{k}}(v_{k})$ locate on manifold as long as $v_{k}\\in T_{x_{k}}\\mathcal{M}$. Since the updating rule in our paper satisfy $v_{k}\\in T_{x_{k}}\\mathcal{M}$, iterates must live on the corresponding manifold.\nFor the case with multiple manifold where the optimization region corresponds to the intersection of these manifolds ,  existing methods cannot guarantee that iterates live on the intersection of manifolds, because intersection of manifolds may not be a manifold. They can only reach minima on each manifold rather than the intersection of them. In contrast, our method heuristically sets the updating direction on one manifold as the manifold gradient perturbed by the gradient information from other manifolds. This updating rule renders the common minima which is shared by all the manifolds, if there exists, as the only stable points of our algorithm. This is a heuristic argument rather than a theoretical analysis.", "title": "reply to gradient descent on manifold"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimization on Multiple Manifolds", "abstract": "Optimization on manifold has been widely used in machine learning, to handle optimization problems with constraint.

However, there are various major mathematical, conceptual and algorithmic problems with this paper.", "review": "\nThe title is misleading, since only two particular manifolds are studied in this work. In addition, the proposed methods cannot be applied to a larger or a general class of manifolds. Therefore, you should update the title.\n\nThere are multiple problem definitions proposed in the paper. They are not compatible with each other and also with the proposed methods. In addition, some of the proposed problem definitions are incorrect, as explained below:\n\nYou should be more precise about the definition of the manifold you consider in this paper. For example, in equation (1), please define your manifold of interest more precisely checking some standard textbooks.\n\nPlease define intersection of manifolds, what do you mean by which intersection of which type of manifolds?\n\nIn the contribution (1); the paper does not introduce an algorithm to deal with optimization on with multiple manifolds, but for a particular type of individual manifolds.\n\nIn the contribution (2): It is not clear why and how the proposed method can be applied to optimization on manifolds with momentum (what do you mean by use of momentum here?), and regularization (what do you mean by regularization?). There are many problems with this claim, but you can simply consider that applying momentum and regularization will affect the geometry of loss landscape.\n\nDefinition of retraction is not precise, please fix it.\nWhat is L in equation (2)?\n\nPlease define neighborhood in U_x in Lemma 2.1.\n\nWhat is || ||in Lemma 2.1?\n\nAs you also noticed on page 3, an intersection of manifolds may not be a manifold. Then, your proposed first problem (1) fails. Therefore, you should completely change your claims on your problem definitions and contributions.\n\nWhat do you mean by \u201cWe add a drift which contains information from the other manifold to the original gradient descent on manifold\u201d? What is \u201cthe information from the manifold\u201d? In equations (3) and (4), you just apply optimization on manifolds individually. \n\nHow do you compute/determine a_k^(1) and a_k^(2)? How do they affect the theoretical and experimental results?\nIn your claim \u201cFrom the construction of bk, we can see that the smaller the correlation between gradf(xk) and hk is, the smaller effect the information from M2 brings\u201d, it is not clear how \u201cthe information from M2\u201d affects? First, again, what is \u201cthe information\u201d? Second, b_k^(1) and b_k^(2) are computed for individual manifolds separately. Then, how \u201cthe information\u201d make an effect?\n\n In Theorem 2.2, what do you mean by \u201cthen xk convergence to a local minimizer\u201c?\n\nWhat is <,> in Theorem 2.2?\n\nWhat is ^ in Theorem 2.3?\n\nWhat is v in proof 6?\n\nWhat is an engine value?\n\nWhat does P (1) xk gradf(yk) denote in computation of h_k? For example, gradf(yk) is a vector on tangent space of the second manifold at yk. Then, how do you project orthogonally this projected vector to the tangent space of the first manifold at xk? \n\nThey may be completely different geometries, and such an \u201corthogonal projection\u201d may not exist in general. Then, how do you compute and calculate that projection?\n\nAll the theoretical results given in the paper are not about convergence of parameters on a manifold at the intersection or product of manifolds but for an individual manifold. For example, x and y belong to manifolds M1 and M2, and convergence results is about x. How are they related to parameters at the intersection or product of manifolds?\n\nThe statements regarding batch normalization are confusing and also sound incorrect:\n\nDo you apply batch normalization on weights on BN(w)?\n\nPlease explain what you mean by \u201cBN(w) has same image space on G(1, n) and St(n, 1)\u201c. There are not such results in the papers Cho & Lee (2017); Huang et al. (2017) you cited for these results.\n\nWhat do you mean by \u201capplying optimization on manifold to batch normalization problem\u201d?\n\nIn your statement \u201cHowever, the property of these two manifold implies that we can actually optimize on the intersection of two manifolds\u201d. Please explain how does this property imply this result more precisely?\n\nPlease define \u201cGrassmann manifold G(1, n)\u201c more precisely. In your notation, together with explanation of the notation for St(n,p), G(1,n) is like a set of 1xn dimensional row vectors, while St(n,1) is an nx1 dimensional column vector, Then, their intersection is an empty set and your proposal for optimization on a vector on their intersection is wrong. \n\nNotation and definitions used in (9) are wrong and confusing. Please check and revise them.\n\nIn the whole paper, the problem, method, solutions, theorems, and contributions are proposed for optimization using parameters which belong to intersection of some manifolds. Then, suddenly, you start considering optimization on product manifolds, and give the results for that;\n\nWhat does the statement \u201cThen we apply Algorithm 1 to update parameters, which means we optimize on a product manifold\u201d mean?\n\nWhat do \u201cG(1, k1) \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 G(1, kn)\u201d and \u201cSt(k1, 1) \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 St(kn, 1)\u201d denote?\n\nDon\u2019t you perform optimization on intersection of manifolds? Why do you ignore your original problem and methods, and consider this problem? \n\nIn addition, how do you use your Algorithm 1 for optimization on product manifolds? Optimization on intersection on manifolds and product manifolds are completely different problems. If they are same or related to each in particular cases in your specific definitions, then you should provide these definitions more precisely.\n\nWhat do you mean by optimization on product manifold of weights of all layers? If you compute a product manifold for spaces of all layers, then you simply perform a shallow optimization on a huge matrix containing millions of dimensions according to this definition. First, how do you do that? Second, how can you train a large network using this approach?\n\nIn the experiments, please first give variance of errors. These results are statistically insignificant.\n\nWhich problem is solved to perform these experiments is not also clear (see above).\n\nThe results reported in the paper are also not good, may be due to the mathematical and algorithmic  problems and errors mentioned above. Please clarify them, and provide additional results, especially using other datasets (small scale mnist and large scale imagenet), and networks (mlp, vgg, resnet etc.)\n\nRelated work is also incomplete, such that many traditional and recent work on optimization on multiple manifolds are omitted.

An optimization algorithm is proposed and its convergence analysis is given. An experiment of neural network with batch normalizatiion is used to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.\n\nThe problem considered in this paper is interesting. However, there are quite a few fundamental errors about Riemannian optimization. In addition, the convergence analysis is not complete. See more details below. Therefore, I donot think this paper can be published at this stage.\n\n*) P2, Section 2.1, line 2: The statement \"A manifold is a subspace of R^n$ is not true in general.\n*) P2, Section 2.1, line 7: The statement \"manifold is not a linear space\" is not true in general. A manifold can be a linear space, such as the vector space R^n.\n*) P2, Section 2.1, below (2): The statement \"Riemannian gradient is the orthogonal projection of gradient \\nabla f(x) ...\" is not true in general.\n*) P3, (3) and (4): what is the definition of $h_k^{(1)}$ and $h_k^{(2)}$. Are they arbitrary or the ones given on Page 4?\n*) P4, Theorem 2.3: the iterates {x_k} converges in the sense that \\|gradf(x_k)\\| goes to 0. Does {x_k} go to the intersection of the two manifolds \\mathcal{M}_1 and \\mathcal{M}_2? To complete the proofs, the author may need to show that \\|gradf(y_k)\\| goes to 0 and {x_k} and {y_k} have the same limit.\n*) P5, the grassmann manifold with p = 1: G(1, n), is called projective space, and the Stiefel manifold with p = 1: St(n, 1) is called the unit sphere.\n*) P6, the discussion of the intersection of G(1, n) and St(n, 1) does not make sense to me. G(1, n) is a quotient manifold, which is not a submanifold of R^n. Given a quotient manifold, the typical way in optimization framework is to choose representation of the quotient manifold. Fortunately, the projective space has a global orthogonal section, which is the unit sphere. In other words, G(1, n) is diffemorphisic to the unit sphere St(n, 1), and even can be isometric if appropriate Riemannian metrics are used on G(1, n) and St(n, 1). Therefore, I don't understand the notion of the intersection of G(1, n) and St(n, 1).\n\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper259/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Optimization on Multiple Manifolds", "abstract": "Optimization on manifold has been widely used in machine learning, to handle optimization problems with constraint.
