The use of weighting in meta-update is motivated from distributional uncertainty, but it is not clear how that will improve the task calibration at meta-testing time.\n- The proposed update runs into the risk of focusing on simple tasks and down-weighting hard tasks that could be improved with more learning to get more discriminative features. That might hurt the classification performance even though it gets better calibration quality.\n- Novelty is limited. The proposed method is a fairly small modification on the original MAML algorithm.\n- More comprehensive empirical evaluation is required to support the superiority of the proposed method to other baselines.\n\nI suggest the authors take all the reviewers' comments seriously and improve their work for a better revision.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task Calibration for Distributional Uncertainty in Few-Shot Classification", "authorids": ["~Sungnyun_Kim1", "~Se-Young_Yun1"], "authors": ["Sungnyun Kim", "Se-Young Yun"], "keywords": ["few-shot learning", "meta-learning", "uncertainty estimation"], "abstract": "As numerous meta-learning algorithms improve performance when solving few-shot classification problems for practical applications, accurate prediction of uncertainty, though challenging, has been considered essential.

Two TC extensions of existing methods (MAML and ProtoNet), namely TC-MAML and TC-ProtoNet, have been presented and experimented. The main contributions of this work the authors pointed out are (1) it's in a non-Bayesian fashion thus is computationally efficient and (2) the TC method can be applied to a range of meta leaning models, and (3) the method is more effective for the few-shot meta-learning situation under dataset shift.\n\nI think this paper deals with an interesting idea but should be improved further. Also the contributions are not clearly supported. The authors should do some more work to demonstrate their contributions. My comments are as below.\n\n1) Regarding the contribution (1), the authors only showed that ABML (amortized Bayesian meta-learning) was computationally expensive, while very efficient Bayesian approximation method based on MC-dropout for the implementation in a Bayesian fashion. The authors should evaluate and compare in terms of the computation time to demonstrate the proposed method is really computationally efficient compared to those in a Bayesian fashion. Also, they need to do something to demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently handle complex and high-dimensional data sufficiently well.\n\n2) Regarding the contribution (2), there are a variety of meta-learning models that have been presented in recent years (e.g., MetaSGD, TAML, and many more). Which of them can be combined with the TC method? It would be great if the authors investigate the applicability of TC to other existing methods and see if TC improves their performance by experiments as well.\n\n3) Regarding the contribution (3), only one dataset shift case (mini-ImageNet -> CUB-200) was experimented. I strongly recommened the authors to evaulate ther method on other dataset shift cases with additional datasets (e.g., Omniglot).\n\n4) In Table 1 and Table 2, I can't find \"significant\" improvement of the proposed methods (TC-) compared to their baselines in terms of \"classification accuracy\" which is the most important metric. In particular in the case of 5-Way 5-shot for mini-ImageNet, TC-MAML was worse than MAML and TCProtoNet was worse than ProtoNet. How, and in which aspect, could you say the proposed methods are \"significantly\" better?\n\n5) For the organization of this paper, things should be more consistent. For example, accuracy was reported in table 1, but wasn't in table 2 (although provided in appendex B.5). In table 3, the experimental results for MAML and its variants are not provided (althouth the authors mentioned that MAML is already robust for the corrupted tasks).\n\n6) Aren't the methods sensitive to the architectural and training configurations of the CNN models? \n\n7) I think in the current manuscript, there are some strong conjectures that need to be supported by theoretical evidences or more experimental results. For example, \"That is, modeling episteme is not much helpful for the calibration in few-shot classification.\" and the sentences that describe the main contributions.\n\n-----\ni've upated my rating after the authors' response.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper304/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper304/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task Calibration for Distributional Uncertainty in Few-Shot Classification", "authorids": ["~Sungnyun_Kim1", "~Se-Young_Yun1"], "authors": ["Sungnyun Kim", "Se-Young Yun"], "keywords": ["few-shot learning", "meta-learning", "uncertainty estimation"], "abstract": "As numerous meta-learning algorithms improve performance when solving few-shot classification problems for practical applications, accurate prediction of uncertainty, though challenging, has been considered essential.

In training, if a task has low class-wise similarity, then the task is assigned a higher weight; if a task has high class-wise similarity, then it would be considered ill-defined and assigned a lower weight during training. Experiments on mini-imagenet  and CUB-200 show that it can improve MAML and ProtoNet\u2019s classification performance and uncertainty estimation.\n\nI disagree with the paper\u2019s definition of \u2018ill-designed\u2019 tasks. When clases in a training task are very similar, I think it just means that this training task is harder for the model to learn. Therefore, the task at least shouldn\u2019t get a lower weight and somewhat get ignored during training. If at test time, a test task also has very similar classes close to this training task, then this \u2018ill-defined\u2019 training task could actually help. With the current method, I think if the data set gets bigger and more complicated, the classification performance will drop significantly. Because the current method would filter out the hard tasks and ignore them during training to some extent. \n\nAs for the experiment part, the paper also only conducted experiments on relatively small and simple data sets, mini-ImageNet and CUB-200. If the authors can add an experiment on Tiny-ImageNet and show some performance improvements there, it can make the experiment part much more solid.\n\nThe paper says \u2018A well-calibrated network often exhibits lower accuracy compared to an overconfident deep network\u2019 in the introduction. It is a false claim. There are a lot of  post-training methods to measure uncertainty at test time. They don\u2019t affect the model\u2019s classification performance since they are post-training methods. Moreover, DeepEnsemble improves the classification performance of a classifier at the same time when it improves the model\u2019s uncertainty estimation.\n\n####################Post Rebuttal#######################################\n\nI meant tiered-ImageNet (https://github.com/renmengye/few-shot-ssl-public). I apologize for the mistake. \n\nI think the rebuttal has not addressed my concerns, especially the one related to the 'ill-defined' tasks. The 'ill-defined' tasks detected from the proposed method could be 'hard but good' tasks benefitting the test. The authors didn't deny this. And the proposed method tries to push the model to learn less from such tasks. A natural deduction is that it could affect the classification performance. I think if the authors can take a further step to disentangle uncertainty estimation and classification, this con of the proposed method can be removed in the future.

The method modifies the MAML meta-learning approach by weighting the task-specific loss using class-wise similarity, measured by the cosine similarity of the task features. The authors further propose to use this weighting on metric-based models for few-shot classification. \n\nThe change in weighting proposed by the paper, although incremental, provides an appreciable performance improvement of existing meta-learning methods. However, some comparisons to existing uncertainty calibration methods are recommended to show a more comprehensive evaluation. In particular, one claim is its advantages over Bayesian methods. Probabilistic MAML [1] and Bayesian MAML [2] could be readily applied as additional comparisons to the author\u2019s proposed method. For metric-based methods, as the authors indicated, it may worth testing with more recent developments, including TADAM.\n\nAn additional experiment could also be useful to verify that the class similarity weighting is performing its intended purpose. For example, one can construct a task where the labels are shuffled as in Zhang et al. [3]. Because the labels are uninformative, the task should not be useful for meta learning and should provide almost zero weight.\n\nThe description of task corruption experiments can be improved. Were the reported results based on the total four tasks for meta-training only as described in Appendix B.1? Also, it may worth putting the results from MAML variants in addition to ProtoNet. \n\nThe authors motivated the method with the discussion of distributional uncertainty. A more explicit characterization relating the posterior predictive distribution to the proposed method would strengthen the paper.\n\nThere are also several typos in the current submission.

We have modified the introduction part to clarify our contributions.\n\n1. ABML is a Bayesian target calibration method, which is also based on MAML as in our approach. We compared our work with ABML and showed computational inefficiency of ABML in terms of memory and time (see Appendix B.3). We did not consider the MC-dropout since training methods in meta-learning do not use dropout in general.  \n\n2. Our method works by measuring support-query discrepancy. The support-query discrepancy can be computed whenever tasks consist of support and query examples and the backbone contains the features. We thus believe our work is universally applicable to both optimization-based and metric-based approaches. Existing algorithms such as Meta-SGD and TAML are entirely available to work with the task calibration. In this work, we tested the task calibration with MAML and ProtoNet since they are very basic algorithms.\n\n3. We will include additional dataset shift experiments as you suggested.\n\n4. The main focus of our experiment is on how the TC method increases the calibration ability in few-shot tasks, not about the classification accuracy. In table 1 and table 2, the important metric is ECE and MCE. Test accuracy is just to validate that TC method does not hurt the classification ability.\n\n5. We added the MAML result in table 3.\n\n6. We used Conv4 (miniImageNet and CUB) and ResNet18 (dataset shift) architectures, and the improvements were consistent. Regarding the training configuration, we tried different learning rates and confirmed there was a consistent reduction in ECE and MCE, although we fixed the learning rate for the final results.\n\n7. We revised some unclear descriptions that is not thoroughly investigated.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper304/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper304/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Task Calibration for Distributional Uncertainty in Few-Shot Classification", "authorids": ["~Sungnyun_Kim1", "~Se-Young_Yun1"], "authors": ["Sungnyun Kim", "Se-Young Yun"], "keywords": ["few-shot learning", "meta-learning", "uncertainty estimation"], "abstract": "As numerous meta-learning algorithms improve performance when solving few-shot classification problems for practical applications, accurate prediction of uncertainty, though challenging, has been considered essential.

The main challenge of this problem is unknown. The description of the problems in the first page is kind of misleading as authors describe many problems, not sure whether authors intend to resolve them all or just part of them. The main contribution of this work is not well motivated. \n\nMy main concern is that the contribution of this work is not strong. The main contribution of this work is imposing the class-wise similarity on the meta-update rule in Equation (4). The meta-update is part of the model-agnostic meta-learning pipeline as shown in Equation (2) [Finn et al., 2017]. Equation (4) seems reasonable. However, the novelty of this work is not clear. For example, is the class similarity computation first proposed in this work? Is the weighted meta-update never used in existing literature?\n\nMy another concern is that the motivation is not clear. The main problem/problems authors aim to solve are not specified or emphasized. There are many challenges mentioned in this work, such as aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, few-shot classification, distributional mismatch between support and query data, the trade-off between calibration and the performance of a model.

In this study, we contemplate modeling uncertainty in a few-shot classification framework and propose a straightforward method that appropriately predicts task uncertainty. We suppose that the random sampling of tasks can generate those in which it may be hard for the model to infer the queries from the support examples. Specifically, measuring the distributional mismatch between support and query sets via class-wise similarities, we propose novel meta-training that lets the model predict with careful confidence. Moreover, our method is algorithm-agnostic and readily expanded to include a range of meta-learning models. Through extensive experiments including dataset shift, we present that our training strategy helps the model avoid being indiscriminately confident, and thereby, produce calibrated classification results without the loss of accuracy.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "kim|task_calibration_for_distributional_uncertainty_in_fewshot_classification", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8eece071054ffe7c8c9dd4bd0f1bede100d49515.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/4cb98bda9becb90d7df5ee490da711e17c38b9aa.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=J-urYNTmJP", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkim2021task,\ntitle={Task Calibration for Distributional Uncertainty in Few-Shot Classification},\nauthor={Sungnyun Kim and Se-Young Yun},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ba82GniSJdc}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
