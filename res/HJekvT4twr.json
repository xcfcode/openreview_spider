Summary: The authors proposed a deep neural network-based model to generate responses fro task-oriented dialogue systems. The model mainly contains two parts, the first part is to retrieve relevant responses based on question and encode them into templates, the second part is a decoder to generate the response based on the encoded templates and input utterances.\n2. Assessment: The problem studied in this work is very interesting and important. The high-level idea also looks interesting. However, this paper is clearly not ready to submit as it contains a lot of grammar errors and lacks a lot of important details. \n2.1 \"In our model, we retrieval ...\" => \"we retrieve\", \"which is composed of a encoder ...\" => \"an encoder\". There are too many such language errors in this paper. \n2.2 Table 2 is not finished yet. There's only one result in it.\n2.3 What does \"triple form\" mean? What are the candidate responses to retrieve when doing inference? What are the details of reference response retrieval? To many such important details are missing."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper582/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper582/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RGTI:Response generation via templates integration for End to End dialog", "authors": ["Yuxin Zhang", "Songyan Liu"], "authorids": ["zhangyuxin960625@gmail.com", "anchor3l31@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["End-to-end dialogue systems", "transformer", "pointer-generate network"], "TL;DR": "A new simple but efficient model for end-to-end dialogue ", "abstract": "End-to-end models have achieved considerable success in task-oriented dialogue area, but suffer from the challenges of (a) poor semantic control, and (b) little interaction with auxiliary information.

While the motivation and task setup is interesting, the paper is clearly unfinished. Most jarringly, Table 2 which should contain the main results comparing the proposed RGTI model to existing baseline models is not filled in, and there appears to be no table showing results of the ablation study briefly described in Section 3.4.\n\nOther issues include the lack of detail around any of the subtasks mention. For example, in Sec 2.1, how is semantic information used as search criteria to retrieve responses? We also need to see more details about where responses are retrieved from. In Sec 2.2, how is the splitting done to construct tuples from the candidate templates (the word \"in\" is dropped in the example given, and it's not clear if this is a typo or whether some processing is done over the phrases before tuple construction is done).\n\nOther comments:\n- The paper needs to be heavily proofread. There are many spelling/grammar mistakes, for example:\n\t- dilogue -> dialogue (Figure 2, page 2)\n\t- acurrate -> accurate (top of page 3)\n        - \"First we should retrieval responses\" -> \"retrieve responses\" (page 3)\n        - BlEU -> BLEU (page 5)"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper582/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper582/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "RGTI:Response generation via templates integration for End to End dialog", "authors": ["Yuxin Zhang", "Songyan Liu"], "authorids": ["zhangyuxin960625@gmail.com", "anchor3l31@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["End-to-end dialogue systems", "transformer", "pointer-generate network"], "TL;DR": "A new simple but efficient model for end-to-end dialogue ", "abstract": "End-to-end models have achieved considerable success in task-oriented dialogue area, but suffer from the challenges of (a) poor semantic control, and (b) little interaction with auxiliary information.

Then, we exploit candidate response attention to get templates which should be mentioned in response. Our model can integrate multi template information to guide the decoder module how to generate response better.
