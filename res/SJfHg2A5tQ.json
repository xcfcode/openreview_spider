However, worse still, most people in academia don't think so because they need these so-called improvements to publish their papers. Papers like ABC-Net, Group-Net they claimed they can achieve near fp accuracy but they don't release their code, thus the improvements they claimed are not necessarily to be achievable by most other people. \n\nThe paper from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08637.pdf reports a result on binary resnet18 on imagenet: 54.5%/77.8%,  which doesn't use any training tricks like scaling factor, customized gradient, fine-tuning from fp models, fp short-cut etc.\nThey just use the simplest sign function, STE, Adam and standard training solution. But higher acc can be achieved. However, such paper is often just ignored by academia, because most people from this community think there is no \"novel\" idea proposed, although sometimes pointing out the truth and establishing a better standard should be really meaningful for the long-term development.\n\n\n\n", "title": "Is our research work aimed at publishing papers or seeking truth?"}, "signatures": ["(anonymous)"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["(anonymous)", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BNN+: Improved Binary Network Training", "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are widely used in many applications.

We plotted the weight distribution, and we found that we can't see two peaks around 1 and -1, we only see one peak around 0, which is the same as other normal L1&L2 regularization functions. Can you produce two peaks around alpha and -alpha? If not, can you explain why regularization function is important, in a more reliable way? In the paper, we only see the assumption, you didn't give any plot like weight distributions.\"\n\n\nThe objective of including this modified regularization function is indeed to gradually encourage the weights around \u2013alpha and +alpha. You should try to implement our proposed regularizers. Of course, while training we can clearly see (visually) that the weights are distributed around two peaks. Note that alpha is also trainable in our framework, therefore, the weight distribution is conditional on alpha\u2019s value.\n\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: As the regularization function is one of your only two contributions, I hope we can see more valid results and analytical explanations and experiments, so we can reproduce it and improve the performance in other tasks.\n \n\nPlease read the updated version of the paper. As stipulated in the abstract,  \u201cWe propose an improved binary training method (BNN+), by introducing a regularization function that encourages training weights around binary values. In addition to this, to enhance model performance we add trainable scaling factors to our regularization functions. Furthermore, we use an improved approximation of the derivative of the sign activation function in the backward computation.\u201d Not only we propose a new way to training binary networks, we also performed an extensive number of experiments to show that the methodology is actually working.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: Bi-real net achieves Top-1 56.4% Top-5 79.5% in ResNet-18(ImageNet dataset) while yours is 53% and 72.6% respectively, maybe your paper do not achieve highest performance over state-of-the art, and your experiments results may not be enough. Can you show more network experiments like deeper Resnet-34 50 or even Densenet which LQ-Nets actually did and did it well.\n\nAs stated in the  discussion section of the paper (Section 4.3), \u201cWe did not compare our network with that of Liu et al. (2018) as they introduce a shortcut connection that proves to help even the full precision network.\u201d Indeed, the results you cite are the ones using a modified real-valued weights shortcut connection that makes Bi-real net and BNN+ not comparable. However, in [1], their implementation of Resnet-18 achieves 45.7% top-1 accuracy at most on ImageNet dataset.\n\nAlso, as stated in the conclusion, \u201cFor future work, we plan on extending these to efficient models such as CondenseNet (Huang et al., 2018), MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017), MnasNet (Tan et al., 2018) and on object recognition tasks.\u201d\n\n \n[1] Zechun Liu, Baoyuan Wu, Wenhan Luo, Xin Yang, Wei Liu, and Kwang-Ting Cheng.

It would be easy to implement and compare to their approach, and they do report ImageNet results. Here is a link if you need: https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1Lc-Gb0Z. I believe that they also provide code to run their method. In more detail:\n\n(A) Absolutely, there is no guarantee that [1] would work with binary weights but also no reason to think that it wouldn't for the reasons outlined previously. It would be trivial for you to run one more evaluation using your approach with their STE (essentially, just a tanh) to determine if there is actually any merit to your STE. Alternatively, it would be trivial for you to run one more evaluation using your STE with their approach, for the same effect. \n\n(B) This is clearly false. [1] has ImageNet results. Half of Section 4 in [1] is dedicated to ImageNet results. \n\nTo reiterate, my point is that [1] also improves on the hardtanh STE. Thus, while your method may also improve on the hardtanh STE, it does not necessarily improve on the method of [1], which already improved on the hardtanh STE. Since your STE has a similar softening as that of [1], it is not clear whether your introduced STE is achieving the same thing that [1] achieved or if there is merit to your claim that the non-monotonicity is important. While, absolutely, this claim could be true, you have not demonstrated that it is; instead, you have simply claimed that it is while comparing only to older work.

Using the methods presented, the validation accuracies on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 are improved by just under 2 percentage points.\n\n  Pros:\n    - Decent improvement in the performance of the binarized network in the end\n    - The presented regularizers make sense and seem effective. The modified straight-through estimator seems reasonable as well, although the authors do not compare to recent work with a similar adjustment. \n\n  Cons:\n    - The paper is poorly written and confusing. It reads as if it was written in one pass with no editing or re-writing to clarify contributions or key points, or ensure consistency.\n    - While the final numbers are acceptable, the experiments themselves could be stronger and could be presented more effectively.\n   - The novelty of the scale factors is questionable.\n\n\nQuestions and comments:\n\n1. How exactly is the SS_\\beta activation used? It is entirely unclear from the paper, which contradicts itself in multiple ways. Is SS_\\beta used in the forward pass at all for either the weight or activation binarization? Or is only its derivative used in the backward pass? If the latter, then you are not replacing the activation anywhere but are simply using a different straight-through estimator in place of the saturated straight-through estimator (e.g., see [1]).\n   (a) At the beginning of Section 3.3, you say that you modify the training procedure by replacing the sign binarization with the SS_\\beta activation. This sounds like it is referring to the activation function at each layer; however, the pseudocode says that you are using sign() as the per-layer activation. \n   (b) Further, Figure 4 shows that you are using the SS_\\beta function to do weight binarization. However, again, the pseudocode shows that you are using sign() to do the weight binarization. \n\n2. In [1], the authors used a similar type of straight-through estimator (essentially, the gradient of tanh instead of hard_tanh) and found that to be quite effective. You should compare to their method. Also, it's possible that SS_\\beta reduces to tanh for some choice of \\beta -- is this true?\n\n3. The use of scale factors seems to greatly increase the number of parameters in the network and thus greatly decrease the compression benefits gained by using binarization, i.e., you require essentially #scale_factors =  a constant factor times the number of actual parameters in the network (since you have a scale factor for each convolutional filter and for each column of each fully-connected layer). As a result of this, what is the actual compression multiplier that your network achieves relative to the original network?\n\n4. For the scale factor, how does yours differ from that used in Rastegari et al. (2016)? It seems the same but you claim that it is a novel contribution of your work. Please clarify.\n\n5. Why did learning \\beta not work? What was the behavior? What values of \\beta did learning settle on? \n\n6. I assume that for each layer output y_i = f(W_i x_i), the regularizer is applied as R(y_i) while at the same time y_i is passed to the next layer -- is this correct? The figures do not clearly show this and should be changed to more clearly show how the regularizer is computed and used, particularly in relation to the activation.\n\n7. In the pseudocode:\n   (a) What does \"mostly bitwise operations\" mean? Are some floating point?\n   (b) Is this the shift-based batchnorm of Hubara et al. (2016)?\n\n8. For Table 1:\n   (a) I assume these are accuracies? The caption should say.\n   (b) Why are there no comparisons to the performance of other methods on this dataset?\n   (c) Any thoughts as to why your method performs better than the full-precision method on this dataset for VGG?\n\n8. For Table 2:\n   (a) Does Table 2 show accuracies on ImageNet? You need to make this clear in the caption.\n   (b) What type of behavior do the runs that do not converge show? This seems like a learning rate problem that is easily fixable. Are there no hyperparameter values that allow it to converge?\n   (c) What behavior do you see when you use SS_1 or SS_2, i.e., \\beta = 1 or \\beta = 2? Since lower \\beta values seem better.\n   (d) The regularization seems to be the most useful contribution -- do you agree?\n   (e) Why did you not do any ablations for the scale factor? Please include these as well.\n\n9. For Table 3, did you compute the numbers for the other approaches or did you use the numbers from their papers? Each approach has its own pros and cons. Please be clear.\n\n10. Are there any plots of validation accuracy versus epoch/time for the different algorithms in order to ensure that the reported numbers were not simply cherry-picked from the run? I assume that you simply used the weights from the end of the 50th epoch -- correct? \n\n11. Is there evidence for your introductory claims that 'quantizing weights ... make neural networks harder to train due to a large number of sign fluctuations' and 'maintaining a global structure to minimize a common cost function is important' ? If so, you should cite this evidence. If not, you should make it clear that these are hypotheses. \n\n12. Why are there not more details about the particular architectures used? These should be included in the appendices to aid those who would like to rerun your experiments.

While they do not use binarized weights, other papers (see third paragraph of intro of [3] and citations within) have shown that the activation binarization causes far more accuracy loss and is thus the critical component of binarization. Further, activation binarization is orthogonal to weight binarization so it would be trivial to test their activation as well. \n\nThe issue here is that you cannot simply claim that your approach is better, even if it is more flexible (and some would argue that introducing additional hyperparameters makes training more challenging), unless you compare directly to existing work. Your experiments loosely show that lower values of \\beta outperform higher values of \\beta. You say this is not the case but provide no clear evidence for the reader. Further, you say that the bump in the swish helps with learning but, again, this is not clearly demonstrated in the experiments. Using \\beta=1 would give an STE with slope=1 at 0 (which tanh has, as used in [1]) but with the non-monotonicity that tanh does not have. This would provide a direct comparison between their approach and yours (although, even a direct comparison using \\beta=5 would be fine too).\n\nYou have introduced multiple changes to existing architectures but not clearly evaluated them to show their respective contributions and utility.

Since lower \\beta values seem better.\"\n\nLower \\beta value do not necessarily mean better results. We modified the sentence in the text\n\n\u201cLastly, it seems smaller (moderate) values of \u03b2 is better than larger values.\u201d\n\nIn theory, higher \\beta value mean better approximation of the derivative of the sign function. However, there is a trade-off between approximation of the derivative of the sign function and the gradient value. So, moderate values of \\beta seem better. So, we presented SS_5 and SS_10.\n\n   (d) \"The regularization seems to be the most useful contribution -- do you agree?\"\n\nOur contributions are incremental, like just about any contributions. E.g., ReLUs were a small modification of activation functions, yet ReLUs had a huge impact. The regularization functions introduced in this paper are two out of many functions we can use for quantizing BNN. Including the scaling factors in the regularization function. As a result, learning the scales through back-propagation is a contribution and useful since it gives a flexibility to the method to adapt to the data. Finally, based on our experimental results summarized in Table 2, our approximation of the derivative of the sign function proves to be useful empirically l since it gives better results than the straight through estimator.\n\n\n   (e) \"Why did you not do any ablations for the scale factor? Please include these as well.\"\n\nThe scaling factors are parameters estimated along with the weights. By our comparison with the BNN method we demonstrated the efficacy of using the suggested scales.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: For Table 3, did you compute the numbers for the other approaches or did you use the numbers from their papers?

Please find below a point to point response.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: How exactly is the SS_\\beta activation used? It is entirely unclear from the paper, which contradicts itself in multiple ways. Is SS_\\beta used in the forward pass at all for either the weight or activation binarization? Or is only its derivative used in the backward pass? If the latter, then you are not replacing the activation anywhere but are simply using a different straight-through estimator in place of the saturated straight-through estimator (e.g., see [1]).\n\nIn the forward pass the sign function is used, and in the backward pass we use the derivative of SwishSign function as the approximation in the backward pass. We corrected the sentence in the text:\n\n\u201cCombining both the regularization and activation ideas, we modify the training procedure by replacing the \\sign backward approximation binarization with that of the derivative of the SS_\\beta activation (2).\u201d\n\n     b) Due to the confusion introduced by this figure, we removed it accordingly.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: In [1], the authors used a similar type of straight-through estimator (essentially, the gradient of tanh instead of hard_tanh) and found that to be quite effective. You should compare to their method. Also, it's possible that SS_\\beta reduces to tanh for some choice of \\beta -- is this true?\n\n[1] is concerned with solving a combinatorial optimization problem for hard thresholding activation units. In their work they keep the weights to full precision values, and only limit the activations of units to binary values. Our primary motivation behind SS_beta was to define a class of functions for which the derivatives are different approximations of the sign function. In [1], the approximation is fixed and therefore less flexible than ours. In the ablation study, we see that for different values of beta, the accuracy changes.The SS_\\beta does not reduce to the tanh function. The tanh function is similar to that of the sigmoid, although in the case of SS_1 they look similar, in the swish function there is a subtle difference in that there is a bump at -2.4/beta and +2.4/beta which helps with learning (gradient flow, saturation at later point). Further, one of the major difference between signswish and tanh is that signswish is non monotonous.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: The use of scale factors seems to greatly increase the number of parameters in the network and thus greatly decrease the compression benefits gained by using binarization, i.e., you require essentially #scale_factors =  a constant factor times the number of actual parameters in the network (since you have a scale factor for each convolutional filter and for each column of each fully-connected layer). As a result of this, what is the actual compression multiplier that your network achieves relative to the original network?\n\nThe use of scale factors does reduce the actual compression, but not significantly. For example in the case of AlexNet, \n\nconv 64 - conv 192 - conv 384 - conv 256 - conv 256 - FC 4096 - FC 4096 \n\nThe number of parameters in the original network are ~ 6M/32 = 187500 \nThe number of scales introduced are (192+384+256+256+4096+4096) = 9280\nThe compression with the addition of scales becomes ~ 31.5\n\nThe additional overhead of the scales is less than ~2 %.\n\nAt inference time, one can fold the batch norms onto the scaling factors, thus removing the batchnorms operations and their parameters. This has the similar effect as in [2]. As a result although we introduce scaling factors, we remove the batch norm parameters and division operation.\n\n[2] Rastegari, Mohammad, et al. \"Xnor-net: Imagenet classification using binary convolutional neural networks.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.

(2016)? It seems the same but you claim that it is a novel contribution of your work. Please clarify.\n\nIn Rastegari et al. (2016) the parameters are estimated dynamically given the weights of the network. Hence in training, on each pass they are updated accordingly. Whereas in our work we introduce the scaling factors in the regularization function. \n\nThis follows as the scaling factors introduced by Rastegari et al. (2016) are estimated in a 2-stage fashion. First they find the weights and second, they solve an optimization problem (L2 norm of the difference between full-precision weights and scaling factor times binary weights) in order to estimate the scaling factors. So, the estimated scaling factor is the mean of absolute values of the weights. \n\nIn our work, there is a difference in how the scales are formulated. We introduce the scales into a regularization function constructed specifically for a BNN. This class of regularization functions can be written to \n\nR(w) = |scaling_factor - |weights| |^p \n\nwhere p=1 and 2 in the paper. Instead of having two separate optimization problems, we back-propagate the updates to the scales in order to minimize the loss function plus the regularization term.\n\nDepending on the regularization term used, the scaling factors estimation falls into either mean of absolute values of the weights (p=2) or median of absolute values of the weights (p=1). As a result, this could also be seen as a generalization of Rastegari et al. (2016)\u2019s scaling factor.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: Why did learning \\beta not work? What was the behavior? What values of \\beta did learning settle on? \n\n\nLearning beta adds only one equation to back-propagation in our experiments we fixed  beta to have explicit value. We did not extensively try to experiment with learning beta. We changed the following sentence accordingly:\n\n\u201cThe parameter $\\beta$ could be learn-able , and would add one equation only to back-propagation. However,  we fixed $\\beta$ through out our experiments. The results are summarized in Table \\ref{tab:ablation}\u201d\n\nWe did few experiments having beta trainable though it was not conclusive. Accordingly, we decided to leave it for future work. For instance one can investigate changing the beta parameter dynamically as training progresses, perhaps by starting with a smaller beta and moving towards larger beta.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: I assume that for each layer output y_i = f(W_i x_i), the regularizer is applied as R(y_i) while at the same time y_i is passed to the next layer -- is this correct? The figures do not clearly show this and should be changed to more clearly show how the regularizer is computed and used, particularly in relation to the activation.\n\nReferring to equation (6) of section 3.3, the regularizer is applied as a function of the weights and scaling factor (R(W_l, \\alpha_l)), which is then added to the loss function. This total loss is used to optimize the network. \n\nFrom section 3.3: \n\u201cJ(W, b) = L(W, b) + \\lambda \\sum_{l} R(W_l,\\alpha_l)\n\nwhere L(W, b) is the cost function, W and b are the sets of all weights and biases in the network, W_l is the set weights at layer l and \\alpha_l is the corresponding scaling factor. Here, R(.) is the regularization function 4 or 5.\u201d\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: In the pseudocode:\n   (a) What does \"mostly bitwise operations\" mean? Are some floating point?\nHere by mostly bitwise operation in algorithm 1 we mean that, the only floating operation is the multiplication of the scales, into the W^bx^b (line 6 in forward pass of algorithm 1)\n\n   (b) Is this the shift-based batchnorm of Hubara et al. (2016)?\n    No. But, shift-based batchnorm of Hubara et al. (2016) is orthogonal to our methodology. Shift-based batchnorm is only useful if you want to speed up the training.

Please find below a response to the comments.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: However, I did not get much out of Figures 3 or 4. I thought Figure 3 was unnecessary (it shows the difference between l1 and l2 regularization), and I thought the pseudo-code in Algorithm 1 was a lot clearer than Figure 4 for showing the scaling factors. \n\nRegarding figure 3, the purpose of this is to give a visualization of the regularization functions to help our non-expert readers with the intuition. We also added a dotted version of the functions to the plot depicting the effect of the scales on the functions. Further, we added a sentence in the body explaining the motivation behind designing it as such (end of pg 4) as well:\n\n\u201cThe proposed regularizing terms are inline with the wisdom of the regularization function R(w) = (1 - w^2) \\1_{\\{|w| \\leq 1\\}} as introduced in Tang et al. (2017). A primary difference are in introducing a trainable scaling factor, and formulating it such that the gradients capture appropriate sign updates to the weights. Further this regularization term does not penalize weights that are outside of [-1, +1]. One can re-define the function as to include a scaling factor R(w) = (\\alpha - w^2) \\1_{\\{|w| \\leq \\alpha\\}}. In Figure 3, we depict the different regularization terms, to help with intuition\u201d\n\nWe removed figure 4 and used the added space to add details to the discussion and experiment section.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: Algorithm 1 helped with the clarity of the approach, although it left me with a question: In section 3.3, the authors say that they train by \"replacing the sign binarization with the SS_\\beta activation\" and that they can back-propagate through it. However, in the psuedo-code it seems like they indeed use the sign-function in the forward-pass, replacing it with the signswish in the backward pass. Which is it?\n\nThank you for pointing out this issue. The pseudo-code is the correct one. We use the derivative of SwishSign function as the approximation in the backward pass as opposed to the straight through estimator. We corrected the sentence in the text pg.5:\n\n\u201cCombining both the regularization and activation ideas, we modify the training procedure by replacing the sign backward approximation with that of the derivative of SS_B activation (\\ref{sswish}).\u201d\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*comment: \u201cThey modify it by centering it and taking the derivative. I'm not sure I understand the intuition behind using the derivative of the Swish as the new activation. It's also unclear how much of BNN+'s success is due to the modification of the Swish function over using the original Swish activation. For this reason I would've liked to see results with just fitting the Swish.\u201d \n\nThe activation function of a BNN is the sign function. The original swish function resembles that of Relu and is not a valid approximation for the sign function as it does not saturate on the right side hence we did not experiment with this function. In training binary networks, there is a discrepancy between the forward pass and backward pass. With the modifications made to the Swish, we attempt to close this gap. One interesting property of this function is it captures gradients over a larger domain as opposed to the straight through estimator (STE) where it immediately reaches zero.\n\nIn our experiments we compared with the htan backward approximation, which is the valid alternative that is being used in the literature.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: \u201cThe fact that some of the architectures did not converge is a bit concerning. It's an important detail if a training method is unstable, so I would've liked to see more discussion of this instability.\u201d \n\nTable 2 is a computationally time consuming task, as we are training the networks on the ImageNet dataset, with limited resources on two different architectures. The total number of experiments are 20. As a result, for those two specific table values our experiments had not terminated by the submission deadline. This sentence hadn\u2019t been worded appropriately. Also we would like to point that we have not experienced any convergence issues with the method. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: \u201cThe bolding on Table 2 is misleading\u201d\n    \nWe removed the boldings from table 2 and instead emphasize them in table 3.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1074/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1074/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1074/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BNN+: Improved Binary Network Training", "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are widely used in many applications.

We thought it\u2019d be interesting to point this out, and by this we meant that by increasing beta, one can adjust the locations at which the gradients start saturating.

(2017). The authors parameterize the regularization term by a scale that is similar to one introduced by Rastegari et al. (2016). As far as I can tell, these are the main novel contributions of the authors' approach\n\nThe notion of regularization as well as that of scaling factors are not new in the literature of binary neural networks (BNN). But, the regularization introduced in Tang et al. (2017) is different from ours because it does not penalize the weights outside of [-1;1], it is a quadratic function (1 - w^2) and does not include the notion of scaling factor. For the scaling factors introduced by Rastegari et al. (2016), they estimate them in a 2-stage fashion. They first find the weights and second, they solve an optimization function (L2 norm of the difference between full-precision weights and scaling factor times binary weights) in order to estimate the scaling factors. This results in the scaling factor is the mean of absolute values of the weights.\n\nIn our work, we introduce a new approach to the quantization of BNNs. Our novelty is the introduction of the scaling factor into a regularization function constructed for a BNN (class of regularization functions R(w) = |scaling_factor - |weights| |^p where p=1 and 2 in the paper) , as well as an adaptive approximation (using a parameter) of the derivative of the sign function. Instead of having two separate optimization problems, we only need back-propagation in order to minimize the loss function plus the regularization term in order to estimate the binary weights as well as the scaling factors. Depending on the regularization term used, the scaling factors estimation falls into either mean of absolute values of the weights (p=2) or median of absolute values of the weights (p=1). \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n*comment: The authors don't provide much intuition for why the new activation function is superior to the swish (even including the swish in Figure 2 could improve this). Moreover, they mention that training is unstable without explaining more. \n\nI believe we addressed this in prior comments. There is no new activation function but a new approximation of the sign function derivative. Hence, the swish function is not appropriate, but our modification is. We point out the relationship with the swish function is due to our SignSwish function being modification to the derivative of the swish function.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1074/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1074/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1074/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "BNN+: Improved Binary Network Training", "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are widely used in many applications.

However, their deployment on edge devices has been difficult because they are resource hungry. Binary neural networks (BNN) help to alleviate the prohibitive resource requirements of DNN, where both activations and weights are limited to 1-bit. We propose an improved binary training method (BNN+), by introducing a regularization function that encourages training weights around binary values. In addition to this, to enhance model performance we add trainable scaling factors in our regularization functions. Furthermore, we use an improved approximation of the derivative of the $\\sign$ activation function in the backward computation. These additions are based on linear operations that are easily implementable into the binary training framework and we show experimental results on CIFAR-10 obtaining an accuracy of 86.5%, on AlexNet and 91.3% with VGG network. On ImageNet, our method also outperforms the traditional BNN method and XNOR-net, using AlexNet by a margin of 4% and 2% top-1 accuracy respectively.\u201d\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*comment: \"The proposed method for training BNNs in Section 3 is designed by combining or modifying some existing techniques, such as regularized training and approximated gradient. Thus, the novelty of this paper is somewhat weak.\"\n\nMain contributions of this paper are as follows: \nSuggesting regularization functions that encourage training binary weights\nEmbedding trainable scaling factors in the regularization function\nAdaptive backward approximation to the sign derivative\nAdmittedly, the notion of regularization as well as that of approximation of the derivative are not new in the literature of binary neural networks (BNN). But, the regularization introduced until then is different from ours because it does not penalize the weights greater than 1 or smaller than -1, also the fact that it is a quadratic function (1 - w^2 in [1]) and does not include a scaling factor. For the gradient approximation,  to the best of our knowledge, there is no adaptive function capable of approximating the derivative of the sign function. Indeed, STE and the one proposed in [2] are both arbitrarily chosen and are fixed approximations. Thus, our novelty is the introduction of the scaling factor into a regularization function constructed for a BNN (class of regularization functions R(w) = |scaling_factor - |weights| |^p where p=1 and 2 in the paper) , as well as an adaptive approximation (using a parameter) of the derivative of the sign function. Hence, using back-propagation, the binary weights and scaling factors are learned using only one objective function.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*comment: \"Fcn.3 is a complex function for deep neural networks, which integrates three terms of x. I am worried about the convergence of the proposed method.\"\n    \nThe function can be simplified to take on this form: tanh(beta x / 2) + (beta x / 2) sech^2(beta x / 2).

Their approach is to quantize weights, i.e. rounding weights and hidden units so they can be evaluated using bit operations. There are many challenges in this approach, namely that one cannot back-propagate through discrete weights or discrete sign functions. The authors introduce an approximation of the sign function, which they call the SignSwish, and they back-propagate through this, quantizing the weights during the forward pass. Further, they introduce a regularization term to encourage weights to be around learned scales. They evaluate on CIFAR-10 and Imagenet, surpassing most other quantization methods. \n\nThe paper is pretty clear throughout. The authors do a good job of motivating the problem and placing their approach in the context of previous work. I found Figures 1 and 2 helpful for understanding previous work and the SignSwish activation function, respectively. However, I did not get much out of Figures 3 or 4. I thought Figure 3 was unnecessary (it shows the difference between l1 and l2 regularization), and I thought the psuedo-code in Algorithm 1 was a lot clearer than Figure 4 for showing the scaling factors. Algorithm 1 helped with the clarity of the approach, although it left me with a question: In section 3.3, the authors say that they train by \"replacing the sign binarization with the SS_\\beta activation\" and that they can back-propagate through it. However, in the psuedo-code it seems like they indeed use the sign-function in the forward-pass, replacing it with the signswish in the backward pass. Which is it?\n\nThe original aspects of their approach are in introducing a new continuous approximation to the sign function and introducing learnable scales for l1 and l2 regularization. The new activation function, the SignSwish, is based off the Swish-activation from Ramachandran et al. (2018). They modify it by centering it and taking the derivative. I'm not sure I understand the intuition behind using the derivative of the Swish as the new activation. It's also unclear how much of BNN+'s success is due to the modification of the Swish function over using the original Swish activation. For this reason I would've liked to see results with just fitting the Swish. In terms of their regularization, they point out that their L2 regularization term is a generalization of the one introduced in Tang et al. (2017). The authors parameterize the regularization term by a scale that is similar to one introduced by Rastegari et al. (2016). As far as I can tell, these are the main novel contributions of the authors' approach. \n\nThis paper's main selling point isn't originality -- rather, it's that their combination of tweaks lead to state-of-the-art results. Their methods come very close to AlexNet and VGG in terms of top-1 and top-5 CIFAR10 accuracy (with the BNN+ VGG even eclipsing the full-precision VGG top-1 accuracy). When applied to ImageNet, BNN+ outperforms most of the other methods by a good margin, although there is still a lot of room between the BNN+ and full-precision accuracies. The fact that some of the architectures did not converge is a bit concerning. It's an important detail if a training method is unstable, so I would've liked to see more discussion of this instability. The authors don't compare their method to the Bi-Real Net from Liu et al. (2018) since it introduces a shortcut connection to the architecture, although the Bi-Real net is SOTA for Resnet-18 on Imagenet. Did you try implementing the shortcut connection in your architecture? \n\nSome more minor points:\n- The bolding on Table 2 is misleading. It makes it seem like BNN+ has the best top-5 accuracy for Resnet-18, although XNOR-net is in fact superior. \n- It's unclear to me why the zeros of the derivative of sign swish being at +/- 2.4beta means that when beta is larger, we get a closer approximation to the sign function. The derivative of the sign function is zero almost everywhere, so what's the connection?\n- Is the initialization of alpha a nice trick, or is it necessary for stable optimization? Experiments on the importance of alpha initialization would've been nice. \n\nPROS:\n- Results. The top-1 and top-5 accuracies for CIFAR10 and Imagenet are SOTA for binarized neural networks.\n- Importance of problem. Reducing the size of neural networks is an important direction of research in terms of machine learning applications. There is still a lot to be explored.\n- Clarity: The paper is generally clear throughout.\n\nCONS:\n-Originality. The contributions are an activation function that's a modification of the swish activation, along with parameterized l1 and l2 regularization. \n-Explanation. The authors don't provide much intuition for why the new activation function is superior to the swish (even including the swish in Figure 2 could improve this). Moreover, they mention that training is unstable without explaining more.

However, their deployment on edge devices has been difficult because they are resource hungry. Binary neural networks (BNN) help to alleviate the prohibitive resource requirements of DNN, where both activations and weights are limited to 1-bit. We propose an improved binary training method (BNN+), by introducing a regularization function that encourages training weights around binary values. In addition to this, to enhance model performance we add trainable scaling factors to our regularization functions. Furthermore, we use an improved approximation of the derivative of the sign activation function in the backward computation. These additions are based on linear operations that are easily implementable into the binary training framework.
