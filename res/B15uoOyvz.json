This work shows that a ResNet trained on this task can predict these parameters (and proposes a spherical CNN but does not yet have results).\n\nPros:\n- Paper is fairly well communicated.\n- Using deep learning to improve analysis of physical observations is an exciting topic.\n\nCons:\n- The work is very preliminary. All the predictions are on a simple task with simulated data, and for parameters which we have very good existing methods.\n- While the domain is interesting, there is no novelty in the methods or insights applicable to other domains. ICLR attendees will not be surprised that ResNets were capable of solving what amounts to a simple image regression task.\n- The proposal to extend these methods to more complex analysis where we do not have such strong priors is not fleshed out in any detail.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background with Deep Learning", "abstract": "The observation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has been one of the cornerstones in establishing the current understanding of the Universe.
