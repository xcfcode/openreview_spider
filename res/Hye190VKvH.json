The manuscript discusses a metric-learning formulation as a quotient for reconstruction-error terms, how to optimize the quotient based on results from Wang et 2014, an iterated reweighted approach to circumvent the non-smooth part of the l1 loss in zero, and experiments on brain images of Alzeimer's disease.\n\nMy two main issues with the manuscript is that the theoretical part is written very imprecisely and that the experiments are not convincing due to the lack of good baselines and of statistical power.\n\nWith regards to the theoretical contributions, a fraction of the results in the present manuscript are trivial consequences or Wang2014, and yet it comes with errors in the statements. For instance, in equation (9), the present manuscript writes greater or equal, while I believe that it should be strictly greater, as in Wang. Theorem 1 and 4 seem almost the same thing, though with a contradiction between the two. Other statements are inaccurate: the authors claim some results on reaching global optima, while I believe that they can only claim that they reach stationary points. Theorem 2 and 5 seem to be the same thing.\n\nConcerning the iterated reweighted approach, I believe that this is non smooth only for g(x)=0, which is not covered by the theorems of Wang 2014. Is this algorithm needed? Note that Wang apply their algorithm with an l1 norm, ie non-smooth in zero, and do not report problems with out. The manuscript mentions that \"to inverted matrices that divide 0s, which routinely lead to inferior learning performance.\". I am not exactly sure what that means and I would need to understand better the problem. Also, the theoretical contribution that with the added the delta the algortihm converges, seems quite trivial: it seems to me that it is the eta trick.\n\nMinor comments: in algorithm 3, it would be useful to write the full expression of the equations, rather than just reference the numbers. Also, the computational cost of the eigenvectors at each iteration seems quite prohibitive.\n\nHow was the value r=3 selected?\n\nFigure 2 seem to choose that approaches have not converged: they final value is larger than intermediate values?\n\nHow were the p-values between cross-validation assessment of estimators computed? If it was done using standard paired t-test, this is incorrect are the folds are not independent.\n\nWith regards to the experiments, I worry that the model is not compared against simple baselines, such as a PCA."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1268/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1268/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["selbeleidy@mymail.mines.edu", "lyujianlu@mines.edu", "laurenzoebaker@mymail.mines.edu", "huawangcs@gmail.com", "feipingnie@gmail.com"], "title": "Longitudinal Enrichment of Imaging Biomarker Representations for Improved Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis", "authors": ["Saad Elbeleidy", "Lyujian Lu", "L.

It is out of the area of my expertise, but the innovation of combining the PCA and LPP to produce the dimensionally reduced representation of the longitudinal data seems not significant enough, especially when the author did not mention why they chose these two methods out of all the available projection/hashing approaches.\n\n2. The paper is poorly written. Theorem 1 and Theorem 4 state the opposite conditions for v. Theorem  2 and Theorem 5 are exactly the same. If the same theorem has already been proved by previous work [Wang et al., 2014], it is not necessary to prove it again in this paper. The most important theorem which is claimed as the theoretical contribution of this paper (i.e. Theorem 6) did not even appear in the main contents but only in the appendix. The proof of theorems in appendix, Proof A.1, A.2, A.3 did not state which theorem they are corresponding to and are organized in different order as Theorem 3-5, make it hard to read.\n\n3. There are many grammar errors and sentences which are not consistent with English writing conventions. E.g. \u201cThis problem is heavily studied with (Wang et al., 2012; Brand et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018) as example approaches which, despite their effectiveness, present an added complexity to the problem.\u201d is better written as \u201cThis problem is excessively studied by (Wang et al., 2012; Brand et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018) as example approaches which, despite their effectiveness, present an additional complexity to the problem\u201d; \u201c... to provide value in predicting patients\u2019 diagnosis.\u201d is better written as \u201c... to provide valuable information in ...\u201d; \u201c... , we focus AD diagnosis from MRI scans ...\u201d should be \u201c... , we focus on AD diagnosis from MRI scans ...\u201d; \u201cconsider outliers\u201d is better as \u201chandle outliers\u201d; etc. \n\n4.

Early detection of AD can significantly improve or extend a patient's life so it is critical to use all available information about patients. \nWe propose an unsupervised method to learn a consistent representation by utilizing inconsistent data through minimizing the ratio of $p$-Order Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). Our method's representation can outperform the use of consistent data alone and does not require the use of complex tensor-specific approaches. We run experiments on patient data from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which consists of inconsistent data, to predict patients' diagnosis.", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "elbeleidy|longitudinal_enrichment_of_imaging_biomarker_representations_for_improved_alzheimers_disease_diagnosis", "original_pdf": "/attachment/37247ef33234763a9ea4d097404d0b68d275ac4f.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nelbeleidy2020longitudinal,\ntitle={Longitudinal Enrichment of Imaging Biomarker Representations for Improved Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis},\nauthor={Saad Elbeleidy and Lyujian Lu and L.
