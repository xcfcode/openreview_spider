See also the answers to clarity questions to reviewer 1. \nThe role of optimal control in this paper is two-fold. First, it can be seen as a general formulation, as we develop in Section 2.2, of adversarial training with hyper-parameters in the inner loop. This is not limited to PGD. Second, we use approximate criterion (Eq. 13 and 14) derived from the maximum principle in optimal control to quantify the approximate optimality of adversarial training algorithms, including the one proposed in this paper.\n\nOn other annealing(decay) schedules:\nFinding better annealing(decay) scheme is an interesting future direction. However, using more complex schemes may introduce extra parameters, while one of the major challenges for machine learning methods to be practically useful for industry practitioners is the complexity of the method. We tried another exponential scheme K _{t}=K_{min} +  (K_{max}-K_{min})* (1-exp^{-eta * t})/(1-exp^{-eta*T}), where K_{t} is the number of PGD adversarial training steps at t-th epoch, K_{min} is the minimum number of PGD steps in the beginning, K_{max} is the maximum number of PGD steps in the last epoch, eta is the hyper-parameter controlling the shape of the scheme. This design ensures that when t=0 K_{t} = K_{min}, when t = T, K_{t} = K_{max} to make it comparable with the linear scheme used in our paper. However, we tried different parameters of eta ranging from  0.1 to 5, but did not find performance improvements. The results are shown in Appendix B.5. We will try experiments on the large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, in our future work because of our current limited computational facility.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["yn272@cam.ac.uk", "qianxiao@nus.edu.sg", "zhanxing.zhu@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Amata: An Annealing Mechanism for Adversarial Training Acceleration", "authors": ["Nanyang Ye", "Qianxiao Li", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "pdf": "/pdf/55c5a2001a7fbfa471ff85c4c32470b0a82bc585.pdf", "TL;DR": "Amata: a simple modification to PGD reduces the adversarial training time to 1/2~1/3.", "abstract": "Despite of the empirical success in various domains, it has been revealed that deep neural networks are vulnerable to maliciously perturbed input data that much degrade their performance.

In this paper, we have provided a simple yet effective mechanism to accelerate the adversarial training with only a few lines of code. The optimality of the proposed method is numerically justified with a criterion based on the optimal control theory.\n\nBelow, we summarize the revision briefly. Detailed responses to each reviewer/comment are followed based on each reviewer feedback.\n1.Clarification on novelty:\nAlthough both optimal control methodologies are used in this work and [LH18], the formulation of the optimal control problem is fundamentally different. The latter is interested in developing a control viewpoint of deep neural networks idealized as a dynamical system, where as the current work formulates the adversarial training problem as a control problem. \nThe only overlap is the mathematical tools used. Details are given below, and we have also added some clarifications in the paper on this point. \n2.Clarification on the importance of optimal control formulation:\nThe proposed modification is analyzed by optimal control theory to quantify its deviation  from optimality through the derived criterion C, which is shown to be small for our method. The optimal control analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that though simple, the proposed mechanism is effective for accelerating adversarial training without sacrificing the robustness.\n3.Combination of other acceleration methods:\nWe show an example combining the Amata and YOPO in the Appendix B.3. The additional example shows that our method can be easily incorporated within other methods, such as YOPO, to further reduce almost 50 percent of the computation time and achieve even better performance when converged.\n4.Other annealing(decay) schemes, such as exponential scheme:\nWe added additional experiments on other annealing(decay) schemes, such as an exponential scheme. The results do not out-perform the current scheme. We do not claim that the current simple scheme is optimal, but to develop more complex schemes one would probably have to appeal to more sophisticated tools, such as adaptive or control based methods. Our current approach emphasizes simplicity, and we show both in terms of the optimal control criterion and experiments that they perform adequately well. \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["yn272@cam.ac.uk", "qianxiao@nus.edu.sg", "zhanxing.zhu@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Amata: An Annealing Mechanism for Adversarial Training Acceleration", "authors": ["Nanyang Ye", "Qianxiao Li", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "pdf": "/pdf/55c5a2001a7fbfa471ff85c4c32470b0a82bc585.pdf", "TL;DR": "Amata: a simple modification to PGD reduces the adversarial training time to 1/2~1/3.", "abstract": "Despite of the empirical success in various domains, it has been revealed that deep neural networks are vulnerable to maliciously perturbed input data that much degrade their performance.

However, our formulation clearly provides a principled way for designing fast adversarial training method that is open for future research.\n\n\nContrasting with [LH18] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01299)\nAlthough both optimal control methodologies are used in this work and [LH18], they are fundamentally very different settings:\nTime dimension and state for the dynamics: [LH18] studies dynamics of transformation of hidden states in deep learning, and the role of the  time dimension is played by the layers. The states are the hidden activations in a deep neural network. In this work, the time dimension is the outer-loop (SGD)  iterations in adversarial training, and the states which are evolving in time are the weights of the neural network as training proceeds.\nControl variables: [LH18] basically generalizes the back-propagation algorithm for training neural networks through the PMP. The control variables are the weights in the neural network. In this work, the control variables are the hyper-parameters for adversarial training.\nIn other words, the only similarity between this work and [LH18] is that both use optimal control ideas (but the same can be said about any work that uses optimal control or related techniques in calculus of variations). We have clarified this point briefly in the revised manuscript after the reference of  [LH18] on the MSA algorithm.\n\n\nOther questions:\nPGD-40 is a suitably strong attack for evaluation that is used in other papers. We also tried other numbers of iterations, such as PGD-20 and PGD-60.  The results are similar and are shown in Appendix B.4.\n\nRandom restarts were used for PGD.  It seems that random starts will not have large effects on the results (https://github.com/MadryLab/mnist_challenge/issues/6).\n\nClarity issues raised:\n\u201c-Significance: The technique AMATA itself, is a heuristic to gradually increase the length of the inner loop optimization in adversarial training. It is unrelated to the optimal control formulation.\u201d\nAs commented by Reviewer 2, The proposed modification is analyzed by the optimal control theory to check its optimality, quantified by the derived . The optimal control analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that though simple, the proposed mechanism is effective for accelerating adversarial training without sacrificing the robustness.\n\n\u201c- Please provide references for the optimal control formulation in 2.2.\u201d\nThe formulation in 2.2 is part of the original work in this paper. This is made clear in contribution 2 in the introduction. The control theoretic tools such as the Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principles have already been cited. \n\u201c- Some references to variables in the text are not made precise by identifying the variable in question (e.g.: \"a set of optimal parameter choices\"; \"requires information on the entire training interval\").\u201d\nin our specific application, these are the optimal choices of inner-loop hyper-parameters as the training proceeds. We have added this clarification in the revision.\n\u201c- The function of the hyperparameters \\alpha, \\gamma, K are not well discussed in Section 2.4.\u201d\n\\alpha is the step-size, \\gamma is the computational cost of each PGD step and K is the number of PGD steps per outer iteration. These information are shown in Alg. 1, but for clarity we added additional explanation of these in section 2.4.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["yn272@cam.ac.uk", "qianxiao@nus.edu.sg", "zhanxing.zhu@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Amata: An Annealing Mechanism for Adversarial Training Acceleration", "authors": ["Nanyang Ye", "Qianxiao Li", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "pdf": "/pdf/55c5a2001a7fbfa471ff85c4c32470b0a82bc585.pdf", "TL;DR": "Amata: a simple modification to PGD reduces the adversarial training time to 1/2~1/3.", "abstract": "Despite of the empirical success in various domains, it has been revealed that deep neural networks are vulnerable to maliciously perturbed input data that much degrade their performance.

The authors claim that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance as the original PGD adversarial training with less time. \n\nFirst I think this mechanism itself's contribution is kind of incremental because this technique is well under the PGD adversarial training framework. In fact, there are existing works trying to accelerate adversarial training, for example [1]. I think the authors may need to compare their proposed method with [1] if possible.\n\nI like the optimal control formulation in 2.2 and 2.3. More discussion on (8) would be welcomed. In particularly, I think the authors implicitly define the training cost as the sum of iterations in all PGD attacks and turn it into an integral. More explanation here would help. Also, it seems that the reason why \\alpha=\\frac{\\tau}{K^t} is not fully explained in the paper. The authors choose to fix the total step length of PGD. Is this a heuristics?\n\nIn the experimental part, I think it would be better to also report the number of SGD steps on \\theta to get a sense of convergence.

This paper proposes a simple modification for adversarial training in order to improve the robustness of the algorithms. The adversarial training of the neural networks involve two steps: the outer loop where the loss is being minimized, the inner loop where the adversarial examples are being found by using PGD. The inner PGD optimization makes training more expensive, because for every gradient step, algorithm needs to perform several steps of PGD. This paper proposes a simple modification to the PGD that is being used in the inner loop. The proposed modification involves the increasing the number of adversarial training steps and decreasing the adversarial training step size gradually as the training proceeds. Then, they analyze the modifications from the theory of optimal control. Their experiments show that their method can achieve similar robustness to the other existing approaches with less computations.\n\nPros: \n - Interesting topic, important subject and a very simple approach.\n - Significant improvements in terms of training times.\n\nCons: \n- The math notation is a bit cumbersome, lots of undefined variables and functions used without properly giving enough background to the readers. This field is still new not every reader might be familiar with the optimal control theory or the common notation that is being used there. Please try to explain the equations and theorems more carefully.\n- Experiments are only on small-scale toy-datasets like CIFAR10 and MNIST.\n\nComplete Assessment: I like the proposed approach, in this paper. It is a fairly simple approach and seems to work well in practice, at least on the tasks that the authors have tried. The writing, I think still needs some work, some of the math notation is mostly not properly explained, in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Overall, I am not sure how much those two sections are actually contributing to the paper.\n\nQuestion: Did you try using a different annealing mechanisms, besides linear decaying, such as an exponential one?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper634/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["yn272@cam.ac.uk", "qianxiao@nus.edu.sg", "zhanxing.zhu@pku.edu.cn"], "title": "Amata: An Annealing Mechanism for Adversarial Training Acceleration", "authors": ["Nanyang Ye", "Qianxiao Li", "Zhanxing Zhu"], "pdf": "/pdf/55c5a2001a7fbfa471ff85c4c32470b0a82bc585.pdf", "TL;DR": "Amata: a simple modification to PGD reduces the adversarial training time to 1/2~1/3.", "abstract": "Despite of the empirical success in various domains, it has been revealed that deep neural networks are vulnerable to maliciously perturbed input data that much degrade their performance.

Numerical experiments on standard datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR10, show that our method can achieve similar or even better robustness with around 1/3 to 1/2 computation time compared with PGD.", "keywords": [], "paperhash": "ye|amata_an_annealing_mechanism_for_adversarial_training_acceleration", "original_pdf": "/attachment/41cbf36cd28ed51d0234b440338a34fe27bf9df0.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nye2020amata,\ntitle={Amata: An Annealing Mechanism for Adversarial Training Acceleration},\nauthor={Nanyang Ye and Qianxiao Li and Zhanxing Zhu},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1xI_TEtwS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
