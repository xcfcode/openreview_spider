In previous work, it is widely acknowledged that the KL-term plays an important role in posterior collapse. However, in this paper, the authors show theoretically that even the marginal log-likelihood itself could have spurious local optima and for linear VAEs, the ELBO does not add any additional optima to the pPCA model. Experimental results on posterior collapse in non-linear VAEs provide evidence to the analysis. \n\nThe analysis in this paper presents a complementary view in helping us better understand posterior collapse. One thing which is not clear to me in the current analysis is how posterior collapse can happen to pPCA if it has the same spurious local optima. Another minor comment is on the MNIST dataset, given the data is practically binary, I wonder if that would also contribute to the preference of having a smaller \\sigma. Finally, it would be interesting if the authors could also comment on VAEs with other observational model rather than Gaussian (e.g., Multinomial, as in Krishnan et al. 2018, On the challenges of learning with inference networks on sparse, high-dimensional data).
