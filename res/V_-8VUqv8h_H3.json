The assumption behind this model is that such an intermediate\r\nsmooth representation might help the classification, especially in the case where the number of sentiment classes is rather large (32) as it is studied here.\r\n\r\nThe idea of modeling the relationship between emotions labels (Y) and\r\ndocuments (X, encoded using bag-of-words) via an intermediate\r\nrepresentation (Z) is appealing and seems to be a good direction to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe main idea of the present model is to build a kind of two-layers\r\nnetwork(X->Z->Y), where each layers has its own architecture and learning\r\nprocess and is trained in a (weakly) supervised way. Unfortunately, it is not\r\nexactly clear how this training works. On one hand, the layer X->Z is trained via maximum likelihood, setting the supervision on Z via least-square regression for Z->Y (X and Y are known). But on the other hand, it is written that the layer Z->Y is obtained via MDS or kernel PCA. This is a bit puzzling.\r\n\r\nI also think that the dimension of the manifold (l) should be given.\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of references (maybe due to the page limit) Still,\r\n(Glorot et al., ICML11), (Chen et al., ICML12) or (Socher et al.,\r\nEMNLP11) should be discussed since all these papers presents neural\r\nnetwork archiecture for sentiment analysis and basically learn an\r\nintermediate representation of documents.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- interesting setting with weak supervision\r\n- new data\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- many unclear points\r\n- lack references"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Manifold of Human Emotions", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis predicts the presence of positive or negative emotions in a text document.

The paper uses a novel dataset of >1 million blog posts (livejournal) using 32 emoticons as labels. The model uses a Gaussian latent variable to embed bag of words documents into a vector space shaped by the emoticon labels. Experiments on the blog dataset demonstrate the latent vector representations of documents are better than bag of words for multiclass sentiment classification.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused as to how the inference procedure works. The conditional distribution P(Z|X) is Gaussian as is P(Z|Y), but the graphical structure suggests P(Y|Z) needs to be given and a Gaussian doesn't make sense here as Y is a binary vector. More generally, given the description in the paper I don't understand how to implement the proposed model. A more detailed description of the model itself and the inference procedure could help here.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of recent work on representation learning for sentiment. No discussion of related models or comparisons to other work are given. In particular, recursive neural networks (e.g. Socher et al EMNLP 2011) have been used to learn document vector representations for multi-dimensional sentiment. Additionally, Maas et al (ACL 2011) introduce a benchmark dataset and similar latent-variable graphical model for sentiment representations. Overall, I think substantially more discussion of previous work is necessary. The two citations given aren't reflective of much of the recent work on learning text representations or sentiment.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n- The proposed dataset sounds interesting and could advance representation learning for multi-dimensional sentiment analysis\r\n- The proposed model is very unclear. With the current explanation I am unable to verify its correctness\r\n- Practically no discussion of the large amount of previous work on learning representations for text and sentiment"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Manifold of Human Emotions", "decision": "conferencePoster-iclr2013-workshop", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis predicts the presence of positive or negative emotions in a text document.
