Training RNN's in an online fashion (with no backpropagation through time) is one of those problems which are not well explored in the research community. And I think, this paper approaches this problem in a very principled manner. The authors proposes to use forward approach for the calculation of the gradients. The author proposes to modify RTRL by maintaining a rank one approximation of jacobian matrix (derivative of state w.r.t parameters)  which was done in NoBackTrack Paper. The way I think this paper is different from NoBackTrack Paper is that this version can be implemented in a black box fashion and hence easy to implement using current DL libraries like Pytorch. \n\nPros.\n\n- Its an interesting paper, very easy to follow, and with proper literature survey.\n\nCons:\n\n- The results are quite preliminary. I'll note that this is a very difficult problem.\n- \"The proof of UORO\u2019s convergence to a local optimum is soon to be published Masse & Ollivier (To appear).\"  I think, paper violates the anonymity.  So, I'd encourage the authors to remove this. \n\nSome Points: \n\n- I find the argument of stochastic gradient descent wrong (I could be wrong though). RNN's follow the markov property (wrt hidden states from previous time step and the current input) so from time step t to t+1, if you change the parameters, the hidden state at time t (and all the time steps before) would carry stale information unless until you're using something like eligibility traces from RL literature. I also don't know how to overcome this issue. \n\n- I'd be worried about the variance in the estimate of rank one approximation. All the experiments carried out by the authors are small scale (hidden size = 64). I'm curious if authors tried experimenting with larger networks, I'd guess it wont perform well due to the high variance in the approximation. I'd like to see an experiment with hidden size  = 128/256/512/1024. My intuition is that because of high variance it would be difficult to train this network, but I could be wrong. I'm curious what the authors had to say about this. \n\n- If the variance of the approximation is indeed high, can we use something to control the dynamics of the network which can result in less variance. Have authors thought about this ? \n\n- I'd also like to see experiments on copying task/adding task (as these are standard experiments which are done for analysis of long term dependencies) \n\n- I'd also like to see what effect the length of sequence has on the approximation. As small errors in approximation on each step can compound giving rise to chaotic dynamics. (small change in input => large change in output)\n\n- I'd also like to know how using UORO changes the optimization as compared to Back-propagation through time in the sense, does the two approaches would reach same local minimum ? or is there a possibility that the former can reach \"less\" number of potential local minimas as compared to BPTT. \n\n\nI'm tempted to give high score for this paper( Score - 7) , as it is unexplored direction in our research community, and I think this paper makes a very useful contribution to tackle this problem in a very principled way.  But I'd like some more experiments to be done (which I have mentioned above), failing to do those experiments, I'd be forced to reduce the score (to score - 5) ", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization", "abstract": "The novel \\emph{Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization} (UORO) algorithm allows for online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent network models.

We have tried to attend your concerns in the revised version of the paper. \n\n1/ As you pointed out, the results are indeed preliminary. As pointed out in the answer to Reviewer 2, it is difficult to obtain results competitive with BPTT on large scale benchmarks given the additional constraints on UORO (namely, no storage of past data, and good convergence properties, which is not the case of truncated backpropagation if dependencies exceed its truncation range).\n\n2/ About the variance of UORO for large networks: We have added an experiment to test this. The variance of UORO does increase with netowrk size (probably sublinearly), and larger networks will require smaller learning rates.\n\n3/ About the effect of length on the quality of the approximation: We have added an experiment to test the evolution of UORO variance when time increases along the input sequence. The variance of UORO does not explode over time, and is stationary.  A key point of UORO is the whole renormalization process (variable rho), designed precisely for this. An independent, theoretical proof for the similar case of NoBackTrack is in (Masse 2017).  Thus UORO is applicable to unbounded sequences (notably, in the experiments, datasets are fed as a single sequence, containing 10^6-10^7 characters). \n\n4/ About the stochastic gradient descent argument: indeed one has to be careful. If UORO is used to process a number of finite training sequences, and gradient steps are performed at the end of each sequence only, then this is a fully standard SGD argument: UORO computes, in a streaming fashion, an unbiased estimate of the same gradient as BPTT for each training sequence.  However, if the gradients steps are performed at every time step, as we do here, then you are right that an additional argument is needed. The difference between applying gradients at each step and applying gradients only at the end of each sequence is at *second order* in the learning rate: if the learning rate is small, applying gradients at each time does not change the computations too much, and the SGD argument applies up to second-order terms.  This is fully formalized in (Masse 2017). If moreover, only one infinite training sequence is provided, then an additional assumption of ergodicity (decay of correlations) is needed. But in any case unbiasedness is the central property.\n\n5/ About the optima reached by UORO vs BPTT: in the limit of very small learning rates, UORO, RTRL, and BPTT with increasing truncation lengths will all produce the same limit trajectories. The theory from (Masse 2017) proves local convergence to the *same* set of local optima for RTRL and UORO (if starting close enough to the local optimum). On the other hand, for large learning rates, we are not aware of theoretical results for any recurrent algorithm.\n\n6/ Regarding reference (Masse 2017): this reference is now publically\navailable and we provide a link in the bibliography. We were indeed aware of Masse's work a bit before it was put online, but that still covers many people, so we do not believe this breaks anonymity. Our paper is disjoint from (Masse 2017), as can be directly checked by comparing the texts.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization", "abstract": "The novel \\emph{Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization} (UORO) algorithm allows for online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent network models.

Such datasets (notably next-character or next-word predictions) contain difficult short-term dependencies: Truncated BPTT with relatively small truncation is expected to learn those dependencies better than an algorithm like UORO, which must consider all time ranges at once.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization", "abstract": "The novel \\emph{Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization} (UORO) algorithm allows for online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent network models. It works in a streaming fashion and avoids backtracking through past activations and inputs. UORO is computationally as costly as \\emph{Truncated Backpropagation Through Time} (truncated BPTT), a widespread algorithm for online learning of recurrent networks \\cite{jaeger2002tutorial}.  UORO is a modification of \\emph{NoBackTrack} \\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/OllivierC15} that bypasses the need for model sparsity and makes implementation easy in current deep learning frameworks, even for complex models.  Like NoBackTrack, UORO provides unbiased gradient estimates; unbiasedness is the core hypothesis in stochastic gradient descent theory, without which convergence to a local optimum is not guaranteed. On the contrary, truncated BPTT does not provide this property, leading to possible divergence.  On synthetic tasks where truncated BPTT is shown to diverge, UORO converges. For instance, when a parameter has a positive short-term but negative long-term influence, truncated BPTT diverges unless the truncation span is very significantly longer than the intrinsic temporal range of the interactions, while UORO performs well thanks to the unbiasedness of its gradients.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/f62e3b51de771fad3829cd4234c48da4a1764b04.pdf", "TL;DR": "Introduces an online, unbiased and easily implementable gradient estimate for recurrent models.", "paperhash": "tallec|unbiased_online_recurrent_optimization", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\ntallec2018unbiased,\ntitle={Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization},\nauthor={Corentin Tallec and Yann Ollivier},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJQDjk-0b},\n}", "keywords": ["RNN"], "authors": ["Corentin Tallec", "Yann Ollivier"], "authorids": ["corentin.tallec@polytechnique.edu", "yann@yann-ollivier.org"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1516825732362, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper514/Official_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "rJQDjk-0b", "writers": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/AnonReviewer[0-9]+|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Authors|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Area_Chair|ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper514/Area_Chair", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "cdate": 1516825732362}}}], "count": 10}
