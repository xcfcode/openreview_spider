The reviewers found the paper is generally clear to read.\n\nCons:\nWhile the paper doesn't have a major flaw, the overall impact and novelty of the paper are considered to be relatively marginal. Even after the rebuttal, none of the reviewers felt compelled to increase their score. One point that came up multiple times is that the paper treats the source code as flat text and does not model the semantic and syntactic structure of the source code (via e.g., abstract syntax tree). While this alone would have not been a deal-breaker, the overall substance presented in the paper does not seem strong. Also, the empirical results are reasonable but not impressive given that the experiments are focused more on the synthetic data, and the experiments on the real source code are weaker and less clear as has been also noted by the fourth reviewer. \n\nVerdict:\nPossible weak reject.

It's nice that you've tested out different single synthetic edit patterns, but what happens in a dataset with multiple edit patterns? Because this will be the scenario in a real world dataset.\n\nThis is already in the paper. See the \u201cMultiTask\u201d dataset in Section 5 and results in Table 1.\n\n> 2. What happens when the order of edits is different in the prediction but the outcome is the same? Suppose we have edit A followed by B and the model predicts B followed by A, but the end result is the same? The accuracy metric will fail here? How can this be addressed?\n\nThe task as defined in the paper is to predict the order of edits, so A-then-B is considered different from B-then-A, which we think is sensible if the target task is suggesting next edits to a developer. We don't think a tool would be very useful if it was allowed to suggest any edit that a developer would make in the future. It could force the developer into a lot of unwanted context switching. However, please see the response to Reviewer 2 for an answer to a related question about alternative loss functions related to ordering issues.\n\n> 1. Firstly, where is the data obtained from? Who are the programmers? What was the setting under which the data was collected in ?\n\nThis is left vague for anonymity. The data set is from professional developers doing their day-to-day work. We will include de-anonymized details in the final version.\n\n> 3. What are the kinds of edits on the real world dataset? What happens if someone adds a 100 lines to a file and saves it? How is this edit added to the dataset?\n\nThanks for asking this. We should have noted that we require edit sequences to have at least three snapshots and no more than 256 subtoken changes. So the edit you describe will be pruned from the dataset.\n\n> 5. Some more dataset stats related to the real world data. For eg., how many tokens are in each snapshot?\n\nWe say in 6.2 that the initial states have up to 1000 subtokens in the snapshots.\n\n> 6. \"We evaluate models on their ability to predict a sequence of subtokens up to the next token boundary\" <-- Require more details about this. This section needs more clarity, its hard to interpret the results here.\n\nCould you clarify what additional details you'd like to see?\n\n> 7. Are you going to release this real world dataset?\n\nUnfortunately this isn't possible due to the sensitive nature of the data. However, we have been discussing possibilities for releasing a small sample or more creative solutions (e.g., predicting imputations of finer-grained changes from coarser-grained GitHub commits). If there is interest from the community and the paper is accepted, this is a discussion that we\u2019d be interested in having at the conference.\n\n> 8. If the real world dataset is large, why don't you report running time stats on that? Why use the synthetic dataset for testing scalability? If you have 8 million edits, that seems like a big enough dataset. How long did your models take on these?\n\nThe synthetic data allowed us to vary the relevant dimensions and evaluate running times in a more controlled way. There is nothing significantly different about the real data. We\u2019ll add precise numbers to an updated draft, but on the real data, the implicit attention model took roughly 6 hours to reach maximum validation accuracy, the implicit RNN model took roughly 10 hours, and the explicit model took roughly a week.\n\n> 4. Some Error analysis on the real world data? It's hard to understand how the model is doing by just reporting the accuracy as 61.1%. Lots of the accuracy points maybe obtained for obvious commonplace edits like keywords, punctuation etc.. ? \n> 2. The paper doesn't provide examples from this real world dataset nor are there examples of model predictions on this dataset.\n\nThis will take some work and isn\u2019t something that we can turn around immediately, but if the paper is accepted, we will commit to adding example model predictions and further error analysis to the final version.  \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Networks for Modeling Source Code Edits", "abstract": "Programming languages are emerging as a challenging and interesting domain for machine learning.

While we agree the encoder would need to be updated to use more structured representations of the code, the rest of the formulation would be applicable with minimal changes. This is a good direction for future work.\n\n> It could be that a candidate model predicts a different sequence with the same results in the snapshots. Then the training loss function should not penalize such solutions, but it will if the sequence is not strictly left-to-right. Did you need to tweak something here especially for larger changes?\n\nThere are of course situations where the imposed left-to-right order is not the true sequence of edits that was used to transform between snapshots by the developer. However, the snapshots are collected often during development (far more frequently than typical git commits), and so the number of edits between snapshots is usually small. Additionally we filter out edit sequences when the number of edits between two snapshots is large. As such, while the edit sequence we impose between pairs of snapshots may not be fully correct, we believe it is a good approximation and rarely too far from the real edit sequence. \n\nWe readily acknowledge that this strategy of assuming left-to-right order for edits between snapshots would likely not work as well for data with larger changes between snapshots like in git commit histories. In this case, one option would be to explore an EM-like training procedure, where the ordering is a latent variable that is inferred during training. However, in this work we focus on developing approaches for the fully supervised task and leave such extensions for future work.\n\n> A somewhat similar system with language models for predicting APIs based on sequences is [1], it would help to compare to it at least on a conceptual level. is [2] that predicts if a \"change\" is complete i.e if it misses to complete a change. However it does not predict the entire edit process, but only the last missing piece of a change (usually a bug if it is missed).\n\nThank you for pointing us to these references, they are certainly very relevant! There are a number of similarities, as well as important differences, between our problem formulation and approach compared to these. We actually do cite [2] in the paper, but we will elaborate on the differences with our work. With respect to [1], the problem is to predict a method call given a set of preceding changes and a location. That is, their approach assumes that the location is given, and are restricted to method calls from a given API. In [2], they are instead predicting the location of the next change, given the location of a previous change. Both of these utilize co-occurrence frequencies between changes in order to provide a ranking of suggested changes/locations respectively. In our approach, we try to predict both location and change at a finer level of granularity (subword tokens), using the entire sequence of changes up until the current timestep. This allows the model to potentially generalize previously seen edit patterns, to new locations in the code (as in the synthetic tasks), and helps to resolve ambiguities based on user intent (as in Figure 1). We will happily include these references in our discussion on related work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Networks for Modeling Source Code Edits", "abstract": "Programming languages are emerging as a challenging and interesting domain for machine learning.

Questions are answered inline below.\n\n> Is there a way the authors take can advantage of the structural requirements for source code? I don't see an obvious way, but I'm curious what the authors think.\n\nThis is an excellent insight, and we have definitely considered extensions of our models to structured data. As this was a question that was highlighted by multiple reviewers, please see our response in the general comment to all reviewers. The short answer is that we do believe such extensions are possible, but in this work we wanted to stay focused on formulating the problem itself before taking advantage of more domain-specific structures.\n\n> What's the benefit of using the implicit representation for the positions? The explicit/implicit position forms are basically just using the permutation or the inverse permutation form, which are equivalent. I don't see directly what's saved here, the alphabet size and the number of integers to store is the same.\n\nA key property of implicit positions is that they don\u2019t change as more edits are made. This enables the training efficiency like in Vaswani et al, where we can train on all output steps with a single forward-backward pass. We wouldn\u2019t be able to do this with explicit positions that potentially changed after each edit.\n\n> Similar question. The implicit likelihood is s^0, e^(1),...,e^(t-1), with the e^(i)'s being based on the implicit representations of the positions. Seems like you could do this with the *explicit* positions just fine, they carry enough information to derive s^(i) from s^(i-1). That is, the explicit/implicit problems are not really related to the explicit/implicit position representations.\n\nThis is fair. It\u2019s possible to derive the explicit positions given the previous edits in the implicit representation (like applying a diff), and indeed, in the experiments we are leveraging the fact that it is valid to compare results between models trained on the different representations. The point we\u2019re trying to make here is just one of how the data is presented to the neural network. In the implicit case, it\u2019s up to the neural network to \u201clearn how to apply the diff\u201d whereas in the explicit case, an external deterministic algorithm applies the diff for the neural network. So implicit vs explicit is more about distinguishing between what kinds of representations the network is given vs being forced to learn. We\u2019ll clarify the wording in \u201cProblem Statement\u201d to say that there is only one problem, which is to predict next edits given initial state and previous edits, but two families of architectures: explicit assumes an external algorithm applies the diffs to get explicit states that are fed into the network, and implicit works directly off the edits.\n\n> For the synthetic dataset, why are you selecting a random initial string, rather than using some existing generative text or source code model, which would get you synthetic data that more closely resembles code?\n\nIt would certainly be possible. The random initial strings were simpler because we have control over the vocabulary size and length of sequences, which allowed us to control how long the initial strings were and how many edits were applied. With real code, we think it would introduce a few more confounding factors.\n\n> I really liked the idea of using an oracle that gives the position as upper bound. Would it make sense to also have the opposite oracle that gives the edit symbol, but doesn't tell the location? I'm really curious which is the \"harder\" task, predicting the next symbol or the next location.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. It\u2019s not 100% clear to us what an oracle that \u201cpattern-matched\u201d on position given edit symbol would look like, but we agree it\u2019s interesting to think about. To answer the larger question of what the hardest part of the prediction is, we include some additional plots in Appendix B.3 of an updated version. The plots show that the most difficult part is predicting the jumps when one pattern is completed and then the model must decide where to edit next.\n\n> The explicit baseline model performs very well on all the edit types in Table 1. Are there cases where even this explicit case works poorly? Is the improved implicit model *always* upper bounded by the explicit model (to me it seems like the answer should always be yes, but it would be interesting to check it out for cases where explicit is not very high accuracy). \n\nThe implicit model gets slightly better results on the \u201cMultiTask\u201d problem in Table 1, so the explicit model is not *always* more accurate. However, we did find the explicit model to produce good accuracy across the board. The main issue with it is the memory and computational cost.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Networks for Modeling Source Code Edits", "abstract": "Programming languages are emerging as a challenging and interesting domain for machine learning.

All reviewers were generally positive about the paper, especially with regard to it presenting an interesting and novel problem formulation with significant potential impact.\n\nThe main common line of questioning among the reviewers was whether it would be fruitful and straightforward to consider extensions that incorporate code structure, such as an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation.\n\nThe extension is straightforward for the implicit attention model, although there are some design questions that would need to be studied. For data preparation, it is possible to compute diffs between tree-structured representations of snapshots using a tool like Gumtree (https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree), in which case the edits to trees could be broken down into insertions and deletions with locations represented as pointers to nodes in the tree. If you look at Figure 3, the decoder could work unmodified assuming that \u201cimplicit positions\u201d are replaced with something like \u201cnode id\u201d in a tree or graph. Thus, the main question would be how to design the encoder to jointly represent tree- or graph- structured initial state & previous edits. Natural starting points would be tree- or graph- neural networks, or if one wanted to stay within the Transformer framing of the problem, something like relative self-attention could be promising (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02155). Another structural idea that might be nice to explore in future work could be attention over subtrees rather than just nodes, as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03691.\n\nSo while we see more structured encoders as a natural extension and ultimately where we want to go with this line of work, our intention in this paper is to stay focused on formulating the problem of learning from and generating edits, and answering some of the more basic cross-cutting questions (e.g., should we use explicit vs implicit models?), leaving further architectural exploration for future work. This view also potentially allows the approach to be applied more generally to other domains involving edits to language, though fleshing out other real applications in other domains could be a large undertaking and is left for future work.\n\nIn summary, this paper motivates and defines a new way of thinking about models for generating source code. Reviewers agree with the novelty and importance of the problem (R1: \u201cThe application is obvious \u2026 would be very valuable.\u201d, R2: \u201cinteresting task with possible big impact\u201d, R3: \u201cvery interesting problem\u201d). The paper lays out several modeling approaches, compares their speed and accuracy on synthetic data and a real application, and discusses tradeoffs. Reviewers appreciate these components (R1: \u201cthe idea being to match the performance of the explicit (heavy) model with the implicit model. This is shown to be challenging, but a clever model is introduced that achieves this, and is thus the best of both worlds.\u201d; R2: \u201cgood trade-offs discussion\u201d\u2019  R3: \u201cdis/advantages are well elaborated\u201d). The other major questions are mostly about modeling extensions (more structured encoders; adding latent variables to represent ordering) or in other applications (text editing), which we take to be a sign that there are many interesting ways to build on this work.\n\nWe will provide answers to detailed reviewer-specific questions as direct replies to the individual reviews.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper529/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Neural Networks for Modeling Source Code Edits", "abstract": "Programming languages are emerging as a challenging and interesting domain for machine learning.

Once more semantic representation (let's say ASTs) are taken, the implicit attention techniques may need to also be updated.\n - It would help to elaborate more on the process defined in 5 for the real dataset that given a pair of code snapshots, assumes that one is obtained by simply inserting/removing the tokens in sequence. In particular, it could be that a candidate model predicts a different sequence with the same results in the snapshots.

The application is obvious: a system to accurately predict what the next edit should be would be very valuable for developers. Here, edits are modeled by two types of sequences: one that tracks the state of all edits at each time step (and is thus very long), and one that contains the initial step and a changelist that contains the minimal information required to derive the state at any time. The authors train models on top of both of these representations, with the idea being to match the performance of the explicit (heavy) model with the implicit model. This is shown to be challenging, but a clever model is introduced that achieves this, and is thus the best of both worlds. There are synthetic and real-world code (text) edit experiments.\n\nStrengths: The problem is well-posed and well-motivated. There's a nice application of powerful existing models, combined and tailored to the current work. The writing is generally quite clear. The number of experiments is quite solid. \n\nWeaknesses: The main flaw is that nothing here is really specifically for souce code; the authors are really just modeling edits in text sequences. There's not an obvious way to integrate the kinds of constraints that source code typically satisfies either. There's some confusion (for me) about the implicit/explicit representations. More questions below.\n\nVerdict: This is a pretty solid paper. It doesn't quite match up to its title, but it sets out a clearly defined problem, achieves its aims, and introduces some nice tricks. Although it doesn't produce anything genuinely groundbreaking, it seems like a nice step forward.\n\nComments and Questions:\n\n- The problem is written in the context of source code, but it's really setup just for text sequences, which is a broader problem. Is there a way the authors take can advantage of the structural requirements for source code? I don't see an obvious way, but I'm curious what the authors think.\n\n- What's the benefit of using the implicit representation for the positions? The explicit/implicit  position forms are basically just using the permutation or the inverse permutation form, which are equivalent. I don't see directly what's saved here, the alphabet size and the number of integers to store is the same.\n\n- Similar question. The implicit likelihood is s^0, e^(1),...,e^(t-1), with the e^(i)'s being based on the implicit representations of the positions. Seems like you could do this with the *explicit* positions just fine, they carry enough information to derive s^(i) from s^(i-1). That is, the explicit/implicit problems are not really related to the explicit/implicit position representations.\n\n- Just wanted to point out that this type of approach to sequences and edits has been studied pretty often in the information/coding theory communities, especially in the area of synchronization. There, the idea is to create the minimal \"changelist\" of insertions/deletions from two versions of a file. This could come in handy when building the datasets. See, for example, Sala et al \"Synchronizing files from a large number of insertions and deletions\".\n\n- The problem statement should be stated a bit more rigorously. We'd like to say that the initial state is drawn from some distribution and that the state at each time forms a stochastic process with some transition law. As it stands the problem isn't well-defined, since with no probability distribution, there's nothing to predict and no likelihood.\n\n- The \"analogical decoder\" idea is really nice.\n\n- For the synthetic dataset, why are you selecting a random initial string, rather than using some existing generative text or source code model, which would get you synthetic data that more closely resembles code?\n\n- I really liked the idea of using an oracle that gives the position as upper bound. Would it make sense to also have the opposite oracle that gives the edit symbol, but doesn't tell the location? I'm really curious which is the \"harder\" task, predicting the next symbol or the next location. In the information-theory setting, these two are actually equally hard, but the real-world setting might be pretty different. It would also be interesting to train models on top of the POMP. That would produce genuine upper bounds to the model performances. \n\n- The explicit baseline model performs very well on all the edit types in Table 1. Are there cases where even this explicit case works poorly? Is the improved implicit model *always* upper bounded by the explicit model (to me it seems like the answer should always be yes, but it would be interesting to check it out for cases where explicit is not very high accuracy).
