(2019) indeed also made use of IBP, but address a different NLP task, and an over-sensitivity specification. Their work is adapted to a model without attention component, and in contrast to their work we focus on word deletion perturbations.\n\nComment:\n\u201cSince upper and lower bounds are also propagated, do you backpropagate the gradients via these bounds or only via the original inputs?\u201d\n\nResponse:\nGradients are propagated backwards from the scalar training loss that is composed of both the standard log-likelihood objective, and the IBP contribution weighted by lambda. Note that the IBP contribution is a function of the bounds, which is a function of the model parameters, thus both loss contributions are a function of the model parameters. We can then compute gradients for how this loss changes depending on individual weights and biases, in the same vein as backpropagating errors from the standard differentiable training loss.\n\nComment:\n\u201cHow sensitive is the label in SNLI dataset to word removal? For some label types, such as entailment, it might have less of an effect that for the others.\u201d\n\nResponse:\nAll labels are affected, including the entailment label. In this context, Feng et al (2018) https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1407.pdf (Table 1) ran a study to measure human performance on reduced examples of the different classes, and the drop was sharpest for reduced samples of the entailment label (E).\n\nComment:\n\u201cHow is the accuracy distributed wrt different label types?\u201d\n\nResponse:\nWe found that verified accuracy is heavily skewed towards one label in SNLI: contradiction (58.2%), compared to neutral (1.3%) and entailment (0.0%, though nonzero). We furthermore observed a notable negative correlation (-0.19) of verified accuracy with lexical overlap of premise and hypothesis, even within the contradiction label, which has a lower rate of lexical overlap than the other two classes.\n\n\nComment:\n\u201cSince the accuracy of the proposed model drops the most, I am wondering how the verfied accuracy and accuracy are related during training? For example, can you show what is the verified accuracy with accuracy being close to the standard training?\u201d\n\nResponse:\nIn our experiments we observed that verified accuracy and standard accuracy correlate negatively with one another, and prior work has shown that there is a tradeoff between robustness and standard accuracy (Tsipras et al. (2019), https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12152). It actively hurts standard test accuracy when the model becomes verifiably less under-sensitive. This indicates that the signal that the model uses to form its prediction under standard training cannot be exploited (to the same extent) during verifiable training, and that the NLI task is then much harder to learn.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1670/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1670/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["johannes.welbl.14@ucl.ac.uk", "posenhuang@google.com", "stanforth@google.com", "sgowal@google.com", "dvij@google.com", "szummer@google.com", "pushmeet@google.com"], "title": "Towards Verified Robustness under Text Deletion Interventions", "authors": ["Johannes Welbl", "Po-Sen Huang", "Robert Stanforth", "Sven Gowal", "Krishnamurthy (Dj) Dvijotham", "Martin Szummer", "Pushmeet Kohli"], "pdf": "/pdf/60f5a5cd607e69be77c5ea713d4dd249c10e9b4a.pdf", "TL;DR": "Formal verification of a specification on a model's prediction undersensitivity using Interval Bound Propagation", "abstract": "Neural networks are widely used in Natural Language Processing, yet despite their empirical successes, their behaviour is brittle: they are both over-sensitive to small input changes, and under-sensitive to deletions of large fractions of input text.

It would be better to have a clear example for how this was computed.\u201d\n\nResponse:\nThank you for this suggestion, we have included a corresponding section into the appendix that expands on this.\n\nComment:\n\u201cIs the same approach also applicable to other model types, or only single layer attention-based models?\u201c\n\nResponse:\nInterval Bound Propagation as verification technique can be applied to other types of network architectures as well, such as CNN or feed-forward components (we refer to prior work on this in the Related Work section). We focused on the DAM architecture, where bound propagation has to be adapted to an attention-component, and believe that several aspects of this can be transferred to transformer-based architectures (e.g. attention renormalisation). There is however a caveat: deeper models tend to produce looser IBP bounds, and we would consequently expect lower verification rates for deep transformer models.\n\nComment:\n\u201cAlso, how this methods work for other NLI or NLU tasks?\u201d\n\nResponse:\nUnder-sensitivity has been established for NLI (with transferable attacks between models), and also for SQuAD (Feng et al. (2018)). IBP has been used with other neural layer types, and it should in a similar vein be possible to derive bounds for models used on other NLU tasks. It would be interesting to see how verification of under-sensitivity specifications would play out elsewhere, and we hope that future research will address this problem. \n\nComment:\n\u201cIn experiments, how the data augumentation penalize the model with a loss for specification violation? What does the equation look like?\u201d\n\nResponse:\nIn data augmentation training we compute, for a standard data point x, a randomly perturbed data point x\u2019 that has a random subset of words removed. We derive a hinge loss contribution from this as follows: lambda * max{0, P(y|x\u2019) - P(y|x)}, which is added to the standard training loss, where lambda is a scalar hyperparameter.\n\nComment:\n\u201cCan you explain a bit more for IBP-training? How that hinge loss applies to the objective function? Is the IBP training differentiable?\u201d\n\nResponse:\nThere is an upper bound (IBP) for the model output corresponding to the gold label y, and a nominal probability P(y|x). Both depend on all model parameters, and the difference delta between the two is again a function of all model parameters. This difference delta is fed into a hinge function lambda * max{0, delta} and we add it to the standard training loss, again with a scalar hyperparameter lambda. The resulting loss is then differentiable, and during model training the parameters are tuned to minimise the loss via gradient-based optimisation.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1670/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1670/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["johannes.welbl.14@ucl.ac.uk", "posenhuang@google.com", "stanforth@google.com", "sgowal@google.com", "dvij@google.com", "szummer@google.com", "pushmeet@google.com"], "title": "Towards Verified Robustness under Text Deletion Interventions", "authors": ["Johannes Welbl", "Po-Sen Huang", "Robert Stanforth", "Sven Gowal", "Krishnamurthy (Dj) Dvijotham", "Martin Szummer", "Pushmeet Kohli"], "pdf": "/pdf/60f5a5cd607e69be77c5ea713d4dd249c10e9b4a.pdf", "TL;DR": "Formal verification of a specification on a model's prediction undersensitivity using Interval Bound Propagation", "abstract": "Neural networks are widely used in Natural Language Processing, yet despite their empirical successes, their behaviour is brittle: they are both over-sensitive to small input changes, and under-sensitive to deletions of large fractions of input text.

The DAM architecture was chosen as it is one of the models for which under-sensitivity has originally been established (see Feng et al. (2018) https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1407.pdf, Section 5.2). You are right to observe that the DAM model we chose to verify is 5% behind the currently best model on SNLI, as measured in test accuracy (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/). \n\nComment:\n\u201cthe application of vanilla IBP is quite limited in certain model architectures. [...]non-trivial to adapt the proposed method to other more advanced models, such as the ones based on the Transformer model.\u201d\n\nResponse: \nNeural network verification is a very challenging problem to address, and an active research area in the community. In the image domain IBP can only scale to at most 10 layers on CIFAR10, and not to ImageNet or very deep networks (Gowal et al. (2018), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12715.pdf). Specification verification in NLP is itself a relatively new topic, and we expect that straightforward application of IBP to a deep transformer model would lead to interval bounds quickly growing with network depth, an obstacle that will have to be addressed to certify deeper networks. \n\nComment: \n\u201cHence, this work does not make enough contribution to be accepted\u201d\n\nResponse:\nWe agree that certification of other model architectures, such as the transformer, is a challenging and worthy goal. We see our work and model choice (smaller, and with transferable architectural components, such as attention) as a step in this direction.

The authors developed new verification approaches based on decomposable attention mechanism with interval bound propagation (IBP), which can prove the under-sensitivity issue given a model and a particular sample. The experimental results on SNLI and MNLI show that the proposed approach leads to a much improved verified accuracy.\n\n-- In general, \u201cunder-sensitivity\u201d is a very critical problem for applying neural models in natural language understanding where powerful neural networks tend to capture spurious correlations from the biased datasets. This submission formulates \u201cunder-sensitivity\u201d as a mathematical specification and then try to verify it with IBP verification. Although the used technique IBP is not new, it would interesting to have the verification in NLI models.\n\n-- Section 5 is a bit unclear how to compute the IBP for deleting several words, and what is the output. It would be better to have a clear example for how this was computed.\n\n-- As the author mentioned, the verification of under-sensitivity can also be done by using beam-search, although it is costly and not accurate. IBP is another more efficient option, but not the optimal neigher.

The upper bound at the final layer is then compared with the label probability of the original input to assess if the probability increases or not. By training model with a hinge loss based on this verification method, they show that the model becomes more robust to word removals.\n\nOverall, the paper is well written and the idea of using IBP with an attentive model seems to work empirically for SNLI datasets. But, the technical contribution feels incremental over previous approaches, especially Huang (2019). I have several questions related to some parts of the paper:\n\n- Since upper and lower bounds are also propagated, do you backpropagate the gradients via these bounds or only via the original inputs?\n- How sensitive is the label in SNLI dataset to word removal? For some label types, such as entailment, it might have less of an effect that for the others.\n- How is the accuracy distributed wrt different label types?\n- Since the accuracy of the proposed model drops the most, I am wondering how the verfied accuracy and accuracy are related during training? For example, can you show what is the verified accuracy with accuracy being close to the standard training?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1670/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1670/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["johannes.welbl.14@ucl.ac.uk", "posenhuang@google.com", "stanforth@google.com", "sgowal@google.com", "dvij@google.com", "szummer@google.com", "pushmeet@google.com"], "title": "Towards Verified Robustness under Text Deletion Interventions", "authors": ["Johannes Welbl", "Po-Sen Huang", "Robert Stanforth", "Sven Gowal", "Krishnamurthy (Dj) Dvijotham", "Martin Szummer", "Pushmeet Kohli"], "pdf": "/pdf/60f5a5cd607e69be77c5ea713d4dd249c10e9b4a.pdf", "TL;DR": "Formal verification of a specification on a model's prediction undersensitivity using Interval Bound Propagation", "abstract": "Neural networks are widely used in Natural Language Processing, yet despite their empirical successes, their behaviour is brittle: they are both over-sensitive to small input changes, and under-sensitive to deletions of large fractions of input text.
