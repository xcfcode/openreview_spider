I think the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion that highlights the differences between the proposed metric and other commonly used metrics.\nFurthermore, in the experiments, the paper only shows that MC dropout doesn't achieve realistic uncertainty estimates. I think concluding that variational approaches underestimate the variance is a bit of stretch (see section 4.1) , i e. it would be more convincing if other approaches (e.g Blundell et al. Hernandes-Lobato and Adams) are also considered.\nThe paper also just states that uncertainty estimates obtained by MC dropout are unrealistic but doesn't elaborates how to improve them.\n\nThe second contribution, a probabilistic architecture for semantic segmentation, is not introduced in the main paper. Instead details are only provided in the appendix. In my opinion the paper would be easier to follow if it would contain a section that motivates and described the proposed architecture before jumping directly to the experiments.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- the acronym FRRN is not defined\n\n- Section 4.2 last paragraph: I don't understand why samples obtain by MC dropout and from the latent space are considered to be from the same distribution? While both methods approximate the weight posterior they use different approximations for that.\n\n- In the introduction the paper states that the proposed segmentation network is a U-net like FRRN architecture , however in section 3 it says instead of a U-net based architecture a FRRN based architecture is used. This is somewhat confusing.\n\n- Section 4.1: how are the variances scaled for Figure 3 middle?\n\n- Section 4.1 It would be also interesting if other metrics, such as log-likelihood or RMSE, to see how well the model is able to fit the data.\n\n- I am also surprised that CVAE + MC underperforms to just using CVAE?\n\n- Section 4.1: how are the variances scaled for Figure 3 middle?\n\nReferences:\n\nEvaluating Bayesian Deep Learning Methods for Semantic Segmentation\nJishnu Mukhoti, Yarin Gal\narXiv:1811.12709 [cs.CV]\n\nWeight Uncertainty in Neural Networks\nCharles Blundell, Julien Cornebise, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Daan Wierstra\nICML 2015\n\n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Lobato J.

The paper introduces an uncertainty quality metric along with a statistical test based off this metric that enables a binary decision of whether to accept a model\u2019s uncertainties as realistic. The paper also introduces a new model for supervised image-to-image tasks that combines two existing uncertainty mechanisms, and achieves reasonable uncertainty estimates, in particular, demonstrating robustness to out-of-sample data.\n\nI am tending to reject, because although each of the two distinct contributions are good starts on interesting approaches, neither provides a convincing solutions for the main question, and the two contributions are quite distinct, so that the paper lacks a consistent thread.\n\nFirst, the Mahalanobis-based uncertainty evaluation makes sense, but it is not clear what it adds beyond the standard average negative log-likelihood (NLL) metric. Mahalanobis distance increases monotonically with negative log-likelihood, so is there any reason to expect it is a better way to compare models based on their uncertainty? Is there some experiment that could show that the new metric is better than NLL at evaluating uncertainty realism?\n\nThe statistical test could potentially be a nice real world tool for deciding whether to trust neural network uncertainties. However, the paper only applies the test in one case, where the MC dropout model is shown to have unrealistic uncertainties. To show that this test is useful, there should also be experiments where uncertainty estimates are shown to be realistic. Is there some alternative to MC dropout for regression or some improvements to the algorithm that could yield realistic uncertainties under this statistical test? E.g., would the U-Net-based model in the paper pass the test if it were adapted to regression problems?\n\nSecond, the new U-Net-based classification model looks like a reasonable approach, but it is disjoint from the new statistical test, and it is not clear that the method yields improvements to uncertainty realism, since there are no comparisons to external results. Since only a new architecture is used, it is not clear that the deficiencies in uncertainty realism are not architecture-specific. Is it that there are no existing architectures that can be applied to this problem? Also, is there some more realistic setting where the CVAE approach would improve in-sample scores, i.e., where out-of-sample data is not generated synthetically? Can the statistical test be adapted to the classification setting? Similar, to the case of regression, the uncertainty realism metrics used for classification are tightly coupled with the prediction accuracy; is there a way to decouple these, would one want to? The conclusion that CVAE is better than MC for this problem is solid, but is there a more general conclusion to be drawn? E.g., could a CVAE model yield realistic estimates in the regression setting?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper188/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper188/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"abstract": "Statistical models are inherently uncertain.

For regression, we propose to evaluate uncertainty realism---a strict quality criterion---with a Mahalanobis distance-based statistical test. An empirical evaluation reveals the need for uncertainty measures that are appropriate to upper-bound heavy-tailed empirical errors. Alongside, we transfer the variational U-Net classification architecture to standard supervised image-to-image tasks. It provides two uncertainty mechanisms and significantly improves uncertainty realism compared to a plain encoder-decoder model.", "title": "Towards More Realistic Neural Network Uncertainties", "keywords": ["uncertainty", "variational inference", "MC dropout", "variational autoencoder", "evaluation"], "authors": ["Joachim Sicking", "Alexander Kister", "Matthias Fahrland", "Stefan Eickeler", "Fabian Hueger", "Stefan Rueping", "Peter Schlicht", "Tim Wirtz"], "TL;DR": "We assess and improve the quality of neural network uncertainties by proposing an evaluation criterion and introducing a new uncertainty mechanism.", "authorids": ["joachim.sicking@iais.fraunhofer.de", "alexander.kister@iais.fraunhofer.de", "matthias.fahrland@iav.de", "stefan.eickeler@iais.fraunhofer.de", "fabian.hueger@volkswagen.de", "stefan.rueping@iais.fraunhofer.de", "peter.schlicht@volkswagen.de", "tim.wirtz@iais.fraunhofer.de"], "pdf": "/pdf/e306175babb8beb2eee62de1cbbe1aadb099c82c.pdf", "paperhash": "sicking|towards_more_realistic_neural_network_uncertainties", "original_pdf": "/attachment/e306175babb8beb2eee62de1cbbe1aadb099c82c.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nsicking2020towards,\ntitle={Towards More Realistic Neural Network Uncertainties},\nauthor={Joachim Sicking and Alexander Kister and Matthias Fahrland and Stefan Eickeler and Fabian Hueger and Stefan Rueping and Peter Schlicht and Tim Wirtz},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeB22VFvS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
