The paper does not justify why this particular application matters. I am not sure how such models could ever help to conference organizers. Besides, comparing the generated calls \"on average\" with the originals makes little sense: even n-gram models would succeed in such a comparison.\n\nOther issues include:\n- the evaluation method is not explained, the paper refers to Latent Semantic Indexing, but there is no explanation in the text what precisely was done\n- almost the whole paper is written in the present perfect sense, which does not seem grammatically correct\n- \\citet should be replace with \\citep almost everywhere\n\nTo sum up, the paper is not well-motivated, there are issues in both execution and writing.
