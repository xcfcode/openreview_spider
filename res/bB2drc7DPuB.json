This results on one hand from the nonconvexity of the map $\\pi \\mapsto \\mathbb E_\\rho[V_\\pi]$ - resulting from the complex dependency of $V_\\pi$ on $\\pi$ - and on the other from the softmax map $f \\to \\pi_f$, which is also nonconvex. While the latter results from a choice of the authors, the former is, a priori, intrinsic to the problem at hand: the value function is known to enjoy only one-point convexity properties even in the tabular setting for general problems. Consequently, combining this nonconvex landscape with a low expressivity of the model may result in local minima of the dynamics. We avoid this problem by requiring sufficient expressive power of the used model, which in turn allows us to take advantage of the properties of the landscape at hand. In the supervised setting, the expressivity assumption was not needed as the loss functional was assumed to be convex, thereby removing the possibility of observing spurious minima.\n\nConcerning the convergence of the particle system to the mean-fiend PDE, the main difficulty compared with the supervised setting results is to establish needed Lipschitz continuity properties of the vector field driving the transport PDE. Again, while these properties are assumed or immediate in the supervised case, proving them requires more effort in the RL setting given the more involved dependence of the vector field on the measure $\\nu_t$. Once this result is established, a standard Gronwall argument concludes the proof of convergence.\n\nWe stress the above point in the updated version of the paper (edits in red). Hoping that our response and revision have satisfactorily addressed the referee\u2019s remarks, we thank them again for their insightful comments.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global optimality of softmax policy gradient with single hidden layer neural networks in the mean-field regime", "authorids": ["~Andrea_Agazzi2", "~Jianfeng_Lu1"], "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "keywords": ["policy gradient", "entropy regularization", "mean-field dynamics", "neural networks"], "abstract": "We study the problem of policy optimization for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes with softmax policy and nonlinear function approximation trained with policy gradient algorithms.

We agree with them that there still exists a gap that needs to be filled between theory and practice, and in particular between the behavior of the finite-step and finite-neuron model and the asymptotic limit studied in this paper. While we anticipate that the error resulting from finite step-size can be controlled, over finite time intervals, by standard stochastic approximation results, the finite-width analysis may pose more complex challenges. Indeed, in the finite-width regime the full-support assumption at initialization will fail, and to establish similar optimality results as those presented in this paper, precise estimates on the empirical measure of parameters throughout the dynamics will be needed. Therefore, while we look at this question with great interest, it is beyond the scope of our current work. \n\nSimilarly, the question of quantitative convergence estimates for the nonlinear dynamics at hand is, in the general case, widely open. The main difficulty in this setting results from the non-geodesic convexity of the energy of the PDE problem (with respect to the Wasserstein metric). As indicated in the response to AnonReviewer2, this issue has been bypassed in a few special cases in the recent literature, either by considering a subclass of the models [Javanmard, Mondelli, Montanari, 2019], or by regularizing the objective function [Chizat, 2019]. \n\nWe thank again the referee for their remarks and hope that our response could address their concerns in a satisfactory way.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global optimality of softmax policy gradient with single hidden layer neural networks in the mean-field regime", "authorids": ["~Andrea_Agazzi2", "~Jianfeng_Lu1"], "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "keywords": ["policy gradient", "entropy regularization", "mean-field dynamics", "neural networks"], "abstract": "We study the problem of policy optimization for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes with softmax policy and nonlinear function approximation trained with policy gradient algorithms.

More specifically, in [Javanmard, Mondelli, Montanari, 2019] the family of approximators being considered fixes the weights of the last layer, obtaining convergence results by the resulting convexity of the landscape in Wasserstein space, while [Chizat, 2019], [Mei, Montanari, Nuyen, 2018] obtain convergence properties of the model by regularizing the loss function (explicitly or implicitly). These works give examples of how, under further regularity assumptions, it is indeed possible to establish compactness and convergence of the model. We expect similar results to hold in the RL setting, at the possible expense of a certain degree of suboptimality of the limiting policy, depending on the compatibility between the regularization and the \u201cplanted\u201d policy (for instance, if the optimal policy is given by a finite-width neural network, then one would expect adding sparsifying regularization to enable policy gradient to find such a policy).\nAs for the general case, if the convergence fails to happen it is not clear, in general, what kind of non-convergent behaviour will be displayed by the dynamics. One important point of distinction in this sense is whether the optimal approximator lies in the space of functions that can be approximated by the neural network with the given nonlinearity: if this is not the case divergent behavior has been observed in [Chizat, Bach, 2020] while, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no limit cycle dynamics in parameter space has so far appeared in the literature. If, on the other hand, the target approximator does lie in the approximation space of the model at hand, to the best of our knowledge no counter-examples to the conjectured convergent behavior are known.\n\nFor the limiting policy, we agree with the referee that the optimal policy is indeed the Boltzmann policy induced by the optimal  Q function for the entropy-regularized problem, and not the one induced by the optimal Q function of the underlying, unregularized problem. We further clarify this point in the updated version of the manuscript (edits in red).\n\nWe hope that our response and revision have satisfactorily addressed the referee\u2019s questions.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global optimality of softmax policy gradient with single hidden layer neural networks in the mean-field regime", "authorids": ["~Andrea_Agazzi2", "~Jianfeng_Lu1"], "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "keywords": ["policy gradient", "entropy regularization", "mean-field dynamics", "neural networks"], "abstract": "We study the problem of policy optimization for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes with softmax policy and nonlinear function approximation trained with policy gradient algorithms.

It well explains why a neural network policy is globally optimal given (1)it is stationary under the training via the first-order method (2)its parameterization has strong expressive power, e.g. it has infinite parameters or it is essentially a nonparametric model. \n\nThe convergence (section 4.2) to the many-particle limit. i.e. mean-field limit, seems standard, as the authors claim it is very similar to the case of supervised learning.

The experiments shown in Figure 1 are conducted with finite number of neutrons and constant step-size, but the theorems are stated under the adiabatic limit.

By modelling the hidden layer as a probability distribution over the parameter space, the training dynamics of policy gradient methods can be written as a partial differential equation. Under certain regularity conditions, the paper shows that if the training dynamics converge to a stationary point, this limiting point is a globally optimal policy. The paper also presents results for finite-time convergence of the training dynamics for neural networks to the mean-field limit.\n\nThe optimization landscape and convergence properties of policy gradient methods have drawn attention in RL theory for a long time, and it is nice to see a work that studies this problem from the perspectives of mean-field limit of neural networks, albeit being completely asymptotic. Overall I think this makes an interesting contribution, and I appreciate the sketch of proof ideas in the simpler bandit case. Technically, it seems that the main results are built upon existing frameworks of Mei et al., (2018), Chizat and Bach et al., (2018), etc. But the author also pointed out an interesting technical novelty, which is the use of density arguments when the problem structure is in lack of the hidden convexity used in other works.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears to me that one major weakness of the result is that the theorem holds true only when the dynamics converges to a stationary point. Can the authors provide conditions under which this can happen? For example, would it be possible to establish some compactness under additional regularity conditions and use it to show the convergence of a subsequence? If the convergence does fail to happen in certain regimes, how will the dynamics behave? Will it convergence to a limiting cycle or diverge? Are there some natural counter-examples? It would be helpful if the authors could provide more discussions on this condition.\n\nAdditionally, it seems to me that the paper actually shows that (due to entropic regularization) the limiting point is the Boltzman policy induced by the optimal Q function (at temparature $\\tau$), instead of the optimal Q function iteslf. If that is the case, this needs to be stated clearly in the theorem.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2174/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Global optimality of softmax policy gradient with single hidden layer neural networks in the mean-field regime", "authorids": ["~Andrea_Agazzi2", "~Jianfeng_Lu1"], "authors": ["Andrea Agazzi", "Jianfeng Lu"], "keywords": ["policy gradient", "entropy regularization", "mean-field dynamics", "neural networks"], "abstract": "We study the problem of policy optimization for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes with softmax policy and nonlinear function approximation trained with policy gradient algorithms.
