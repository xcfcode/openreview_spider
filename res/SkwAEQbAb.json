Some of the more obvious issues, each alone sufficient for rejection, include:\n\n1. Discrepancy between motivation and actual work. The method is specifically about determining the rank of a matrix, but the authors motivate it with way too general and vague relationships, such as \"determining the number of nodes in neural networks\". Somewhat oddly, the problem is highlighted to be of interest in supervised problems even though one would expect it to be much more important in unsupervised ones.\n\n2. Complete lack of details for related work. Methods such as PA and MAP are described with vague one-sentences summaries that tell nothing about how they actually work. There would have been ample space to provide the mathematical formulations.\n\n3. No technical contribution. The proposed method is trivial variant of randomised testing, described with single sentence \"Bootstrapped samples R_B are simply generated through random sampling with replacement of the values of R.\" with literally no attempt of providing any sort of justification why this kind of random sampling would be good for the proposed task or what kind of assumptions it builds on.\n\n4. Poor experiments using really tiny artificial data sets, reported in unprofessional manner (visual style in plots changes from figure to figure, tables report irrelevant numbers in hard-to-read format etc).
