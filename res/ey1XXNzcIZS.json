The motivation is to train a single mixture model that can serve the training and prediction of multiple models. Several strategies are proposed: token-level, sentence-level and task-level. This is a simple and straightforward approach (which is fine). The main concerns from the reviewers regard novelty and missing comparisons. In their updated draft, the authors added comparisons to bilingual models and they added a discussion wrt related work. However, the author\u2019s response did not address enough some of other reviewers\u2019 concerns regarding comparison with other approaches, and the lack of novelty persists (mixture models for multi-task learning have been previously proposed in the literature), which makes me lean towards rejection. I suggest the authors address these aspects in future iterations of their work.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Routing Strategies for Multilingual Mixture-of-Experts Models", "authorids": ["~Sneha_Kudugunta1", "~Yanping_Huang1", "~Ankur_Bapna1", "krikun@google.com", "lepikhin@google.com", "~Thang_Luong1", "~Orhan_Firat1"], "authors": ["Sneha Kudugunta", "Yanping Huang", "Ankur Bapna", "Maxim Krikun", "Dmitry Lepikhin", "Thang Luong", "Orhan Firat"], "keywords": ["Mixture-of-Experts", "Neural Machine Translation", "Multilingual", "Multi-Task Learning", "Conditional Computation", "Natural Language Processing"], "abstract": "Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been a successful approach for scaling multilingual translation models to billions of parameters without a proportional increase in training computation.

We first address general concerns among reviewers.\n\n1. Novelty\nDespite sharing similarities with existing works, we believe ours is the first work that performs comprehensive studies of routing strategies for sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts models. Existing applications of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts models in NLP, such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538, have generally made routing decisions only at the token level.\n\nAnother important aspect of our work is to demonstrate that task-level sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts can lead to significant improvements in terms of inference efficiency while being competitive in translation quality. To highlight the inference efficiency benefits of our approach, we have added additional measurements to the updated draft. We assume under the ideal case where the serving batch size can be as large as possible, we demonstrated that the task-level MoE approach can still achieve upto 2.6x higher throughput and negligible communication overhead (vs 36% of time being spent in communication). Moreover the task-level decoder has 32.3x less parameters at inference time, which in turn required much less accelerators to load the model. This is especially useful for the more practical cases when the server can only accumulate smaller batch size.\n\n\n2. Experimental results\nIn response to feedback we have added some additional baselines to our draft in Table 1: (1) Bilingual baselines (2) A larger 473M Transformer Big baseline. We also tried to train an MoE baseline with fixed experts, but faced model instability issues - suggesting that there may be benefits to learned experts. \n\nOur method outperforms bilingual baselines by 2.5 BLEU. On the other hand, our method is competitive with the dense Transformer Big baseline (Transformer Big baseline is +0.2 BLEU on average).  Note that TransformerBig incurs much higher decoding cost. We measured our task-level MoE achieved 8.4x higher decoding throughput. Moreover, we reiterate that the motivation behind scaling sparsely is to increase capacity with little overhead while remaining competitive with dense models - for example, while it is feasible to train a 473M parameter model, training a dense 13B model (the size of our scaled up model in Figure 2) is prohibitively slow and expensive. \n\nWe have updated our draft to reflect these changes.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1065/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1065/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Routing Strategies for Multilingual Mixture-of-Experts Models", "authorids": ["~Sneha_Kudugunta1", "~Yanping_Huang1", "~Ankur_Bapna1", "krikun@google.com", "lepikhin@google.com", "~Thang_Luong1", "~Orhan_Firat1"], "authors": ["Sneha Kudugunta", "Yanping Huang", "Ankur Bapna", "Maxim Krikun", "Dmitry Lepikhin", "Thang Luong", "Orhan Firat"], "keywords": ["Mixture-of-Experts", "Neural Machine Translation", "Multilingual", "Multi-Task Learning", "Conditional Computation", "Natural Language Processing"], "abstract": "Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been a successful approach for scaling multilingual translation models to billions of parameters without a proportional increase in training computation.

This exploration is motivated by the need for efficient inference in MoE models, for which token-based routing is a limitation. The alternative is task-based routing, where examples for a task are assigned to the same experts. This allows efficient device placement and request dispatch at inference time. The paper compares with the approaches as well as hybrid approaches where different parts of the network use different routing mechanisms. The results show that task level routing is comparable to token-level routing with the added benefit of inference efficiency. Performing task-based routing on the decoder side only gives better better translation quality, at the cost of inference efficiently. An analysis of routing decision in token-based routing justifies the design choices. \n\nOverall, the paper takes a focused problem and experimentally shows an solution that improves inference efficiency. The experiments are well-described and the paper is well-written. \nWhile, the result is interesting it is only a marginal contribution with little novelty in my opinion. It would also be interesting to see how this approaches compares with simpler approaches that deterministically allot parameters to different languages (Wang etal 2018, Bapna etal 2019, Zhang etal 2020)  or language groups (Fan etal 2020). \n \n- Yining Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Feifei Zhai, Jingfang Xu, and Chengqing Zong.

The paper claims that with task-level routing, the server only needs to pre-load K experts (assuming top-K routing for MoE layers) during inference, instead of loading all experts as in token/sentence level routing.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the analyses and comprehensive experiment studies in this paper, and also the large-scale in-house datasets used in experiments. The experiment findings about the different routing strategies in the encoder and decoder in en-xx and xx-en settings are also interesting. The connections between the gating distribution and the similar of languages in Figure 3 also make sense.\n\nHowever, I doubt the novelty and machine learning contribution of this paper: 1) The different routing strategies are natural and seems to have already been proposed by previous works. e.g., for task-level routing, [1] used similar kind of mixture of experts in the language level. 2) This paper simply studies different routing strategies, which is more like empirical analyses. Although the results are somewhat interesting, they are not surprising and most findings are in expectation. \n\n[1] Universal Neural Machine Translation for Extremely Low Resource Languages. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05368.pdf\n\nMeanwhile, I have some questions on the experiment settings: when comparing with the single multilingual base model in Table 1 and Figure 2, the parameters of the MoE model are larger than the single multilingual model (e.g., 533M vs 142M in Table 1). Therefore, it is obvious that MoE model achieves better accuracy than smaller single multilingual model. The MoE models should compare with a single multilingual model with the same amount of parameters. \n\nAnother important thing I need to point out is that this paper seems to violate the anonymous policy of ICLR 2021.

Meta reviewer can further double confirm if this violates the policy.\n \nBesides, this paper is not carefully written and there are many typos which affect the reading. e.g., 1) Two \"wo_e\" in the line below the equation in Section 2; 2) \"to route the token to a select few experts\", there is an additional \"a\"; 3) \"a learning rate of a learning rate of 3.0\" in Section 4.1.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1065/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1065/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Exploring Routing Strategies for Multilingual Mixture-of-Experts Models", "authorids": ["~Sneha_Kudugunta1", "~Yanping_Huang1", "~Ankur_Bapna1", "krikun@google.com", "lepikhin@google.com", "~Thang_Luong1", "~Orhan_Firat1"], "authors": ["Sneha Kudugunta", "Yanping Huang", "Ankur Bapna", "Maxim Krikun", "Dmitry Lepikhin", "Thang Luong", "Orhan Firat"], "keywords": ["Mixture-of-Experts", "Neural Machine Translation", "Multilingual", "Multi-Task Learning", "Conditional Computation", "Natural Language Processing"], "abstract": "Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been a successful approach for scaling multilingual translation models to billions of parameters without a proportional increase in training computation.

While this approach is simple and straightforward, I have some concerns. \n\nPros:\n- A mixture model is proposed for multilingual NMT, forming a hierarchical structure:  token-level, sentence-level, and task-level.\n- The general framework is reasonable, straightforward, and easy to implement.\n- Experiments are extensive (both the WMT data and massive NMT data).\n\n\nCons:\n- The general idea is not novel. Building a mixture model for multi-task learning has been well studied in the literature [1,2] (not cited). The relation may need to be clarified.\n- In the experiment part, the results of single models (not unified multilingual model) need to be reported.\n- Comparisons with other unified multilingual approaches are required [3,4],\n\n\n\n[1] Ma et al.

These models, however, are prohibitively large for serving deployment and there is no easy way to extract a sub-network to decode for a particular language pair. This work proposes improved strategies to route MoE models by tasks instead of tokens, thus enabling separation of network structures at decoding time while enjoying the benefits of scale and task sharing at training time.\nWe compare routing strategies at multiple levels (token, sentence, task) in both, the encoder and the decoder, and conduct extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the public WMT dataset of 30 language pairs and an in-house web-scale dataset of 200 language pairs. On WMT, with a Transformer base model with 32 experts, our task-level MoE outperforms the best performing token-level MoE model by +1.0 BLEU on average over all language pairs. When scaling up to Transformer big model with 128 experts on the large-scale massively multilingual benchmark, our task-level MoE is competitive with token-level MoE while being able to reduce the decoder model size by a factor of $32.34$ and increase peak throughput by 2.6 times at inference.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "kudugunta|exploring_routing_strategies_for_multilingual_mixtureofexperts_models", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/8819d4f5a80fa880ffe9828f7c3df222488c11ed.zip", "pdf": "/pdf/ea9347c7cb24cc0c4d080e08eb745f4e8c51bdee.pdf", "reviewed_version_(pdf)": "https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=kB6Eznd0s", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkudugunta2021exploring,\ntitle={Exploring Routing Strategies for Multilingual Mixture-of-Experts Models},\nauthor={Sneha Kudugunta and Yanping Huang and Ankur Bapna and Maxim Krikun and Dmitry Lepikhin and Thang Luong and Orhan Firat},\nyear={2021},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ey1XXNzcIZS}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).
