Our extended version could be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02741.pdf\n\n\n- We did use Yin et al (2016b) as our baseline. And Tables 2a and 2e are test performance. \n\n96.5% in Table 2e is not included in Table 2a because 96.5% is achieved by our proposed coupling approach (after one-round co-training), whereas Table 2a's Distributed and Symbolic columns refer to either single of the world. \n\nBesides, the 96.4% performance is obtained with step-by-step supervision; therefore it's also not included in Table 2a (where only denotations are used for supervision). We have clarified these in the revised paper.\n\nThanks again for the review.

The idea is simple: the distributed enquirer is used for the policy initialization for the symbolic executer which is trained using REINFORCE. The proposed method outperforms the baseline SEMPRE on a QA dataset. \n\n* Discussion: \n- The paper is quite difficult to read, not because of the idea is complicated. Several details (e.g. math symbols) about the distributed enquirer can be safely omitted. Figure 1 hardly helps. It seems like the authors tried to shorten a long paper by \"copy and paste\". \n- The experimental results are impressive. However, why didn't the authors choose Yin et al (2016b) as the baseline? Table 2e is unclear: are the results on the dev or test set? If they are on the dev set, I was surprised to see that the performance on the test set is even substantially higher than the dev set. If they are on the test set, I then have no idea why the accuracy 96.5 is not on table 2a. \n\nTL,DR; I think the idea and the experimental results are good enough, but the paper must be rewritten in a clearer way.
