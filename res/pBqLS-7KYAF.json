The eigenspectrum study of $f(X)^T f(X)$, and specifically of $f(W X)^T f(W X)$ for some random projection matrix $W$ has been performed on the case where $X$ has i.i.d. (noise-like) entries [PW17]; we believe that our analysis can be extended to those models, on more structural and realistic data. \n\n**Two-cluster model**\nWe present our results on a (symmetric) two-cluster model here mainly for simplicity of exposition and interpretable ease. Our results straightforwardly generalize to a multi-cluster setting under a more general mixture model as in (Liao & Couillet, 2019). This, however, may unavoidably lead to even more complex results than, e.g., the current Corollary 1 and Proposition 1. In the current version of the article, we provided experiments on MNIST data in Figure 7, and on more MINIST-like data as well as on CNN features of ImageNet data in Appendix B (those having been moved there due to space limitation). These empirical results, together with our theoretical results on a natural, yet already non-trivial, model, convey our main message that spectral clustering and more generally kernel-based methods are stable under non-linear transformation such as sparsification and quantization. We will clarify the possible extensions, and place more emphasis on the experimental results in the revised version of this article. \n\n**Assumption 1**\nAssumption 1 is merely a technical assumption here, posed to ensure that our technical result in Theorem 1 holds for a larger family of non-linear function $f$ that may be of broader interest (beyond those in Eq.3-5). Note that, in the current version, we state the $f_1, f_2, f_3$ under consideration *all* satisfy Assumption 1 (just below Figure 1). In effect, the vast majority of commonly used non-linear functions satisfy Assumption 1 (counter-example exists though, e.g., $\\exp(P(t))$ fails for any polynomial $P(t)$ of degree greater than $2$), and it is stated here mainly for technical completeness.\nStill, we agree with the reviewer that the assumption, as it stands, looks heavily technical and hides the, after all, 'mild' nature of the request on $f$; in our revised version, we will clarify this discussion and introduce the aforementioned counter-example for concreteness.\n\n**Theorem 1**\nThe importance of Theorem 1 is briefly discussed after (6): as a reminder, it can be shown (in Corollary 2) and confirmed in Figure 2 that only isolated eigenvectors contain the cluster information. These isolated eigenpairs appear to be a key object in spectral clustering analysis [Baik et al., 2005, VL07, JY16], and refer to the two rightmost eigenvalues visually *away* from the main eigenvalue bulk in Figure 2. We will add more explanations and citations to clarify this in a revised version. \nAs a consequence, to qualitatively evaluate the performance of spectral clustering, one needs to discover the limiting spectrum of the main bulk (red dashed line in Figure 2) as well as the behavior of isolated eigenvectors (Corollary 2): these all follow from the key Theorem 1, as shortly discussed below (6). The major implication of Theorem 1 is that the aforementioned spectral behavior of $K$ depends on the non-linear $f$ only via the *three* parameters $a_1, a_2, \\nu$ defined in (8). In particular, for $f_1, f_2, f_3$, we have $a_2 = 0$ and it remains to discuss the ratio $a_1^2/\\nu$ as has been done in Section 4. \nWe see that these unconventional notions are prone to mislead the readers and will add more detailed explanations of our technical results such as Theorem 1 in the revised version of the article.\n\n**Proposition 1**\nAs mentioned above for Theorem 1, the eigenspectrum of $K$ depends on $f_1, f_2, f_3$ via the corresponding $a_1^2/\\nu$, which, via $F(x)$ defined in (10), determines the eigen-alignment $\\alpha$ in (11) and therefore the spectral clustering performance via Proposition 1. This connection is discussed after Remark 1 and illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Again, we see that these notions, classical in random matrix analysis, are possibly less familiar to machine learning experts not used to these technical terms: we will better explain the necessary connections in the revised version of the article.\n\n[PW17] Pennington, J. and Worah, P., 2017.

Eigen decomposition of large matrices is computationally very expensive and therefore methods like sparsification is used in order to reduce the computational complexity, while adding some amount of error. Therefore, theoretical bounds which quantize the amount of deviation because of such processing steps is essential to understand how much/little degraded the performance of machine learning applications are because of this step. This work considers the important case of spectral clustering with a 2 class mixture of subexponential models using \nthe Grammian matrix X^{T}X under entry wise non-linear transformations (specifically thresholding, binarization and quantization).\n\nThe theoretical analysis derives asymptotic eigenvalue distribution f(X^{T}X/sqrt{p})/sqrt{p} for some entry wise non linear function f. The analysis heavily relies on entry wise central limit theorems for each entry and expansion of \nf using Gaussian orthogonal polynomials. It is shown that the limiting distribution depends only on the low order coefficients in the Gaussian polynomial expansion. Asymptotic accuracy rates for spectral clustering follows via Cauchy integral formula applied to the resolvent matrix, which is a standard technique in random matrix theory.\n \nProposition 1 is the most relevant contribution of the paper to machine learning - a parameter gamma is recognized based on the polynomial expansion of f which is a threshold for signal to noise ratio rho. if rho < gamma, asymptotically, \nspectral clustering doesn't work and when rho > gamma, precise asymptotic accuracy is derived for spectral clustering, depending only on rho and f. The analysis is largely independent on the specific mixture distribution considered because of the \nuse of central limit theorems. \n\n\nThe results are very nice and gives a firm theoretical understanding of a well studied practical problem in machine learning. The results are precise and look complete. I would like to see further research with non-asymptotic rates for misclassification. \nIt could be possible to apply quantitative Berry-Esseen type local limit theorems to derive such results.

The most important application I can immediately see is sparsifying the kernel matrix so it can be computationally used efficiently. Or similarly, apply quantization and binarization, as the authors mention.\n\nFirst, a high level point: I wonder what the implication is of a non-linear transformation applied on X*X' instead of the design matrix itself X -- which is what seems more useful to me. You would want to apply the non-linear transformation on the actual vectors, not on the dot products between all of their pairs, isn't it? Though, I do see the value in \"zeroing out\", for example, or sparsifying the kernel matrix X*X', as working with kernel matrices can be problematic because of their size and density. I suppose, also, maybe a transformation on X can be translated into a transformation on X*X'? Not always.\n\nI also wonder if the model presented here is not too simple to make the claim that spectral clustering is stable under perturbation to the kernel matrix. My understanding is that the author's model is rather toyish, consisting of only two clusters -- is that correct? How do your results generalize to more than two clusters? Is it a trivial step to make, or does it require significantly more thought?\n\nRegarding Assumption 1, it is quite difficult to unpack it. Can you at least confidently state that Eq.3-5 satisfy this assumption? Can you give a few examples of other f's that satisfy that, or at least give an intuition what this assumption means? What properties of f is it related to? How is p coming into play?\n\nTheorem 1 again needs some unpacking and intuition. Why is it important? The text that comes after the theorem makes it even more confusing -- what is the implication on the K matrix for that? For example, how would it be reduced for f which is just a sparsification, I would be curious? Is there a way to instantiate all the quantities in Theorem 1 as a corollary to get a better picture of how sparsification affects K and how it differs from previous results in the literature? Figure 1 helps do that, but it is far from being complete.\n\nProposition 1 is a bit easier to unpack (though \"with the convention... etc\" maybe add a footnote that there is some degree of freedom there, otherwise it is unclear). I am slightly concerned that under all these complex expressions there might be results that are not very strong, but it is hard to track, because tracing each quantity back to a concrete value would take a lot of time. Again, I strongly urge the authors to instantiate some of their results to simple cases, where many of the variables and traces of variables disappear, so that the strength of the results can be thought about.\n\nI would expect for example a corollary in a simple form that roughly states: \"Say x is drawn from the clustering model as above in Eq. 1. Say we use f as in Eq. 3 (and hence Assumption 1 is instantiated with the orthogonal polynomial framework). Then: (a) the eigenvector/eigenvalue of K stays such and such within the one of X; (b) spectral clustering will have this much or such increase in the error rate.\"\n\nIf you could do it for f's in Eq. 4-5 that's even better.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. \"One approach to overcoming this limitation is simple subsampling: dividing X into subsamples of size \u03b5n, for some \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1), on which one performs parallel computation, and then recombining.\"\n\nWhat type of computation?\n\n2. In Eq. 1 -- are you saying you have a mixture model with two components C1 and C2? Might be a good idea to state that explicitly. Is there a specific prior probability to belong to C_1 or C_2?\n\n3. Explain what are \"isolated eigenvalues\" or cite.\n\n\nFull disclosure: given the time constraints and me being an emergency reviewer, I didn't look carefully at the supplementary materials.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper525/AnonReviewer7"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper525/AnonReviewer7"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Sparse Quantized Spectral Clustering", "authorids": ["~Zhenyu_Liao1", "~Romain_Couillet1", "~Michael_W._Mahoney1"], "authors": ["Zhenyu Liao", "Romain Couillet", "Michael W.

In particular, we show that very little change occurs in the informative eigenstructure, even under drastic sparsification/quantization, and consequently that very little downstream performance loss occurs when working with very aggressively sparsified or quantized spectral clustering problems.\nWe illustrate how these results depend on the nonlinearity, we characterize a phase transition beyond which spectral clustering becomes possible, and we show when such nonlinear transformations can introduce spurious non-informative eigenvectors.", "code_of_ethics": "I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics", "paperhash": "liao|sparse_quantized_spectral_clustering", "supplementary_material": "", "pdf": "/pdf/26efa7df2ba6ab8a833b21a2c4c741e420ba7584.pdf", "venue": "ICLR 2021 Spotlight", "venueid": "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nliao2021sparse,\ntitle={Sparse Quantized Spectral Clustering},\nauthor={Zhenyu Liao and Romain Couillet and Michael W.
