First, we would like to draw your attention to our  general comment, answering questions about overall baselines for anomaly localization and statistics on the benefits of our method. This comment also explains changes in the last revision of the paper.\n\nWe will address your concerns in order\u00a0:\n\n1) We understand your concern about the differences in AUROC values compared to Bergmann et al. CVPR'19.\nPlease note that as the code for Bergmann et al. CVPR'19 has not been released, we have implemented ourselves the L2 and DSSIM autoencoder baselines used in the paper. However, our experimental settings have some differences which may explain why the empirical AUC values are not exactly the same of Bergmann et al. CVPR'19. These differences are motivated by a desire to have a single setup of architecture and hyperparameters for all datasets. In details\u00a0:\n\n- As we explained in the Section 4.1 of our paper, we always work with images of size 128\u00d7128 for textures and objects, while Bergmann et al. work with images of size 256\u00d7256 for objects datasets and 128\u00d7128 for textures datasets.\n- The exact parameters for the random translation and rotation data augmentations for objects datasets are not provided in the paper of Bergmann et al. CVPR'19, thus it is very likely that we do not perform exactly the same data augmentation and thus the training data for the models may be different.\n- We always compute the ROC directly patch-by-patch from the autoencoder anomaly maps, while Bergmann et al. CVPR'19 reconstruct the texture images from the fusion of overlapping patches and perform averaging of the resulting anomaly maps.\n\nWe computed plots to compare Bergmann et al. results with our baselines. \nL2-AE\u00a0:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RENg0yG.png\nSSIM-AE:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pocIdPw.png\nThese show that while there are indeed differences in the two implementations, the trend remains comparable. Furthermore, as detailed in our general comment, we feel that the main contribution of our paper is a method to improve the results of any AE-based model rather than providing a new baseline model for anomaly detection.\n\n2) Considering the MVTec anomaly dataset, we could argue that there is not a single baseline model which has the best performance for every object and texture category. This is what we observed in our experiments, and it goes in line with the experiments in the benchmark performed by Bergmann et al. 2019. Nevertheless, the autoencoder trained with L2 or DSSIM has the best performance in average in Bergmann et al. 2019, so we included these two baselines. Most importantly, we showed that most of the time AE baselines, deterministic or probabilistic, have a performance improvement when augmented by our method.\nWe have also provided in our general comment statistics of the improvement rate due to our method over all presented baselines and datasets.\n\n3) With respect to the inpainting evaluation, we have provided in Appendix D a qualitative comparison with the recent work of Ivanov et al, ICLR 2019. The quality of the reconstructions is comparable, even though our VAE is trained without any assumptions over the mask's properties. This comparison was not included in the main text for lack of space.\n\nWe hope that we have answered your concerns, thank you again.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1469/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1469/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Iterative energy-based projection on a normal data manifold for anomaly localization", "authors": ["David Dehaene", "Oriel Frigo", "S\u00e9bastien Combrexelle", "Pierre Eline"], "authorids": ["david@anotherbrain.ai", "oriel@anotherbrain.ai", "sebastien@anotherbrain.ai", "pierre@anotherbrain.ai"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "visual inspection", "unsupervised anomaly detection", "anomaly localization", "autoencoder", "variational autoencoder", "gradient descent", "inpainting"], "TL;DR": "We use gradient descent on a regularized autoencoder loss to correct anomalous images.", "abstract": "Autoencoder reconstructions are widely used for the task of unsupervised anomaly localization.

First, we would like to draw your attention to our  general comment, answering questions about overall baselines for anomaly localization and statistics on the benefits of our method. This comment also explains changes in the last revision of the paper.\n\nWe address here each of your concerns:\n\n- \u00ab\u00a0The major concern is how the quality of f_{VAE} is estimated. From the paper it seems f_{VAE} is not updated. Will it be sufficient to rely a fixed f_{VAE} and blindly trust its quality?\u00a0\u00bb\nFor a full context, we remind that the VAE is first trained on a dataset comprising only normal data,  to obtain an estimate of the probability distribution of normal data. Since it is a standard VAE training, the quality of the model can be assessed using any of the classical techniques (cross validation, visual inspection, etc). During inference, the underlying VAE model\u2019s weights are indeed frozen and the only optimized parameters are the input image\u2019s pixels, in an adversarial example\u2019s fashion. As you suggest, we could potentially update the underlying model with test data identified by our method as normal, as in a continuous learning setup, but we leave this to future work.\n\n- \u00ab\u00a0Table 1: It is not clear how \"the mean improvement rate of 9.52% over all baselines\" was calculated.\u00a0\u00bb\nFollowing your suggestion, we clarified how this metric was calculated, and added a few statistics on the benefits of our method in the last revision. They were computed by aggregating the improvement rate between a baseline and its grad-augmented version $(AUC_{grad} \u2013 AUC_{base}) / AUC_{base}$, over all presented baselines and datasets. \n\n- \u00ab\u00a0Figure 3: Will VAE-grad or DASE-grad perform better? Since these base lines are used in other places, it is better to compare with them as well.\u00a0\u00bb\nWe augmented figure 3 with the three remaining baselines. They show similar results to the L2AE on these images. Due to the lack of space, we added this comparison in appendix C. \n\nWe hope that we have answered your concerns, thank you again for your suggestions."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1469/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1469/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Iterative energy-based projection on a normal data manifold for anomaly localization", "authors": ["David Dehaene", "Oriel Frigo", "S\u00e9bastien Combrexelle", "Pierre Eline"], "authorids": ["david@anotherbrain.ai", "oriel@anotherbrain.ai", "sebastien@anotherbrain.ai", "pierre@anotherbrain.ai"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "visual inspection", "unsupervised anomaly detection", "anomaly localization", "autoencoder", "variational autoencoder", "gradient descent", "inpainting"], "TL;DR": "We use gradient descent on a regularized autoencoder loss to correct anomalous images.", "abstract": "Autoencoder reconstructions are widely used for the task of unsupervised anomaly localization.

We have followed your suggestions in our new revision of the paper and we believe it strengthens its content. We note that reviewers were positive about the significance of our work, that \u00ab\u00a0discusses an important problem of solving the visual inspection problem limited supervision\u00a0\u00bb, and they note that our general approach is \u00ab\u00a0intuitive\u00a0\u00bb, and \u00ab\u00a0[leads] to significantly better results\u00a0\u00bb, while our second idea  \u00ab\u00a0significantly speeds up the model convergence\u00a0\u00bb. Nevertheless, several questions are raised on what constitutes the overall baseline for unsupervised anomaly localization, as well as the need for further statistics on the benefits of our method.\n\n- As the authors of Bergmann et al., 2019, we acknowledge the lack of an overall \u00ab\u00a0best\u00a0\u00bb baseline for anomaly localization, but we want to emphasize that our contribution is a method to increase the performance of any autoencoder-based model.\n\n- Thus, to give a better sense of the overall improvements of our method, we computed the histogram of the improvement rate in AUC between a baseline and its grad-augmented counterpart, over all datasets and over all baseline models. We added this histogram and a short analysis in appendix F. We reported additional statistics of this overall improvement distribution in the main text: the median improvement rate over all baselines and datasets is at 4.33%, the 25th percentile at 1.86% and the 75th percentile at 15.86%.\n\n- We clarified the table of results, highlighting the AUC increase or decrease with colors instead of arrows.\n\n- We augmented figure 3 with the three remaining baselines, which shows similar results to the L2AE. Due to the lack of space, we added this comparison in appendix C. \n\nWe hope that we answered here most of your concerns.

Indeed, an autoencoder trained on normal data is expected to only be able to reconstruct normal features of the data, allowing the segmentation of anomalous pixels in an image via a simple comparison between the image and its autoencoder reconstruction. In practice however, local defects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction, making this segmentation challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose in this paper a new approach for projecting anomalous data on a autoencoder-learned normal data manifold, by using gradient descent on an energy derived from the autoencoder's loss function. This energy can be augmented with regularization terms that model priors on what constitutes the user-defined optimal projection. By iteratively updating the input of the autoencoder, we bypass the loss of high-frequency information caused by the autoencoder bottleneck. This allows to produce images of higher quality than classic reconstructions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on various anomaly localization datasets. It also shows promising results at an inpainting task on the CelebA dataset.", "pdf": "/pdf/53c8526763e4dc77e98e527c4d06bfbbf22b1768.pdf", "paperhash": "dehaene|iterative_energybased_projection_on_a_normal_data_manifold_for_anomaly_localization", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nDehaene2020Iterative,\ntitle={Iterative energy-based projection on a normal data manifold for anomaly localization},\nauthor={David Dehaene and Oriel Frigo and S\u00e9bastien Combrexelle and Pierre Eline},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJx81ySKwr}\n}", "full_presentation_video": "", "original_pdf": "/attachment/84d2d580c6fc3699e877302eb4ecfd0ec0e2cfcf.pdf", "appendix": "", "poster": "", "spotlight_video": "", "slides": ""}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
