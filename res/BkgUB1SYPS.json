Our responses are as follows. \n1. For clarity issues and grammatical errors, we will check and correct them in this paper.\n2. Regarding the relative less explanations of adaptive LSTM, we think that the main contributions are the theoretical analysis about the modeling ability of the contextual dependency, as well as the corresponding interpretable mechanism. Nevertheless, we will add more descriptions about the adaptive LSTM in the revised version of our paper. \n3. For the problem of a dichotomy of tasks, this strategy is inspired by the recent work [2]. This work describes that for those tasks (e.g., NER, POS tagging, and constituency parsing), one needs the hidden vectors of the lower layer, to better capture short-range dependencies than those of the deeper layer.\n4.

The method relies on parametrization of the joint probability of words in (2), and discussed some connections between the rank of the unfolded tensor T and the dependency level between two sets of words in a sentence.\n\nThe goal of this work is quite interesting, but the reviewer feel a bit challenging to follow the writing. The work seems to build upon a previous work, namely, tensor space language model (TSLM). But the paper does not introduce TSLM in detail, making the part relevant to TSLM quite inaccessible.\n\nThe analysis of the work is based on the model in (2), which is merely an approximation for the joint probability. This is fine, but maybe this point should be more spelled out in the paper.\n\nThe work also has an assumption that a naive Bayes model in (4) always holds for a set of w_1 ... w_n. This may need some more discussion and maybe a reference. Since the authors are considering a sequence, this may be related to de finetti's theorem and its extensions. But in that theorem many more assumptions are needed, eg., the RVs are exchangeable. Also, it is unknown if a finite K exists.\n\nThe proof of Claim 1 is a bit trivial, if one only considers one-hot encoding. In fact, the statement and proof of Claim 1 might be a bit loose. If one wishes that the SVD reveals the rank K, K has to be smaller than the outer dimensions of the tensor T. This was not specified in the statement.\n\nThe above also brings up another question: are the proofs all based on one-hot encoding of words? We know in NLP pre-trained word embeddings may be more useful. Do the proofs also apply to those cases, e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec?\n\nDid all the experiments use one-hot embedding?\n\nOverall, the reviewer feels that the work has an interesting motivation, and the goal is meaningful. The writing is a bit hard to access and the proofs might be a bit loose (did not check all of them. But Claim 1 is already a bit loose).\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1692/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1692/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["xindianma@tju.edu.cn", "pzhang@tju.edu.cn", "xiaoliumao@tju.edu.cn", "yehua_zhang@tju.edu.cn", "nanduan@microsoft.com", "yxhou@tju.edu.cn", "mingzhou@microsoft.com"], "title": "Interpretable Network Structure for Modeling Contextual Dependency", "authors": ["Xindian Ma", "Peng Zhang", "Xiaoliu Mao", "Yehua Zhang", "Nan Duan", "Yuexian Hou", "Ming Zhou."], "pdf": "/pdf/ea275408b49d1ca83212d0ca1e93bf607f898f74.pdf", "abstract": "Neural language models have achieved great success in many NLP tasks, to a large extent, due to the ability to capture contextual dependencies among terms in a text.

The analysis is primarily done in the context of tensor space language models (TSLM) that was demonstrated to be a generalisation of n-gram language models in earlier work. The theoretical derivations suggest that increasing a network's depth increases its separation rank exponentially, while increasing its width only increases its separation rank linearly. Based on this finding, the paper proposes a bidirectional adaptive recurrent neural network that adapts the network depth for each task using dynamic halting. Experiments on six NLP tasks demonstrate that increasing network depth helps more for tasks that generally require many long-range dependencies, while increasing network width is generally sufficient for tasks that require mostly short-term dependencies, although I disagree with the paper's dichotomy of tasks with long-term and short-term dependencies (see point 3 below).\n\nOverall, this paper suffers from several serious issues, as listed below. I am therefore recommending a rating of \"Reject\" ahead of the authors' response.\n\n1. This paper suffers from substantial clarity issues beyond simple grammatical errors. Some examples of the most serious clarity issues are as follows: (i) Section 6.1.1 lists \"sentiment analysis\" as one of the tasks, but Figure 2 has no entry for \"sentiment analysis\", yet instead features experimental results for \"semantic classifier\" which was never mentioned or introduced before; and (ii) Figure 2 shows \"1st layer LSTM\", \"2nd layer LSTM\", and \"3rd layer LSTM\", while (based on my reading) what the paper means are \"1-layer LSTM\", \"2-layer LSTM\", and \"3-layer LSTM\", hence highly confusing for the reader.\n\n2. The proposed explanation about the proposed bidirectional adaptive RNN is really sparse, despite being a central part of the paper. The explanation of the proposed model is only contained in two paragraphs (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), and are not sufficient for the readers to understand the model. A more extensive explanation and intuition about what the model is like, and how it is similar or different to TSLM and standard RNNs, is required to improve this.\n\n3. In the experiments, the paper assumes a false dichotomy of tasks that only require short-range dependencies (NER, POS tagging, and constituency parsing), and tasks that require long-range dependencies (WSD, sentiment analysis, and coreference resolution). This dichotomy is overly simplistic and ultimately false. For instance, constituency parsers often need to identify spans that are very long-distance in nature (for a recent investigation of this, see the work by Fried et al. (2019)), while sentiment analysis often only requires the model to identify a few salient words that are indicative of the sentiment, e.g. \"excellent\" or \"terrible\", hence not requiring much contextual dependencies. \n\n4. Related to point 3, a better evaluation is to examine the cases that require long-range dependencies within each task, rather than assuming which tasks require long-range dependencies and which ones do not. An example of this is reporting e.g. constituency parsing performance for long-range spans and coreference resolution performance for long-distance entity chains.\n\n5. The paper mostly fails to report performance comparison with existing numbers from prior work. For instance, the coreference performance (Fig. 2) are far below the result from Lee et al. (2017) that this paper is based on (Section 6.1.1), while the constituency parsing numbers (also Fig. 2) are also far below the reconciled span parser (Joshi et al., 2018) that this paper is also based on. This discrepancy calls into question the strength of the model implementation used in this paper.\n\n6. Some missing citations, e.g. the use of adaptive computation time and dynamic halting in Universal Transformers (Dehghani et al., 2019).\n\n7. This paper can benefit from careful copy-editing. Some examples of grammatical errors: (i) \"Eq. 16\" in Section 5.2 should be \"Eq. 6\", (ii) \"to verify our theoretical, respectively\" in Section 6 should be \"to verify our theoretical [findings/derivations]\", (iii) \"ourself\" on the caption of Table 1 should be \"ourselves\", (iv) \"The model Ling et al. (2015) is used, which using bidirectional LSTMs\" should be \"The model [of] Ling et al. (2015) is used, which [used] bidirectional LSTMs\", etc.\n\nReferences\nDaniel Fried, Nikita Kitaev, and Dan Klein. \"Cross-domain generalization of neural constituency parsers\".
