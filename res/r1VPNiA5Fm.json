The main point of our results here is that deep ReLU networks do provide exponential approximation accuracy and are hence the first approximation method to deliver exponential accuracy. Moreover, the Weierstrass function does not have weak derivatives and possesses H\u00f6lder smoothness which can be infinitely small; it can therefore not be considered an element of a particular H\u00f6lder or Sobolev space. Regarding our other results, we achieve faster approximation rates than the ones obtained for general Sobolev and H\u00f6lder spaces.\n\nThe ReLU network approximation results for functions in the unit ball in Sobolev spaces first obtained in (Yarotsky, 2017) and cited in (Montanelli et al., 2017) show that the number of nonzero weights needed in the approximating ReLU network grows \u201cpolynomially\u201d in the inverse of the approximation error, e.g. O(\\eps^{-d/m} \\log(1/eps)) for W^{m,\\infty}([0,1]^d).\n\nTheorem 5 in (Schmidt-Hieber, 2017) also states that in the approximation of functions in the unit ball in H\u00f6lder spaces, the number of nonzero weights needed in the approximating ReLU network has to grow \u201cpolynomially\u201d in the inverse of the approximation error.\n\nIn contrast, we show\n\n1. Exponential approximation accuracy for highly oscillatory sinusoidal functions (Theorem 4.1), leading to exponential approximation accuracy for oscillatory textures (Proposition 5.2) and the Weierstrass function (Proposition 5.4). Exponential approximation accuracy means that the approximation error decays exponentially in the number of nonzero weights, which is equivalent to the number of nonzero weights required growing \u201clogarithmically\u201d in the inverse approximation error.\n2. Our results are stated for arbitrary domains, in contrast to a restriction to the unit ball in (Yarotsky, 2017), (Montanelli et al., 2017) and (Schmidt-Hieber, 2017). \n3. We establish that the weights in the networks we construct grow no faster than polynomial in the size of the domain over which approximation is carried out, a result that is crucial to be able to conclude exponential approximation accuracy. Such a result is not available in existing work (Yarotsky, 2017), (Montanelli et al., 2017) and (Schmidt-Hieber, 2017).\n\nThese three novel aspects allow us to then conclude that the approximation results we found are best possible in the sense of (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2017).\n\n\n--Major comments--\n\nOn the motivation to focus on specific function classes\n\nWe find these results interesting as they demonstrate that deep ReLU networks can deliver something that to date has not been accomplished, namely to approximate (certain) fractal functions and oscillatory textures with exponential accuracy. We chose these two function classes as they are known to be notoriously hard to approximate. In fact, the best approximation results available in the literature for these function classes exhibit low-order polynomial approximation accuracy, i.e., polynomial error decay as opposed to exponential error decay. \n\nIn practice, the functional dependence a network is to learn is unknown. In this sense our results say that even very unusual functional dependencies can be learned, in fact, optimally so in an approximation-theoretic sense, by a deep ReLU network, thus speaking to the universal approximation capability of deep ReLU networks. \n\nThe results on the approximation of the Weierstrass function can be extended in a straightforward way to certain fractal functions of the same nature, e.g. the Blancmange curve. The generalization to all fractal functions remains an open problem.\n\n\nOn the curse of dimensionality\n\nThe multivariate generalizations of Props. 3.1 & 3.2 follow straightforwardly from the univariate case. For the multivariate generalization of Prop. 3.3 one can show that the width grows linearly, and hence optimally, in the number of dimensions. \n\nThe multivariate generalizations of our results do not suffer from a \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d; in fact, our results exhibit the same qualitative behavior as those reported previously in Prop. 3.3 and Lemma 3.8 in (Schwab&Zech, 2017), which show that the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d can be overcome when approximating polynomials by ReLU networks.\n\nIn addition, it was shown recently in (Grohs et al., 2018)  that deep ReLU networks can approximate certain solution families of parametric PDEs depending on a large (possibly infinite) number of parameters while overcoming the curse of dimensionality."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper11/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper11/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper11/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Universal Approximation Power of Finite-Width Deep ReLU Networks", "abstract": "We show that finite-width deep ReLU neural networks yield rate-distortion optimal approximation (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2018) of a wide class of functions, including polynomials, windowed sinusoidal functions, one-dimensional oscillatory textures, and the Weierstrass function, a fractal function which is continuous but nowhere differentiable.

The entire polynomial p = \\sum_m \\sum_n  a_{m,n} (x - m/N)^n is approximated by a network consisting of parallel subnetworks that approximate the individual p_{m,n}, see the discussion below (18) in Yarotsky (2016). Therefore, the width of the network in Yarotsky (2016) approximating the overall polynomial grows with the number of non-zero coefficients a_{m,n} and hence does not remain constant for arbitrary polynomials, in fact, in the worst case (i.e., all a_{m,n} \\neq 0) it grows with the degree.\n\nWe avoid this network parallelization and the associated width growth by iteratively composing multiplication networks and combining them with a construction that computes higher order monomials together with a lower order polynomial. This construction, to the best of our knowledge, is novel.\n\nWe suppose that the width of 9 as suggested by the reviewer is based on the assumption that multiplication could be implemented by parallelizing 3 networks with skip connections, each of width 3 and approximating x^2. While this might be true for networks with skip connections, it does not apply to our setting where skip-connections are not allowed.\n\n\nOn the cosine approximation\n\nWe would like to point out that the Taylor approximation was only a minor part of the proof. The main idea in the proof of Theorem 4.1 is a novel approach which shows how Telgarsky\u2019s and Yarotsky\u2019s \u201csawtooth construction\u201d can be used to approximate sinusoidal functions with networks of depth scaling logarithmically in the frequency of the sinusoid. Applying the Taylor expansion straightforwardly as suggested by the reviewer would lead to network weights growing with the frequency of the sinusoid, which would, in turn, lead to a weight growth that violates the weight growth behavior we require to be able to conclude rate-distortion optimality in the sense of (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2017).\n\n\nOn the skip-connections and improving on the existing results\n\nAll the results in our paper, indeed, apply to networks without skip connections, see Def. 2.1.\n\nPropositions 3.1-3.3 go beyond Yarotsky\u2019s work as follows:\n1. (Props. 3.1 & 3.2) The approximating networks for the squaring and multiplication operations we construct do not need skip connections.\n2. (Prop. 3.3) Our results are stated for arbitrary domains, in contrast to a restriction to the unit ball in (Yarotsky, 2017).\n3. (Prop. 3.3) The approximating network we construct has fixed width, independently of the degree of the polynomial it approximates. In contrast, the width of the approximating network in (Yarotsky, 2016) scales with the order of the polynomial.\n4. (Prop.  3.2) We establish that the weights in the multiplication network we construct grow no faster than polynomial in the size of the domain over which approximation is carried out. This allows us to then conclude that our approximating network provides exponential approximation accuracy and is hence best possible in an approximation-theoretic sense (see (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2017)).\n\n\nOn the Sections 5 and 6\n\nThe main idea in the proof of Theorem 4.1 is a novel approach which shows how Telgarsky\u2019s and Yarotsky\u2019s \u201csawtooth construction\u201d can be used to approximate sinusoidal functions with networks of depth scaling logarithmically in the frequency of the sinusoid. Applying the Taylor expansion straightforwardly as suggested by the reviewer would lead to network weights growing with the frequency of the sinusoid, which would, in turn, lead to a weight growth that violates the weight growth behavior we require to be able to conclude rate-distortion optimality in the sense of (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2017).\n\nIn Section 5, we show that Theorem 4.1 leads to exponential approximation rates and rate-distortion optimality in the sense of (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2017) for oscillatory textures (Proposition 5.2) and for the Weierstrass function (Proposition 5.4), both of which are known to be poorly approximated by classical methods. In fact, the best known approximation results exhibit polynomial approximation rates only.\n\n\nOn the existing work on finite-width networks (Hanin&Sellke, 2017) and (Yarotsky, 2018)\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out these references, which, indeed, contain results on finite-width approximations of continuous functions. In contrast to our results, these results do, however, not say anything about the depth of the approximating networks and do not provide  bounds on their weights\u2019 magnitudes. These aspects are important, as it is the very combination of finite width, depth scaling poly-logarithmically in 1/\\eps, and weights growing no faster than polynomially in 1/\\eps that guarantees rate-distortion optimality in the sense of B\u00f6lcskei et al. (2017) and consequently exponential error decay\n\nWe will cite the papers mentioned by the reviewer in the revised version of the paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper11/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper11/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper11/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Universal Approximation Power of Finite-Width Deep ReLU Networks", "abstract": "We show that finite-width deep ReLU neural networks yield rate-distortion optimal approximation (B\u00f6lcskei et al., 2018) of a wide class of functions, including polynomials, windowed sinusoidal functions, one-dimensional oscillatory textures, and the Weierstrass function, a fractal function which is continuous but nowhere differentiable.

This result itself is quite simple and mostly follows from simple observations or known results, though it is possible that these have not been explicitly written in this form anywhere. The other results concern smooth functions, and some kinds of non-smooth functions such as the Weirstrass function. There are two neat observations (i) using the sawtooth function to approximate sinusoidal ones and (ii) using overlapping \"approximation\" to simulate an indicator. \n******************************************************************************************\n\n\nWe see the following novel elements in our paper.\n\nProposition 3.3: \n\n1) We do not need skip connections, in contrast to (Yarotsky, 2016).\n2) Our results are stated for arbitrary domains, in contrast to a restriction to the unit cube in (Yarotsky, 2016).\n3) The approximating network we construct has fixed width 16, independently of the degree of the polynomial it approximates. In contrast, the width of the approximating network in (Yarotsky, 2016) scales with the order of the polynomial.\n4) We establish that the weights in the approximation network we construct grow no faster than polynomial in the size of the domain over which approximation is carried out.

For example, for polynomials, the statement \u201cthe width of the approximating network does not grow with the degree of the polynomial as is the case in Yarotsky (2016)...\u201d does not seem true. The constructions in Yarotsky (2016) which much of the present work appears to be based on, in fact, allow for a constant-width approximation of polynomials of degree \u201cn\u201d in \u201cd\u201d-variables, over the cube, with \n\nwdith = 9, and depth ~ m \\log m [\\log (1/\\eps) + \\log m] where m = n + d. (*)\n\nThis bound is quite similar to Prop. 3.3 (with maybe even sharper dependence on \u201cm\u201d: m(\\log m)^2 versus m^2 in the paper. PS. I would also  double-check C in Prop. 3.3 which could be growing logarithmically in m.)\n\n(*) can be seen by inspecting the arguments around (14)-(15) in Yarotsky (2016) and noting that c_1 ~ \\log m in that argument. For example, considering d=1 which is the focus of the present paper, Yarotsky (2016) shows a constant-width approximation to the product function (x,y) \\mapsto xy which can be used to build a constant width-approximation to the monomial of the highest degree in the polynomial by recursive composition. All other monomials can be accessed serially at various depths of that architecture.\n\n- Much of the subsequent results in the paper are based on this constant-width approximation of polynomials as the authors point out. This is not that surprising given the Taylor approximation. For example, in Theorem 4.1, the first few lines of the proof show that the cosine can be approximated with a polynomial of degree m = O(\\log (1/\\eps)). Combining this with the polynomial approximation result one gets a constant-width approximation with \ndepth ~ \\log(1/\\eps)^2 or \\log(1\\eps)^2 \\log \\log (1/\\eps) \ndepending which version of the polynomial approximation result one believes (m \\log m versus m as the prefactor as discussed above).  In other words, it appears to me that the proof of Theorem 4.1 can be shortened considerably. It would be a corollary of the polynomial approximation. \n\n- A novelty of the present work over Yarotsky (2016) that the authors point out is avoiding skip connections in Proposition 3.1. (Perhaps this is true also for Prop. 3.3? Not discussed.) I haven\u2019t checked the details here, but assuming correctness, I agree that it is quite interesting. I am not sure however if it is a significant improvement over the existing results.\n\n- The discussion of Section 5 and 6 might be new in this context and somewhat interesting.

The function classes explored in this paper are: 1-d polynomials (on bounded intervals), 1-d sinusoidal functions (on bounded intervals), and other 1-d functions built from compositions or linear combinations of these, such as the so-called class of \u201coscillatory textures\u201d and a class of continuous but nowhere differentiable functions known as Weierstrass functions. Finally, the paper also shows that as the desired approximation accuracy goes to zero finite-width deep ReLU networks require asymptotically fewer neurons than finite-depth wide ReLU networks in approximating a broad class of smooth functions.\n\n\nThe paper is well-written and the technical results are presented in a way that is easy to understand. The results are somewhat novel, although they do build off other recent works, namely Yarotsky (2016) and Telgarsky (2015). However, the authors were careful to cite when they reuse proof techniques from these and other works. The results in the main text appear to be technically sound. I did not check carefully all the proofs in the supplemental materials.\n\n\nMy major criticism is that the focus on certain specific function classes (oscillatory textures, Weierstrauss functions) seems arbitrary, and leaves open many questions. For example, there is existing work on the approximation ability of deep ReLU networks for functions in more general Holder and Sobolev spaces:\n\nHadrien Montanelli and Qiang Du. Deep ReLU networks lessen the curse of dimensionality. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.08688, 2017.\n\nJ. Schmidt-Hieber. Nonparametric regression using deep neural networks with ReLU activation function. ArXiv e-prints, August 2017.\n\nI was left wondering how the present results relate to these works, and what insight we get from understanding these particular function classes that we don't get from understanding Holder or Sobolev spaces.\n\n\nMajor comments\n\n\nIn Section 3, I found the progression of the results from approximation of x^2, to multiplication xy, and to general smooth functions to be very natural and well-motivated. However, sections 4 and 5 seem lack somewhat in motivation, since here the authors focus on very specific function classes (sinusoidal functions, oscillatory textures, and Weierstrass functions). While these results are still interesting, focusing on such specific functions is less satisfactory, since it raises questions about the true scope of the results (e.g., will similar approximation rates extend to other fractal functions, or just Weierstrauss functions?). Could the authors give further justification for why these function classes are interesting to focus on, or why they limit themselves in this way? Can the authors also put these results more into context with existing results on the approximation with ReLU networks?\n\n\nThe authors state multiple times that \u201call our results apply to the multivariate case\u201d but that they restrict themselves to the univariate case for simplicity of presentation. While this is fine, some indication of how the results are altered in the multivariate case would be useful. For example, does the fixed-width M in multivariate generalizations of Prop 3.1--3.3 need to be bigger, smaller, or the same? What other constants are dimensionally dependent? Do the multivariate generalization of their results bear the \"curse of dimensionality\", i.e., does the number of neurons needed to reach epsilon accuracy depend geometrically on the dimension?\n\nMinor comments\n\n\nA conclusion or discussion section summarizing the overall technical contribution would be useful for the reader. Also, it would be useful to include some discussion on remaining open problems or future work.\n\nOn pg. 2, the authors state \u201cthe approximation results throughout the paper guarantee that the magnitude of the weights in the network does not grow faster than polynomially in the cardinality of of the domain over which the approximation takes place\u201d. What does \u201ccardinality of the domain\u201d here mean? I think the authors mean the size D of the interval [-D,D] over which the approximation is valid.\n\nOn pg. 7, the authors say \u201cWe note that this result allows to show that local cosine bases (cite) can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with exponential error decay\u2026\u201d. I think the authors mean to say \u201c...this result allows us to show\u2026\u201d or \u201cthis result allows one to show\u2026\u201d. Although it\u2019s not clear to me whether this means it has been shown (it\u2019s a direct corollary), or could possible be shown (it\u2019s a corollary, but needs some non-trivial work).
