You're correct, a mixed derivative -- in both x (image) and theta (parameters) is computed. Our implementation was easily done in PyTorch, simply by running autograd twice - first in x to get the norm gradient, then in theta. In practice we found that networks trained with this Lipschitz penalty took no longer than four times the training time of an unregularized network.

The authors show that this training loss can be interpreted as a form of adversarial training against optimal L2 and L_infinity adversarial perturbations. This augmented training effectively reduces the Lipschitz constant of the network, leading to improved robustness against a wide variety of attack algorithms.\n\nWhile I believe the results are correct and possibly significant, the paper is poorly written (especially for a 10 page submission) and comparison with prior work on reducing the Lipschitz constant of the network is lacking. The authors also made little to no effort in writing to ensure the clarity of their paper. I would like to see a completely reworked draft before opening to the idea of recommending acceptance.\n\nPros:\n- Theoretically intuitive method for improving the model's robustness.\n- Evaluation against a wide variety of attacks.\n- Empirically demonstrated improvement over traditional adversarial training.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of comparison to prior work. The authors are aware of numerous techniques for controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network for improved robustness, but did not compare to them at all.\n- Poorly written. The paper contains multiple missing figure references, has a duplicated table (Tables 1 and 3), and the method is not explained well. I am confused as to how the 2-Lip loss is minimized. Also, the paper organization seems very chaotic and incoherent, e.g., the introduction section contains many technical details that would better belong in related works or methods sections.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nRevision:\n\nI thank the authors for incorporating my suggestions and reworking the draft, and I have updated my rating in response to the revision. While I believe the organization is much cleaner and easier to follow, there is still much room for improvement. In particular, the paper does not introduce concepts in a logical order for a non-expert to follow (e.g. Reviewer 1) and leaps into the paper's core idea too quickly. I am strongly in favor of exceeding the suggested page limit of 8 pages and using that space to address these concerns.\n\nA more pressing concern is the evaluation of prior work. The authors added a short section (Section 5.4) comparing their method to that of (Qian and Wegman, 2018). This is certainly a reasonable comparison and the results seem promising, the evaluation lacks an important dimension -- varying the value of epsilon and observing the change in robustness. This is an important aspect for defenses against adversarial examples as certain defense may be less robust but are insensitive to the adversary's strength. Showing the robustness across different adversary strengths gives a more informative view of the authors' proposed method in comparison to others. The evaluation is also lacking in breadth, ignoring other similar defenses such as (Cisse et al., 2017) and (Gouk et al., 2018).", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper667/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Improved robustness to adversarial examples using Lipschitz regularization of the loss", "abstract": "We augment adversarial training (AT) with worst case adversarial training\n(WCAT) which improves adversarial robustness by 11% over the current state-\nof-the-art result in the `2-norm on CIFAR-10.

For example in polynomial interpolation it typically it suffices to show a particular method has error epsilon^(n+1) with a n-th degree polynomial. We have shown that adversarial training is equivalent to Total Variation minimization, up to order epsilon^2, where epsilon is the size of the adversarial perturbation. This means that when epsilon is small, as is typical (our epsilon is 0.01),  the two methods are nearly equivalent.  By equivalent,  lossely speaking, we mean that replacing one term with another should lead to results which are very close.

Prior work has focused on controlling the estimate of the Lipschitz constant using the product of norms of weight matrices.

We have posted a new draft of the manuscript. Following AnonReviewer2\u2019s comments, we have completely reworked the draft. We have attempted to communicate our ideas and results as clearly as possible. We hope that the paper is accessible to persons outside the field of adversarial attacks as well, such as AnonReviewer1.\n\nWe would like to highlight the merits of our results. \n\n1. We achieve state-of-the-art results when measuring attacks in the 2-norm, improving by 11% over the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10. Following off line conversations with some of our colleagues, we have also analyzed our results in the max-norm as well. In the max-norm, we are on par with the current state-of-the-art (Madry et al (2017)). However we did not focus our efforts on the max-norm, so we believe with a bit more effort our results could possibly be improved, for example if we had used multi-step adversarial training like in Madry et al (we only used one-step adversarial training).\n\n2. Our implementation of Lipschitz regularization is novel and an improvement to existing results in terms of both accuracy (by orders of magnitude) and efficiency (we can leverage the gradients already used in adversarial training). Training networks by penalizing with estimates of the Lipschitz constant have in the past used the product of weight matrix norms. However this estimate of the Lipschitz constant grows exponentially in the number of layers. As such the estimate is intractable for deep networks. In contrast, our method provides a more accurate estimate, which we demonstrate is closer in magnitude to the true value of the Lipschitz constant.\n\n3. We believe that our interpretation of adversarial training will be interesting and useful to the community. We show that adversarial training is a form of Total Variation regularization, which has been used successfully outside the deep learning community in image preprocessing to denoise images. We believe that this is a useful insight that could be leveraged further in the future. \n\n4. We obtain novel average case and worst case robustness bounds, which we verify empirically.  These bounds allow use to predict adversarial robustness based on the statistics of quantities we can read off of the trained model.

Following this suggestion, we have re-generated all the tables and figures in L-infinity.\n\nFor example, our main results are presented in Table 1, where we report median adversarial distance and percent error at a fixed adversarial distance. Here is Table 1 with distances in L-infinity. We report percent misclassified at adversiarial distance 1/16 (rather than 0.1) to more easily compare with other literature's results.\n\nDataset     defense method     median distance    % err at eps=1/16\n\nCIFAR-10    J0 (baseline)                            1.02e-2                          99.92\n                    J1 (AT, FGSM)                          2.12e-2                          96.06\n                    J2 (AT, L2)                                3.45e-2                          84.76\n                   J2-Lip & tanh                            6.00e-2                          51.64\n\nCIFAR-100   J0 (baseline)                           5.83e-3                          99.61\n                     J1 (AT, FGSM)                         1.07e-2                          98.46\n                     J2 (AT, L2)                               1.06e-2                           98.03\n                    J2-Lip & tanh                           1.60e-2                           93.73\n\nWe hope this updated table is useful during the review process.
