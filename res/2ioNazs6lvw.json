While we did not consider non-image settings in our paper, we expect our model to be trivially extended to voxel grids.  However, the unstructured data case is much more complicated since it cannot benefit from the fast convolutions of our deep convolutional network.\n2. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we now provide a comparison with (Claici et al., 2018) in part 4, figure 3. However note that this method is extremely slow: a typical run time we achieved using Claici et al.\u2019s public implementation was 14 hours of computation for a barycenter of two measures consisting of 50 Dirac masses, and 37 hours for 100 Dirac masses when using 2 images from the QuickDraw dataset (while our method works with images that contains 2621 times more data and produces results in milliseconds). This gives the opportunity to emphasize the difficulty of the problem we are tackling.\n3. Only the synthetic dataset is considered for the training of our model ; however we provide examples of results on different datasets : Quick Draw, simple shapes (circles, lines) and to answer to the concerns of the reviewer we have now also added comparisons with the COIL20 dataset. \n4. The figure which was at the end of page 6 now corresponds to figure 4. It has been revised and we provide additional results inside it in order to allow a comparison with the DWE model for a number of input distributions greater than 2. Note that this visualization is standard in data analysis, and has been notably used by [Courty et al. 2017] which we compare to.\n5. While inception scores do not seem relevant in our context as, to the best of our knowledge, they are tailored for GANs, the advice of the reviewer to provide other metrics is fair. We thus provide an additional figure together with the figure 4, which measures errors in terms of L1 distance. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3117/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3117/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to generate Wasserstein barycenters", "authorids": ["~Julien_Lacombe1", "~Julie_Digne1", "~Nicolas_Courty1", "~Nicolas_Bonneel1"], "authors": ["Julien Lacombe", "Julie Digne", "Nicolas Courty", "Nicolas Bonneel"], "keywords": ["Wasserstein barycenters", "Optimal Transport"], "abstract": "Optimal transport is a notoriously difficult problem to solve numerically, with current approaches often remaining intractable for very large scale applications such as those encountered in machine learning.

Sinkhorn divergences are meant to be an improvement over classic regularization methods and are thus expected to provide sharper Wasserstein barycenters. We added in figure 2 a visual comparison with entropic regularized Wasserstein barycenters, computed using the Sinkhorn algorithm with log-domain computations (as described e.g. in Peyr\u00e9 & Cuturi\u2019s book). \nAbout \u201ceasy combinations\u201d: for each image of our dataset, we precompute one approximate optimal transport map between a uniform distribution and the image itself. We can then combine $n$ pre-computed optimal transport maps corresponding to $n$ images in order to obtain several approximate Wasserstein barycenters at no additional cost. However, this \u201ceasy combination\u201d is only possible when using a single gradient step and does not apply when the number of gradient steps is higher than one. If we had used 2 or more gradient steps, we would have had to compute optimal transport maps each time we compute a Wasserstein barycenter, which would be intractable for building a large training dataset. \n\nMinor Remarks:\n- The figure which was on page 6 now corresponds to figure 4 and it has been corrected and enhanced. \n- The typo has been corrected. \n- As stated in section 4.1, we consider 2 versions of DWE : the original architecture which can handle only 28x28 images and a modified architecture well suited for 512x512 images. The encoder and decoder of this last version have the same architecture as the contractive and expansive paths used in our model. In figure 5 our model takes 512x512 inputs and its results are downsampled in 28x28 images while DWE takes downsampled 28x28 inputs and returns 28x28 results. In figure 6, there is no downsampling and the 2 models directly take 512x512 inputs. We clarified the associated parts in section 4.1.

The production of Wasserstein Barycenters via more exact methods - such as linear programs or e.g. via Claici et al.\u2019s method - remains computationally highly expensive. We provide some visual comparisons between our approximated Wasserstein barycenters and ones generated by these more exact methods (a visual comparison with Claici et al. barycenters has been added, figure 3), but a numerical analysis would require a high number of Wasserstein barycenters produced with exact methods, which would be computationally intractable. \nA typical run time we achieved using Claici et al.\u2019s public implementation was 14 hours of computation for a barycenter of two measures consisting of 50 Dirac masses, and 37 hours for 100 Dirac masses when using 2 images from the QuickDraw dataset.\n2. The use of OT as a loss in our network would also have been computationally expensive and intractable. Fast OT approximations such as Sliced OT may seem an interesting replacement of KL divergence, however our preliminary results with sliced OT were not promising with our model so we did not consider it further. \n3. Our method computes approximate Wasserstein barycenters learnt from a dataset of approximate Wasserstein barycenters computed with Sinkhorn divergences obtained with a small regularization parameter of 1e-4.  Sinkhorn divergences are meant to be an improvement over classic regularization methods and are thus expected to provide sharper Wasserstein barycenters. We added in figure 2 a visual comparison with entropic regularized wasserstein barycenters, computed using the Sinkhorn algorithm with log-domain computations (as described e.g. in Peyr\u00e9 & Cuturi\u2019s book). Note that regularizing optimal transport with entropy has been shown to improve Wasserstein barycenters over exact methods such as linear programs (e.g., Cuturi & Peyr\u00e9 2016, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02533.pdf , Fig. 3.1 and 3.2).\n4. We believe our method can provide initialization points to iterative methods such as the one adopted in (Claici et al., 2018). We think it could be interesting to investigate this in a future work. \n5. Some variants of our architecture have also been considered, in particular : depth of the network, number of layers per level, downsampling with max-pooling, down-sampling and up-sampling with convolutions only, Batch Normalization instead of Instance Normalization. The architecture we present is the one which has empirically shown the best results among the considered configurations. \n6. Unfortunately, linear programs are out of reach for problem sizes handled by our network. A typical barycenter of two 512x512 images would require storing a 512^4 matrix of floating point values, requiring 512 GB of RAM.

The paper is clearly written and presents a fairly objective view on their work. It gives one more example of optimization task (here the convex minimization problem of Wasserstein barycenters) that can be replaced by deep neural networks with seemingly satisfactory results.\nOverall, although the method is relatively straightforward, it has the merit of showing that fast approximations of linear approximations of Wasserstein barycenters can be performed at a cheap forward pass cost of a U-Net. Note that the method has no built-in information on the structure of the problem e.g. preservation of total mass for instance or more higher-level properties.  These fast approximations could be proven to be useful in other settings outside machine learning too.\n\nThe benefit of the proposed architecture is that it can be adapted to compute the barycenters for any given number N of inputs while only trained on pairs (N =2) of input measures. Apart from minor modifications in the pipeline, the architecture remains close to that of a U-Net with the modification that the barycenters weights are explicitly used to compute averages of the activations at different layers of the Deep CNN. This work is quite weak in terms of novelty (structure of the network for instance).\n\nThe experiments are compared against and trained with the GeomLoss code which seems to be state of the art for computing entropic regularity. They also compare with Wasserstein embeddings methods favorably. \n\n\u2014 References to literature in using deep learning for solving inverse problems would be welcome. Wasserstein barycenter is a particular instance of such class.\n\n\u2014 Comments on the sensitivity of the results to training data would be welcome.\n\n\u2014 I find the description of the algorithm for building the training data quite unclear. If I understand correctly, the training data is an approximation of Wasserstein barycenters between two measures. These approximations are simply computed with one step of the gradient descent of the Sinkhorn divergence and use an average of the corresponding transport maps. The cost of computation of these approximate barycenters are essentially two sinkhorn loops up to the given tolerance. This would have been interesting to have a comparison, in the supplementary material, of the difference between these approximations and more accurate approximations of Wasserstein barycenters such as given by entropic regularization with very small regularization parameter and discuss in more details what can be the impact of such inaccuracies. The authors say \u00ab\u00a0While using more iterations of gradient descent yields more accurate results and removes this linearity, it also prevents easy combination and makes the dataset generation intractable\u00a0\u00bb.\u00a0I do not understand this statement. Cost of the gradient descent linearly scales with the number of steps, so what do the authors mean by \u00ab\u00a0easy combination\u00a0\u00bb, the linear approximation step ?\n\nMinor remarks: \n\u2014 the (not numbered) figure on page 6 called adjacent is almost impossible to read and it is not explained enough.\n\u2014 \u00a0A dot is missing after KL-divergence on page 6.\n\u2014 Why is DWE performing so badly in figure 3 in comparison with figure 4 ?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3117/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3117/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning to generate Wasserstein barycenters", "authorids": ["~Julien_Lacombe1", "~Julie_Digne1", "~Nicolas_Courty1", "~Nicolas_Bonneel1"], "authors": ["Julien Lacombe", "Julie Digne", "Nicolas Courty", "Nicolas Bonneel"], "keywords": ["Wasserstein barycenters", "Optimal Transport"], "abstract": "Optimal transport is a notoriously difficult problem to solve numerically, with current approaches often remaining intractable for very large scale applications such as those encountered in machine learning.

Results are compared with other approximation methods.\n\nReason for my score:\n\nThis paper is ell written, and the idea is interesting.  However, the elephant in the room is: How close are these learned barycenters from the actual barycenter? For me this is the main question, that cannot be answered with CNN approaches, and thus, makes it difficult to translate into uses for optimal transport techniques. This limits the impact that the paper can have on a broader audience.\n\nThe authors made a great effort to provide a rather complete review of the literature, and the provided experiments are sound. However.\n\n1. The comparison of the results is made against another approximating method. Again, I would like to see some evidence that the learned model is actually generating good approximations of the Wasserstein Barycenter.\n\n2. It is a less exciting if the loss function used is not OT itself but KL.\n\n3. The main advantage of entropy regularized methods is that one can actually control how close the computed WB is from the actual WB. This is a main issue. In the proposed method, we have no way to know this, and I cannot avoid thinking this is just an informed guess.\n\n4. I believe one main advantage of the proposed method would be to generate initialization points of entropy regularized approaches.\n\n5. The proposed architecture is well explained. Why not other architecture, some experiments exploring other ways would be appreciated as well.\n\n6. For some basic distributions it would have been more useful to compare the learned barycenter with the output of the linear program. At least in a couple of cases.
