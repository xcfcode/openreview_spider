The authors train VAEs with this bound and report performance improvements over the ELBO, but not the IWAE bound.\n\nThe paper has issues with clarity, and rigor, but is overall a reasonable contribution.\n\nSpecific Feedback:\n\n1. The derivation of the q-deformed lower bounds is lacking in rigor. The new bounds are just stated by swapping the q-logarithm for the standard logarithm without discussing whether that is possible. A proof that the new bound is a valid lower bound would be useful.\n\n2. Similarly, it is not clear if swapping in the q-logarithm gives a lower bound on the log likelihood of the data (q=1) or the q-deformed log likelihood of the data for a specific value of q. The latter seems more likely. If that is the case, a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of optimizing a lower bound on the q-deformed log likelihood of the data would be helpful to the reader.\n\n3. In the actual training procedure the authors optimize bounds with different values of q for each batch. An argument should be made that this procedure is still optimizing a valid lower bound on the (possibly q-deformed) log likelihood.\n\n4. The optimization procedure for q is not clearly stated. It seems like q* is set to make the qELBO evaluated with q=q^* match qELBO* as closely as possible. So perhaps the optimization procedure attempts to minimize (qELBO* - qELBO(q=q*))^2 w.r.t. q*. This should be stated clearly, and the optimization procedure should be clearly motivated.\n\n5. In evaluation, what method is used to estimate log \\hat{p}_x?\n\n", "rating": "3: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper9/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper9/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Variational autoencoders trained with q-deformed lower bounds", "authors": ["Septimia S\u00e2rbu", "Luigi Malag\u00f2"], "authorids": ["septimia.sarbu@gmail.com"], "keywords": ["variational autoencoders", "ELBO", "IWAE", "q-deformed logarithm", "tight bounds"], "TL;DR": "Using the q-deformed logarithm, we derive tighter bounds than IWAE, to train variational autoencoders.", "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been successful at learning a low-dimensional manifold from high-dimensional data with complex dependencies.
