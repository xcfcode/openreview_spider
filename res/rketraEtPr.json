The key advantage of this approach is that it directly integrates an NN model for the proposed correction with a numerical solver to be improved. This also means that, in fact, you do not need to provide the reference state s_H since we can also integrate an advanced solver with a higher resolution configuration and acquire the reference data on the fly. Nevertheless, it is natural to precompute the reference data since it is very time consuming. We reused the reference data for our target problem; however, this is not a prerequisite.\n\nYes, beta=0 is a typo; it should be beta=1 instead. Thank you for the suggestions.

We would like to address your concerns in the following.\n\nAlthough we demonstrated our approach with a particular example, i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations in the paper, our correction approach is not limited to this domain. A variety of PDE problems and their numerical solvers share the same goal for better accuracy and better efficiency, and the proposed approach can be generally applicable to those problems. We demonstrated our correction approach within two very different types of fluid flows, i.e., smoke and liquid. The fluid flows that we target with our work are a particularly complex and relevant problem.\n\nAs you point out, a set of NN-based methods were proposed to achieve enhanced results for similar problems; one popular approach is super-resolution. Such a super-resolution approach synthesizes the fine details based on the low resolution input, which is left unmodified and potentially inaccurate due to the limited resolution. On the other hand, our approach directly assists (i.e., corrects) the given numerical solver itself such that its solving accuracy improves with respect to the reference solver\u2019s solution. As we show in our paper, the evolution of smoke in the reference simulation significantly differs from its basic version. Our approach is orthogonal to such a posteriori methods like super-resolution algorithms, and thus both could be used together to yield further improvements.\n\nThe hyperparameter beta in our supervised approach tries to balance between the quality of correction and the difficulty of learning task by an NN model. In our experiments, the NN model failed to learn the correction dataset for beta=0. On the other hand, for beta=10, the quality of ground truth correction deteriorated, which is why we empirically chose beta=1. We would be happy to add these experiments and the discussion to our paper.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper530/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper530/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Time-Aware Assistance Functions for Numerical Fluid Solvers", "authors": ["Kiwon Um", "Yun (Raymond) Fei", "Philipp Holl", "Nils Thuerey"], "authorids": ["kiwon.um@tum.de", "yf2320@columbia.edu", "philipp.holl@tum.de", "nils.thuerey@tum.de"], "keywords": ["PDEs", "convolutional neural networks", "numerical simulation", "fluids"], "TL;DR": "We introduce a neural network approach to assist partial differential equation solvers.", "abstract": "Improving the accuracy of numerical methods remains a central challenge in many disciplines and is especially important for nonlinear simulation problems.

It lists two approaches: (1) compute correction in high resolution simulation from reference states, convert to low-resolution correction, and train NN to predict low-res correction (optionally with temporal regularization, and (2) directly simulate forward using correction prediction and differentiable PDE solver and optimize to match the given reference states. It shows empirical results on better approximating fluid flow simulation. \n\nThe paper tackles an important problem of using NN to speed up expensive simulation computations. The main limitation appears to be the significance of machine learning approaches. Approach (1) is a naive prediction using NN, and approach (2) involves interesting differentiation through PDEs, but that\u2019s directly borrowed from another concurrent anonymized submission. This paper alone does not seem to have enough novel ML contributions for acceptance. \n\nThe writing can benefit from more clarity and better structure. For example,\n- Write prediction as \\hat{c}_L(s) to show what is input for the NN\n- Put definition for c_H in Section 3.1. It seems to be based on v_R and v_B but would benefit from being explicit. \n- If beta=0 is used, why do you need Section 3.2? Is it a typo?\n- In Section 3.3, I am unsure if it should be called unsupervised, as you are given reference state s_H. How is the assumption different from Sections 3.1 and 3.2?
