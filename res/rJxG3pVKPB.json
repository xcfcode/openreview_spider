The paper contains significant flaws both in its writing and its experimental setup.\n\n1) Authors write: \"For example in human activity logs, the video data can be missing in bathrooms by ethical reasons but can be supplied by environmental sensors which have less ethical problems.\". I believe that this statement is completely irrelevant to the paper.\n\n2) Authors write: \"The straight-forward extension does not apply by two reasons: (1) the lengths of x and y are radically different, and (2) both x and y are high dimensionals.\" This statement is not justified and to the contrary of authors statement there has been recent work on wave2wave modeling including end-to-end speech-to-speech neural translation by Jia et al 2019, Liu et al 2019.\n\n3) Authors write: \"CNN is relatively weak in handling time-series data.\" Again this statement is not justified and to the contrary there has been work by Gehring et al 2017 showing success of CNNs in neural machine translation and Bai et al 2018 showing success of Temporal Convolutional Nets on various sequence modeling tasks. \n\n4) Several typos in the paper: Reccurent -> Recurrent on page 2, informaion -> information on page 5\nI believe that this paper is far from worthy of being considered to be accepted by ICLR.\n\n5) Authors claim that they learn several inverse function R^{-1} to capture target waves. On the first glance it may seem that they invert the same weight matrix used for learning source waves R, however upon closer inspection it seems that they learn separate weight matrices for source and target weights which makes inverse notation very confusing.\n\n6) I believe experimental setup is flawed. Authors consider the tasks that are not used by the community which makes it impossible to compare their method to related literature. Furthermore it is not clear to me how capturing the sequence semi-autoregressively (by modeling chunks of waves) produces such as big boost over vanilla sequence to sequence baseline."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper773/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper773/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tsuyoshi.okita@gmail.com", "hirotaka.hachiya@riken.jp", "sozo.inoue@riken.jp", "naonori.ueda@riken.jp"], "title": "Translation Between Waves,  wave2wave", "authors": ["Tsuyoshi Okita", "Hirotaka Hachiya", "Sozo Inoue", "Naonori Ueda"], "pdf": "/pdf/c1cf16608e4afb5fc2dae7da5e2af9294ef47463.pdf", "abstract": "The understanding of sensor data has been greatly improved by advanced deep learning methods with big data.

The authors name this particular application of seq2seq the wave2wave network. Given a multivariate time series covering a time interval, it is split into subintervals of equal length, such that each block is a matrix. This matrix becomes an input into a recurrent encoder. On the decoder side, the similar matrix is produced at the output. The proposed neural network is tested on two data sets: an earthquake and activity translation.\nStrenghts:\n+ application on activity translation and evaluation by human raters is interesting\n+ the proposed work is a nice application of an encoder-decoder architecture in case of multivariate time series\nWeaknesses:\n- there is no methodological novelty. The proposed network uses a standard architecture and the authors use straightforward partitioning of the signal in equal-sized windows. Due to this, inventing a new name wave2wave is not fully justified.\n- the paper has many grammar mistakes and typos (for example, first sentence in the introduction seems to miss a few words). The writing is vague and imprecise and occasionally interferes with understanding. It would be important for the authors to carefully proofread the paper for language and clarity of presentation.\n- the experimental results are not explained in a sufficient detail. I did not understand what is the objective of the earthquake application and how does the data set looks like (e.g., what do you mean by \u201c365 x 3 training data\u201d). The details of experimental design, architecture and hyperparameter choice are not provided in the earthquake application. It is not clear what the authors mean by \u201csimple encoder-decoder\u201d and \u201csimple seq2seq\u201d, I guess those are some baselines. For the activity application, it would be useful to see some illustration of the neural network output when video is predicted from motion capture. It would help to clarify the accuracy measures \u2013 perplexity and human understability. How many humans were involved in rating and what were they asked to do? How did the humans rate the non-video outputs?\n\nOverall, given the quality of writing and lack of methodological novelty this paper is not ready for publication."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper773/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper773/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["tsuyoshi.okita@gmail.com", "hirotaka.hachiya@riken.jp", "sozo.inoue@riken.jp", "naonori.ueda@riken.jp"], "title": "Translation Between Waves,  wave2wave", "authors": ["Tsuyoshi Okita", "Hirotaka Hachiya", "Sozo Inoue", "Naonori Ueda"], "pdf": "/pdf/c1cf16608e4afb5fc2dae7da5e2af9294ef47463.pdf", "abstract": "The understanding of sensor data has been greatly improved by advanced deep learning methods with big data.

This paper proposes a new variant of neural machine translation seq2seq to deal with continuous signal waves by introducing the window-based (inverse-) representation to adaptively represent partial shapes of waves and the iterative back-translation model for high-dimensional data.  Experimental results are shown for two real-life data: earthquake and activity translation.  The performance improvements of one-dimensional data was about 46 % in test loss and that of high-dimensional data was about 1625 % in perplexity with regard to the original seq2seq.\n", "keywords": ["sequence to sequence model", "signal to signal", "deep learning", "RNN", "encoder-decoder model"], "paperhash": "okita|translation_between_waves_wave2wave", "original_pdf": "/attachment/c1cf16608e4afb5fc2dae7da5e2af9294ef47463.pdf", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nokita2020translation,\ntitle={Translation Between Waves,  wave2wave},\nauthor={Tsuyoshi Okita and Hirotaka Hachiya and Sozo Inoue and Naonori Ueda},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxG3pVKPB}\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
