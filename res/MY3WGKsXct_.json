The ablation study shows the effectiveness of the proposed difficulty score.\n\nIssues:\n- The novelty of the proposed algorithm is limited: the reconstruction error is quite standard, and the difficulty score is not well explained.

The problem aims to detect if a data sample is used to train a neural network model. The paper observes that some images are \"universally\" easy/difficult to reconstruct, and states using reconstruction error alone is less effective at discriminating between difficult images used in training and easy images that are never seen before. The paper designs a difficulty score to augment reconstruction error based method, and shows MIA results on multiple datasets.\n\n\nThe problem of MIA is meaningful in terms of detecting leakage of privacy-sensitive data, as stated in the introduction. But the motivation of this paper is not clear. The paper lacks an explanation why studying MIA in the context of image-to-image translation.\n\nIn the second paragraph of introduction, it is not clear either why MIA can \"provide insights on the degree of overfitting in the victim mode\"?\n\nSection 3.2: What is the rationale behind the designed function Eq. (2) for measuring the difficulty of an image? The paper resizes all images into 56x56. Does this introduce noises that influences difficulty measurement? What is the resizing methods? Does different resizing methods have different performance?\n\nEq.(3): The paper considers \"difficult\" training images and \"easy\" unseen images, but does not consider \"difficult\" unseen images. For the unseen images that are difficult to reconstruction, does Eq.(3) still work?\n\nTable 3 does not seem complete. Why are there not ROC and ACC for \"ours\"? What do the numbers mean under \"ours\"?\n\nAs the paper mentioned in related work that some prior work also studies MIA in the context of generative models (GANs and VAEs), it is natural to think what the unique conclusions through the study presented in this paper?\n\nFigure 5: How to tell if \"difficult score\" is better correlated to the reconstrunction error than \"supervised difficulty\"?\n\n--------\npost-rebuttal\n--------\n\nI appreciate that authors have provided rebuttal that addresses many of my questions. I've read the updated paper and other reviewers' comments. The rebuttal has largely addressed my questions. However I am still not convinced by the following. Without a clarification I cannot see the significance of this work. So I'd maintain my rating. \n\nI still don't get the motivation why studying MIA in image-to-image translation. I really wanted to solicit a motivational example. The authors merely say \"image-to-image translation has yet to be studied in the context of MIA.\" I'm not convinced by this.\n\nA.4 The authors simply draw curves of MIA performance vs. learning epoch. I still don't know where overfitting happens. From the context, it seems that the proposed method will fail if the victim model is not trained to be overfitting.

Below are some of my concerns and suggestions:\n\n(1) The data used for training the regression model is the same with the one used for training the I2I model? Does it mean we still need to access the original data after I2I model pre-training?\n\n(2) Is the 70/30 partition of pixels for training the regression model working the best? It will be better to analyze this partition ratio and see how the MIA accuracy will be affected.\n\n(3) Generally if the pre-trained model is more generalizable (e.g., trained with more data), I feel the MIA will be less useful. An interesting direction is to explore whether it will be more useful in few-shot case, not only to detect whether overfitting happens, but also to explore how to use MIA to avoid overfitting and make the model trained with less data more robust.\n\n========\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks for the author's feedback that clarifies my concerns.

The reviewer raised several valid points, which we believe can be satisfactorily addressed.\n\n**\"The paper lacks an explanation why studying MIA in the context of image-to-image translation.\"**\nMIA attacks are studied in multiple contexts, e.g. classification models, generative models etc. The motivation is to study the potential data leakage in each such model, regardless of the specific dataset. Image-to-image translation has yet to be studied in the context of MIA. We also wanted to research the difference between this scenario to unconditional generative models, in which there is no input-output pair to compute the reconstruction error on. In such cases, the known black-box attacks are not able to achieve high success rates as our attack.\n\n**\"In the second paragraph of introduction, it is not clear either why MIA can \"provide insights on the degree of overfitting in the victim mode\"?\"**\nFigure 9, in Appendix A.4, demonstrates the effect of overfitting on the attack success rate. The more overfitted a model is, the more it is vulnerable to MIA. \n\n**\"Section 3.2: What is the rationale behind the designed function Eq. (2) for measuring the difficulty of an image?\"**\nOur method estimates the low level information extractable from the semantic features of the image. High prediction error means that the image is not easily specified using its high level attributes. This is an upper bound of the ability to specify the image from other semantic representations, such as segmentation masks, edges or landmarks. Therefore, the regression model's prediction error correlates with the difficulty of performing conditional generation task on this image.\n\n**\"The paper resizes all images into 56x56. Does this introduce noises that influences difficulty measurement? What is the resizing methods? Does different resizing methods have different performance?\"**\nThe images are resized using bicubic interpolation on all pixels that contribute to one pixel in the resized image, using the Pillow library. This was selected because the feature extractor, Wide-ResNet50x2, also resizes the images using Pillow. \nFollowing your question, we evaluated the effect of different resize methods in Figure 16. in Appendix A.13. The attack success rate is not very sensitive to the resize method.\n\n**\"Eq.(3): The paper considers \"difficult\" training images and \"easy\" unseen images, but does not consider \"difficult\" unseen images. For the unseen images that are difficult to reconstruction, does Eq.(3) still work?\"**\nYes, Eq.(3) still holds. The separation is difficult only between difficult seen and easy unseen images.\nDifficult unseen images result in high reconstruction errors, as can be seen in Figure 3, and therefore will be easy to distinguish from train images, which have significantly lower reconstruction error. The large gap from all training images remains even after the addition of the difficulty score.\n\n**\"Table 3 does not seem complete. Why are there not ROC and ACC for \"ours\"? What do the numbers mean under \"ours\"?\"**\nOur attack is based on the membership error score, and is evaluated using the  ROCAUC metric. As we do not train a classifier, we don\u2019t measure accuracy. Therefore, the numbers under \u201cours\u201d correspond to the AUCROC score. We compare our attack to the shadow model approach, which trains a classifier, so in this case we present both the classifier\u2019s accuracy and the AUCROC score of the confidence values of the classifier (but only ROCAUC is directly related to MIA). \n\n**\"As the paper mentioned in related work that some prior work also studies MIA in the context of generative models (GANs and VAEs), it is natural to think what the unique conclusions through the study presented in this paper?\"**\nThe difference between unconditional (others) and conditional (ours) generative models is the existence of input-output pairs in the black box setting. The existence of such pairs allows us to measure the reconstruction error. Unconditional generators do not have such pairs and cannot measure reconstruction. The same applies to VAE as only the generator is retained at inference time. As unconditional models do not have access to this knowledge, they attempt to approximate the reconstruction error by suggesting different alternatives to  \u201cinput-output\u201d reconstruction, e.g. measuring the distance from target image to the nearest generated image or the number of generated images whose distance to target image is within some radius. These alternative methods are not able to obtain the high success rate that our attack achieves. \n\n**\"Figure 5: How to tell if \"difficult score\" is better correlated to the reconstruction error than \"supervised difficulty\"?\"**\nWe measure the Pearson correlation between the reconstruction error and the difficulty score and present this in the \u201clegend\u201d of the plots presented in Figure 5. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper583/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper583/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Membership Attacks on Conditional Generative Models Using Image Difficulty", "authorids": ["avital.shafran@mail.huji.ac.il", "~Shmuel_Peleg1", "~Yedid_Hoshen3"], "authors": ["Avital Shafran", "Shmuel Peleg", "Yedid Hoshen"], "keywords": ["Membership Inference Attack", "Image translation"], "abstract": "Membership inference attacks (MIA) try to detect if data samples were used to train a Neural Network model.

It will be better to analyze this partition ratio and see how the MIA accuracy will be affected.\"**\nFigure 15 in Appendix A.12 demonstrates the effect of the different partitions in the regression model training. Training on less than 50% of the image pixels results in unstable performance, while using 50% or above is sufficient to achieve high success rates, with no preference to a specific value. \n\n**\"Generally if the pre-trained model is more generalizable (e.g., trained with more data), I feel the MIA will be less useful.

We experimented with training pix2pixHD on the cityscapes dataset with using the difficulty score in the generator loss term.

This is an interesting new application and a meaningful extension of the topic of MIA. It is straightforward to use reconstruction loss as a measure for membership error. However, the authors pointed out that on top of reconstruction loss, the difficulty for the sample should also be taken into account. With that the authors propose a novel method of measuring generation difficulty for each sample by training a regressor to estimate pixel value using the abstract representation by a pre-trained model. The regressor is trained using a portion of randomly selected pixels and tested on the rest. The error of the prediction is use as the indicator of difficulty. This is an intuitive method and from the results of the experiment, the proposed method seems to be quite effective. The reviewer would like the author to clarify a few points: 1) is it an assumption that the pre-trained network has never seen any data used in the testing? If not, what would happen if the data has been seen when training the \u201cfeature extractor\u201d but not the victim model? 2) Wouldn\u2019t it be more application/problem-specific to train a regressor using the data the victim model is conditioned on (e.g. the segmentation mask) to predict the pixel values of the ground-truth image in estimating sample difficulty?
