The task is to learn query representation and document representation in order to retrieve query-related documents by the maximum inner product. This is a realistic setting for large-scale retrieval problem since it enables document representations to be computed once regardless of the question, and obtaining query-sensitive document representations is very expensive.\nThen, the paper studies three different pretraining methods for this task, ICT (previously proposed by Lee et al 2019), and BFS & WLP (proposed by this paper). \nFor evaluation, the paper considers the retrieval task of question answering, based on SQuAD and Natural Questions. The combination of ICT, BFS and WLP achieves remarkable improvement over the number of baselines including BM25 and other neural-based models.\n\nThe strength of this paper is that it includes comprehensive studies on the two-tower retrieval problem. In particular, they have conducted extensive ablation studies with different train/test ratios.\n\nHowever, there are some notable weaknesses of this paper as follows.\n\nFirst, the benchmark relies on the recall rate instead of the end task (open-domain QA). Recall rate is not a good way to evaluate the retrieval result since a system may retrieve text which contains the answer text but is not semantically related to the question. (I understand that the paper follows Admad et al (2019), but I believe this is not a published paper.) In addition, this paper did not empirically demonstrate the relatedness between the recall rate and the end performance. This makes it very hard to compare with other papers in open-domain QA, which has been extensively studied for a few recent years.\n\nSecond, despite comprehensive studies, the fact that ICT+BFS+WLP is almost the same as ICT (93.91 vs. 94.37) means that the method does not give improvement over ICT which was already proposed in the previous study.\n\nThird, the gap between BM25 and ICT+BFS+WLP in Table 3 and 4 are very significant (e.g. 27 vs 94 on Natural Questions), but this doesn't seem to be consistent to Lee et al (2019). (There are some differences: (1) Lee et al (2019) compares BM25 vs. ICT, but according to this paper, ICT and ICT+BFS+WLP are similar. (2) Lee et al (2019) reports the end QA performance while this paper reports the recall rate, but one of the assumptions in this paper is that recall rate and the end performance is related.) What is the explanation for this discrepancy?\n\n(I am happy to increase the rating if my concerns are resolved during rebuttals and/or the paper includes performance on the end QA performance.)\n\nSome questions:\n1) Section 4.1 says ICT is sentence-level, BFS is paragraph-level and WLP is document-level. What does it mean? I thought, according to Section 3, all methods are paragraph-level.\n2) Section 4.1: it looks like Ahmad et al (2019)\u2019s setting is actually not entirely open-domain. Their candidate sentences/paragraphs are much less than the entire Wikipedia. Did this paper also use the same set of the candidate? In that case, it should be clearly mentioned in the paper. In addition, the data statistics are different across two papers. Did Ahmad et al (2019) include only train set whereas this submission reports train+test? In case there is an official split of train/test, why were different splits used for evaluation?\n3) Also regarding the split: for each split, how much was used for development? I believe data used for the development and test should be different. In fact, rather than experimenting on different ratios of train/test, is it possible to report on official test set, while splitting the train set into 90/10 for training and development? Or, split the entire data to 90/5/5 for training/development/test?\n\n\n\nUpdate on Nov 15: The revised paper resolves most of my concerns, so I am updating the score from 3 to 6.", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1027/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1027/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wchang2@cs.cmu.edu", "felixyu@google.com", "yinwen@google.com", "yiming@cs.cmu.edu", "sanjivk@google.com"], "title": "Pre-training Tasks for Embedding-based Large-scale Retrieval", "authors": ["Wei-Cheng Chang", "Felix X.

The retrieval performance can be understood independently of the scoring model used by measuring recall at different k. In fact, in extreme cases when the scoring model is oracle or random, the final precision metric is proportional to recall@k.\n\nWe believe recall@k is sufficient in this setup but we are also working on a new end-to-end trained retrieval+scoring setup as a followup work.\n\nWhen computing recall@k, we consider it as correct only when the system retrieves the gold evidence paragraph and sentence, not just any paragraph containing the answer text.\n\n\n\nComment2: \u201cICT+BFS+WLP is almost the same as ICT (93.91 vs. 94.37),...\u201d \n\nIndeed ICT is a very effective pre-training task as demonstrated in our experiments. But also note that, in the low-data regime of Table 5, we see a 1.5% absolute improvement of R@100 when comparing ICT+BFS+WLP to ICT. This reflects that, when there\u2019s no sufficient downstream training data, more globally pre-training tasks is beneficial as it encodes multi-hop reasoning priors such as different passages within the same article (BFS) or even going beyond different articles linked by the same entities (WLP).\n\nThe major contribution of this work is to provide a comprehensive study of different sentence-level pre-training tasks for the two-tower transformer-based retrieval models. We believe this paper provides a set of standard baselines that can be helpful for further explorations in the community.\n\n\n\nComment3: \u201cthe gap between BM25 and ICT+BFS+WLP in Table 3 and 4 are very significant (e.g. 27 vs 94 on Natural Questions), but this doesn't seem to be consistent to Lee et al (2019).\u201d\n\n(1) Lee et al (2019) evaluate on \u201cexact match\u201d metric of Open-Domain QA problems, and they did not finetune the doc-tower encoder on the QA problem. This indeed makes the comparison of their Table 5 difficult to compare with our results.\n(2) For both SQuad and NQ datasets, our BM-25 results are consistent with Ahmad et. al. 2019. See Table 6 of their paper for more details. Note that their numbers are slightly higher than ours because they evaluate passage-level retrieval, which has a smaller candidate set compared to our sentence-level retrieval (i.e. candidate c=(sent, passage)). \n\n\n\nQ1: \u201cSection 4.1 says ICT is sentence-level, BFS is paragraph-level and WLP is document-level. What does it mean?\u201d\n\nThanks for pointing this out. We agree notating ICT, BFS, WLP this way is confusing. We will change the description in the next version.\n\n\nQ2: \u201cit looks like Ahmad et al (2019)\u2019s setting is actually not entirely open-domain\u2026 Did this paper also use the same set of the candidate? ...\u201d\n\nSimilar to Ahmad et. al. (2019), this paper is not entirely open-domain. The candidate sets are converted from the question/answer/evidence tuple in SQuad and Natural Questions datasets. We will make this clear in the updated version of the paper. \n\nOur paper uses a different split from Ahmad et. al. (2019) since their benchmark does not have a train/test split. They use the benchmark to test zero-shot performance while we are interested in studying pre-training under the pre-training/fine-tuning framework. We report results on various train/test split so that we can understand the effect of pre-training when the different amounts of fine-tuning data are available.\n\n\nQ3: \u201cAlso regarding the split: for each split, how much was used for development?\u201d\n\nThe development set is created by holding out 10% of the training set for hyper-parameter tuning. We will clarify this in the final version. \n\nWe can add the suggested setting in the final version.\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1027/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1027/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wchang2@cs.cmu.edu", "felixyu@google.com", "yinwen@google.com", "yiming@cs.cmu.edu", "sanjivk@google.com"], "title": "Pre-training Tasks for Embedding-based Large-scale Retrieval", "authors": ["Wei-Cheng Chang", "Felix X.

The proposed method was shown to be a better alternative to the classic information retrieval approach such as BM-25 (token marching + TF-IDF weights). The proposed method is based on two separate transformer models which has computational benefit over one cross-attention model. For fast training, they have also used the sampled softmax. For pre-training tasks, Inverse Cloze Task (ICT), Body First Selection (BFS), Wiki LinkPrediction (WLP) were studied.\n\n\nThe paper is written well, easy to follow and well-motivated. However, there is a major technical problem in the proposed method. In the proposed approach, the query embedding (q_emb) and the document embedding (d_emb) train separately by two transformer models (two towers --- Query-tower and Doc-tower). After that, the similarity was measured through a dot product. Two embedding models are, therefore, represented by separate vector space representation. Applying dot product to find the similarity does not make much sense to me, as the embedding is not comparable in two different vector representations. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1027/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1027/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["wchang2@cs.cmu.edu", "felixyu@google.com", "yinwen@google.com", "yiming@cs.cmu.edu", "sanjivk@google.com"], "title": "Pre-training Tasks for Embedding-based Large-scale Retrieval", "authors": ["Wei-Cheng Chang", "Felix X.

This problem is often solved in two steps. The retrieval phase first reduces the solution space, returning a subset of candidate documents. The scoring phase then re-ranks the documents. Critically, the retrieval algorithm not only desires high recall but also requires to be highly efficient, returning candidates in time sublinear to the number of documents. Unlike the scoring phase witnessing significant advances recently due to the BERT-style pre-training tasks on cross-attention models, the retrieval phase remains less well studied. Most previous works rely on classic Information Retrieval (IR) methods such as BM-25 (token matching + TF-IDF weights). These models only accept sparse handcrafted features and can not be optimized for different downstream tasks of interest. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the embedding-based retrieval models. We show that the key ingredient of learning a strong embedding-based Transformer model is the set of pre-training tasks. With adequately designed paragraph-level pre-training tasks, the Transformer models can remarkably improve over the widely-used BM-25 as well as embedding models without Transformers.
