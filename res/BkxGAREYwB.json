In Rangapuram et al, the parameter update is performed by Kalman filter, which only involves a few matrix-to-matrix multiplications and is differentiable. While in this work, the parameter update is via EM iteration. The gradient of the EM iteration is difficult to compute. We provide rigorous analysis to show that the gradient of EM can be reliably approximated. \n\n\"some more numerical evidence that their approach works compared to baselines (e.g. Hinton et al 2018) is needed. \"\nIn my opinion Hinton et al 2018 is concerned with a very different problem and should not be considered as a baseline. We have compared our proposed method to various baselines in Section 5 with satisfactory results. \n\n\"since this is critical, where is this empirical evidence? this seems to be a storage problem and cannot be a complexity issue. There are ways to mitigate this problem by only storing partially information\"\n\nFirst of all, this is a storage problem as well as a complexity problem.  If we were to backprop through the EM iteration using an automatic differentiation engine, we need to explicitly represent the forward and backward probability (Equation 2 and 3) in the computation graph. This involves computing as well as storing the value of the forward and backward probability at each step in the observation sequence. \n\nA seemingly plausible way to mitigate this problem is to trade even more computation for less storage, as in Chen et al., 2016. But even that is not possible in this problem. Since we need to explicitly represent the forward and backward probability (Equation 2 and 3) in the computation graph, the \\textit{topology} of the computation graph is dependent on the $T$ value. A distinct computation graph has to be built for every distinct $T$ (Section 3, Page 4). This is particularly problematic when the HMMs in a mini-batch comes with different $T$ values, and necessitates gradient approximation methods that do not rely on backpropagation. \n\nEven if $T$ was constant for all samples, we observed that we would hit Tensorflow's 2GB GraphDef limitation with $T = 500$ and batch_size = 256. \n\n\"While HMM is arguably less prevalent in the era of deep learning\": odd way to start an intro.\"\nThat is a great suggestion. We have updated the draft. \n\nWe would like to emphasis that the contribution of this work is by no means limited to HMM related applications. The key contribution of this paper is in incorporating a well-studied classical method (EM algorithm in our case) in a neural network and enable end-to-end training by approximating its gradient. This formulation dramatically expands the choices of network layers and allows network designers to directly apply their domain knowledge in the network architecture. \n\nWhile there are existing attempts in using domain-specific classical methods in neural networks (for example, Rangapuram et al., 2018 incorporated Kalman filter for time series forecasting. Dong et al., 2018 embedded Lucas-Kanede method for unsupervised facial landmark tracking), they are limited to operations whose gradient are easy to compute. Our key technical contribution (Theorem 1) is in showing that if the gradient of an operation is incomputable, it could potentially be numerically approximated in an efficient and stable manner. It is our hope that this work would enable the community to explore incorporating domain-specific classical method in neural networks, without being limited by the differentiability. We believe this is a fundamental paradigm shift in network architectural design that transcends particular applications.\n\nReference:\nChen et al., Training Deep Nets with Sublinear Memory Cost, Arxiv 2016\nRangapuram et al., Deep state space models for time series forecasting, NIPS 2018\nDong et al., Supervision-by-Registration: An Unsupervised Approach to Improve the Precision of Facial Landmark Detectors, CVPR 2018\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1421/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1421/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Expectation-Maximization in Hidden Markov Models via Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation", "authors": ["Chong Li", "Dan Shen", "C.J.

For these reasons my assessment is a bit on the lower side. \n\n- parenthesis bug in b_j(... in Eq.4\n- in Eq. 5, index i appears both in numerator (as regular index) and denominator (as sum index)\n- what is \\Psi in Eq.8 ?\n- \"While HMM is arguably less prevalent in the era of deep learning\": odd way to start an intro. All papers cited date back to more than 2011, 2 in 2006, all the rest in 20th century. This is particularly strange given the few citations to papers >2015 in Section 5.\n- the observation sequence o_{t,1:T(u)} is \"weakly\" indexed by u (since T(u) is just a length)\n- What is the \\forall u notation below Eq. 9?\n- \"the number of nodes required to build the forward and backward\nprobability in the computation graph of an automatic differentiation engine is on the order of O(T^2). Empirically we found this leads to intractable computation cost.\" since this is critical, where is this empirical evidence? this seems to be a storage problem and cannot be a complexity issue. There are ways to mitigate this problem by only storing partially information, I feel this comparison would add a lot of value to the authors' claim.\n- Where is J^{(k)} defined (as opposed to \\hat{J}^{(k)}) defined in Eq.14?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1421/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1421/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Expectation-Maximization in Hidden Markov Models via Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation", "authors": ["Chong Li", "Dan Shen", "C.J.

They clearly formulate their message here and the technical parts of adapting work from prior literature looks solid. \n- At the same time I don\u2019t know how much the computational constraints that are formulated are really constraints in practice. A couple of the related works that are cited don\u2019t seem to have these issues. Naively O(T^2) doesn\u2019t really sound like too much of a problem unless the sequences are really long. (In their practical example that isn\u2019t applied to more general recommender systems, this doesn\u2019t really seem to be the case. So it\u2019s unclear )\n+ The technical contribution of the gradient estimation seems sound. While I didn\u2019t really go through the proof of convergence, it at least looks rigorous. But I would have to spend a lot more time here to form a well informed opinion.\n+ The experiments on synthetic data are clear and further empirically motivate the authors\u2019 work. \n\nThe paper is very well written in some parts and in other parts is difficult to understand.\n\n- I am not sure what the benefit of the \u201ce-commerce\u201d application is to the community. The dataset seems to be neither open-source, nor referenced and is insufficiently described. The comparison and conclusion with respect to e.g. GraphSage is hard to interpret as GraphSage is neither explained nor referenced properly (unless I missed it somehow). The authors repeatedly emphasize that their approach works well here but not in the \u201cmore general recommender systems scenario\u201d. It would be good if the authors showed something that the rest of the community can directly relate to instead of something that is closed-source and by definition not reproducible. \n- I suppose \u201cWe apply DENNL in a clearly defined and fast-growing sector on OUR e-Commerce platform, namely Home Decoration\u201d is technically a violation of the blind review if the authors were to now include a reference/link etc. to the dataset. On the other hand, if the dataset remains closed-source then blind review isn\u2019t violated but results aren\u2019t reproducible and hard to follow by the community with the current level of description. \n\nIf the authors can comment about the last few points above (especially about open dataset, reproducibility) then I will reconsider raising the rating.
