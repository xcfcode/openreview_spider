WRT truncated Gaussian interpretation and recent work of Su et., al (2016):\nWe have added a paragraph explaining their approach. Note that in contrast to Su et., al (2016), which uses a truncated Gaussian distribution to model the joint and conditional distributions, the analysis in our paper shows that the marginal distribution has region-wise energy function where the energy of each region is similar to that of a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, we call the marginal p(v) in (leaky) ReLU RBM a \u201cunion\u201d of truncated Gaussian distributions. We have further clarified this point in section xxx of the revision. Since this work was put on Arxiv on 11/15/2016, after ICLR submission deadline, 11/5/2016, we could not cite this paper before. \n\n2. WRT Nair & Hinton\u201910: \nThe heuristic sampling technique used in that paper samples using max(0, x+N(0, \u03c3(x)). The reviewer is correct that in expectation this is monotonic. However, the expectation f(x) = E[max(0, x+N(0, \u03c3(x))], which corresponds to the activation function of sampling routine for Nair & Hinton\u201910 does not have a simple analytic form. Therefore we do not know the energy function associated with their sampling heuristic, which in turn prevents evaluation of the likelihood in that case. However, Ravanbakhsh et al.\u201916 show that the proper Laplace approximation assuming a \u201csoftplus\u201d unit is N(log(1+exp(x)) , \u03c3(x)), which indeed has a similar functional form to the sampling heuristic of Nair & Hinton\u201910. Although in this case the energy function is available, it contains a polylogarithmic term (see table 1. In Ravanbakhsh et al.\u201916) that requires evaluation of an infinite series and therefore it is not practical. In fact, this motivated us to focus on the case of leaky ReLU RBM, which has a tractable energy function and fast exact sampling procedure from conditionals. We have further clarified this in section 2.1 of revised version.\n\n3. WRT the binary data: \nWe put the result and the discussion in the revision. See Appendix F.3.

See Appendix F.3. We study both toy datasets and two benchmarks, including MNIST and Caltech 101.\n\n2. WRT Baseline comparison (Nair & Hinton, and spike-and-slab RBM): \nBased on Ravanbakhsh et al.\u201916, the standard ReLU does not result in valid exponential family RBM and therefore even if it defines a valid distribution we do not know a close form for its joint distribution p(v,h) and marginals p(v). This also means we cannot evaluate the likelihood of standard ReLU RBM as defined in Nair & Hinton\u201910. The heuristic sampling technique used in that paper samples using max(0, x+N(0, \u03c3(x)). In expectation, this corresponds to a monotonic activation function f(x) = E[max(0, x+N(0, \u03c3(x))], which does not have a simple analytic form. Therefore we do not know the energy function associated with their sampling heuristic, which in turn prevents evaluation of the likelihood in that case. See also answer to a similar comment from reviewer 1. The other extension, such as spike-and-slab RBM, is based on Nair & Hinton\u201910. With the elementary calculation, the marginal distribution has one more integration without closed form than leaky RBM and it seems non-trivial to estimate it directly.  Therefore, the likelihood evaluation is also unknown to the community. In the original papers of both works, they all consider the classification results only. \nWe are the first work to show the baseline performance of RBM with the commonly-used (leaky) ReLU activation function and demonstrate that it could outperform Boolean hidden units.\n\n3. WRT to the novelty of this paper: \nThe analysis of this paper is based on Ravanbakhsh et., al (2016) and Yang et., al (2012). The first contribution of this paper is connecting the leaky ReLU RBM and the notion of \u201cunion\u201d of truncated Gaussian distribution (Section 3.1). We then propose the novel sampling strategy by utilizing the property of Gaussian distribution which benefits the partition function estimation (Section 4). The next contribution is we are able to give the baseline performance of RBM with the commonly-used (leaky) ReLU activation function in terms of the likelihood.We further show that the proposed sampling is better than the conventional Gibbs sampling by studying the optimization performance (Section 5). \n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Annealing Gaussian into ReLU: a New Sampling Strategy for Leaky-ReLU RBM", "abstract": "Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite graphical model that is used as the building block in energy-based deep generative models.

WRT the correctness and the computational cost: \nFor the correctness, please see Appendix E, where we discuss the connection between annealing the leakiness and energy.

The theory of general AIS has been studied by several literatures (e.g. Neal (1996)). Therefore, those theoretical guarantees without strong assumptions on the initial distributions are all applicable to sampling by annealing leakiness.  \nFor the computational concern, the inner loop is the same as standard CD except for one more flip-flops to decrease leakiness parameter in every iteration, which can be ignored compared with the projection step. The computational time of inner loop and the projection step is shown in Appendix F.2.\n\n2.

Analogous to ReLU units in feed-forward networks, these leaky relu RBMs split the input space into a combinatorial number of regions, where each region defines p(v) as a truncated Gaussian. A further contribution of the paper is in proposing a novel sampling scheme for the leaky RBM: one can run a much shorter Markov chain by initializing it from a sample of the leaky RBM with c=1 (which yields a standard multi-variate normal over the visibles) and then slowly annealing c. In low-dimension a similar scheme is shown to outperform AIS for estimating the partition function. Experiments are performed on both CIFAR-10 and SVHN.\n\nThis is an interesting paper which I believe would be of interest to the ICLR community. The theoretical contributions are strong: the authors not only introduce a proper energy formulation of ReLU RBMs, but also a novel sampling mechanism and an improvement on AIS for estimating their partition function. \n\nUnfortunately, the experimental results are somewhat limited. The PCD baseline is notably absent. Including (bernoulli visible, leaky-relu hidden) would have allowed the authors to evaluate likelihoods on standard binary RBM datasets. As it stands, performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, while improved with leaky-relu, is a far cry from more recent generative models (VAE-based, or auto-regressive models). While this comparison may be unfair, it will certainly limit the wider appeal of the paper to the community. Furthermore, there is the issue of the costly projection method which is required to guarantee that the energy-function remain bounded (covariance matrix over each region be PSD).

By gradually annealing the leakiness coefficient (corresponding to from Gaussian to non-Gaussian model), the authors can sample from their model with a higher mixing rate. With the same idea annealing leakiness, they show they can estimate the partition function of the new model more accurately. \n\n\nMain comments:\n\nThe proposed model can only account for real-valued data. However, RBM is primarily used to model binary data, real-valued RBM (Gaussian-RBM) is not a well-recognized model for real-valued data. So, to demonstrate the superiority of the model, the author should also include the comparison with binary data. And it is also not enough to only compare two datasets for a newly proposed model.\n\nThe claim that the marginal distribution of visible variables is truncated Gaussian is incorrect. For a truncated normal, the values of variables are constrained to be within some region, e.g. requiring variable v from the region a1<v<a2. But here, there is no constraint on the visible v, i.e. v \\in (-inf to +inf). The model just yields a marginal distribution which has a region-wise energy function, that is, for different regions, the energy functions are different.

We will move some of the Appendix C that elaborates on this to the main body. One standard way to deal with SDP constraint is using the SVD to do projection directly as we proved in Theorem 2. The reviewer is correct in pointing out the computational burden of SVD. We also observed that scaling the algorithm to thousands of hidden units is not practical. Therefore, as we also point out in the conclusion, a more advanced optimization algorithm, such as Hsieh et al.\u201911, is highly motivated. For example, the method of of Hsieh et al.\u201911 solves the Graphical lasso problem by avoiding the projection steps with barrier functions and  careful line search step. However, we leave computational improvements on the projection step to future work.\n\n5 WRT the figure 4: As we run algorithms to convergence,  the likelihood will improve as we show the Table 3. This portion of iterations were chosen for better visualization. We will add the result for comparing CPU time in the revision as requested.

Mix only need a few more constant time steps which can be ignored compared with sampling steps. \u201cLeaky\u201d is more time-consuming because of computing and decomposing the covariance matrix as we discussed in Sec 5. \n\n6 WRT Nair & Hinton\u201910: Based on Ravanbakhsh et al.\u201916, the standard ReLU does not result in valid exponential family RBM and therefore even if it defines a valid distribution we do not know a close form for its joint distribution p(v,h) and marginals p(v). This also means we cannot evaluate the likelihood of standard ReLU RBM as defined in Nair & Hinton\u201910.

Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood,  RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units -- called leaky RBM.  We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions.  The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.  This serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS).
