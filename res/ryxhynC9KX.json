However, as pointed out by the reviewers, the empirical results are not sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Right?\n\nYes, that is accurate.   Again, we wish to contend that our experiments are already extensive and demonstrate CNNSAT's orders of magnitude performance gains over state-of-the-art solvers.  \n\"\n\nThis is the sort of statement that I'm worried might lead to a backlash from the SAT community. I'm happy to see a much more cautious tone now (the parts about not replacing but complementing, and about how to paraphrase) and encourage the authors to implement this tone throughout the paper. \n\n\n> [Contributions]\n\n-> True, (2) is also a contribution.\n\n> [Scalability]\n\n-> thanks, these numbers look good; please include them in a future version of the paper.\n\n\n> > Finally, here is a conceptual question: if we always split instances into 10000 submatrices (100x100), and for each of these submatrices record the number of positive and negative literals, then couldn't an instance that has 1000 times more variables but the same number of literals end up with the same representation? That seems very suboptimal.\n\n> Please note that such two instances would have very different initial representations because of their drastically different sizes, C1xV1 vs.  C2xV2 (where C1, C2 the numbers of clauses, and V1, V2 the numbers of variables in the two instances): C1 = C2, but V1 << V2. Thus, CNNSAT works well with similarly sized instances.\n\n-> The very different initial representations (yet the same final representation) were indeed the point of my criticism. \nI don't understand the last comment \"Thus, CNNSAT works well with similarly sized instances.\" I don't see how that follows from the sentence before?\n\n> CNNSAT's compressed representation can indeed lead to collisions.  As we commented earlier and also shown empirically, using 100x100 submatrices balances well accuracy and scalability. \n\n-> I'm not sure whether I got across that my comment shows a conceptual failure mode: with 1000x more clauses, but each of them on average with 1000x less literals, the probability of satisfiability should dramatically increase. Yet, with the 100x100 representation this can lead to the same representation. Since this 100x100 representation, along with the use of convolutions, is the paper's main contribution I would encourage the authors to study such questions in more detail (not to improve the results, but to improve the understanding of the representation's limitations).\n\n\nOverall, I thank the authors for their response, and I believe the paper improved through the iterative review process. Nevertheless, I have remaining doubts about the use of convolutions and the 100x100 matrix representation (i.e., about the paper's main contribution). Because of this, I will keep my score at a 5. If others argue for acceptance, because this is a very interesting and relevant topic I would not stand in the way of acceptance, though (of course based on an expectation that the authors implement the changes discussed)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer1", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CNNSAT: Fast, Accurate Boolean Satisfiability using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most well-known NP-complete\nproblems and has been extensively studied.

Thus, CNNSAT works well with similarly sized instances.\n\nCNNSAT's compressed representation can indeed lead to collisions.

In terms of methods, the main innovation appears to be the use of CNNs for predicting the solubility of SAT instances, but because of the exchangeability I don't actually see the intuition for this (see details below). Overall, because of these issues, I do not think this paper is ready for publication.\n\nMisleading parts:\n=================\n\n1. Already in the abstract the authors make an utterly wrong statement about SAT solvers: \n\"State-of-the-art solvers exist and have found a wide range of applications.  However, they still do not scale well to formulas with hundreds of variables.\"\nThe same sentiment is repeated in the introduction; I'm puzzled why the authors would believe this. SAT solvers nowadays are routinely used on instances with hundreds of thousands of variables and millions of clauses (just see any of the recent SAT competitions (https://satcompetition.org/) for examples).\n\n2. Z3 is *not* a good solver for random instances, far from state-of-the-art. It is not the right baseline.\n\n3. The authors' approach implicitly makes use of PicoSAT, so their experiments are really implicitly comparing PicoSAT vs. Z3.\n\n4. Comparing the prediction time of CNNSAT with the solving time of Z3 does not make much sense to me, since it does not solve every instance.  \n\n5. No comparison of CNNSAT (internally using PicoSAT) vs. PicoSAT is given.\n\n6. The paper did *not* demonstrate that CNNSAT is competitive in practice. It is only faster than Z3 on random instances, which are not of practical interest. Demonstrating practical usefulness would require competitive performance on the SAT competition instances. By the way, CNNSAT would be disqualified in any SAT competition for falsely returning UNSAT for some satisfiable instances. Algorithm 1 should instead return UNKNOWN when it cannot find a solution.\n\n7. Taken out of context, the predictive quality the authors achieve looks great: between 96% and 99% for random 3-SAT instances. However, this is misleading since the instances are not sampled at the phase transition and may thus be very easy to classify. Usually, for uniform random 3-SAT, the phase transition happens when the number of clauses for a number of variables v exceeds c = 4.258 * v +58.26 * v^{\u22122/3} (see [1]), although I do not remember whether this is for clauses being generated with and without replacement. (I looked into the documentation of CNFGEN, and for random k-cnf, it samples clauses without replacement.) It would be very useful to see the classification accuracy of classifying every formula with >= the number of clauses c from that formula as unsatisfiable and every formula with < that many clauses as satisfiable. Could the authors please report this number during the author response period?\n\nThe authors are also missing an additional related paper: [2] used simple models to obtain better-than-chance predictions at the phase transition.\n\n\n\nExchangeability and the use of CNNs:\n====================================\nDue to the exchangeability property, we do *not* care about spatial correlation in the adjacency matrix. I am really missing the details on how to achieve the fixed-size 100x100 matrices. This approach sounds like it would lose a lot of information!\n\nI do not find the experiment studying exchangeability to be convincing. The experiment I would like to see is shuffling all variables, and/or negating half the variables, rather than swapping a single pair of variables. Even then, the experiment should optimally measure differences in individual predictions rather than differences in aggregate performance statistics.\n\n\nOne more question:\n- How was N chosen? I only saw the statement \"We choose to determine N dynamically based on the dataset.\"\n\n[1] Crawford and Auton: Experimental results on the crossover point in random 3SAT.

This may be true for CDCL solvers, but I doubt it for stochastic local search solvers.\n\n- With the authors' new focus on random SAT, the intro is based on CDCL solvers too much; the entire paragraph on CDCL becomes irrelevant for random SAT. I would think the paper should either focus on random SAT (meaning a focus on random SAT in the intro, and in the experimental benchmarks and baselines) or  on real instances (meaning a focus on real problems in the intro, and in the experimental benchmarks).\n\n- I forgot to mention this earlier, but regarding previous work that tries to use machine learning methods to improve SAT solvers, there is additional related  work on this along two lines:\n1. algorithm selection (e.g., Xu et al, SATzilla: Portfolio-based Algorithm Selection for SAT, JAIR 2008), which won several SAT competitions by choosing the best algorithm for each SAT instance based on ML, and \n2. algorithm configuration (e.g., Hutter et al, Boosting Verification by Automatic Tuning of Decision Procedures, FMCAD 2007), which uses ML to tune SAT solver parameters.\n\n\nA nitpick:\n- N is used twice, once in the dimensions of the matrix (e.g., Figure 2), and once as the number of assignments to be made by the model.\n\nAll of the above can be fixed easily.\n\n\nThe critical issue for me is whether the paper really demonstrates improvements over the state of the art in SAT solving. I am not yet convinced the authors really demonstrate that their approach outperforms modern SAT solvers (and their author response confirmed that this is supposed to be the paper's key message). \nI believe we as the deep learning community have to be very careful with any sort of statement of this kind, because if it doesn't hold up this may lead to a backlash from the formal verification community against deep learning; we should thus be extra careful with statements of this kind and only make them when we can convincingly outperform their methods in their competition setting.\n\nRelatedly, the following sentence in the abstract appears inflated:\n\"On both real and synthetic formulas, CNNSAT is highly accurate and orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art solver Z3\".\n-> apart from the fact that the sentence falsely identifies Z3 as a state-of-the-art solver for random instances (which would already cost the paper its credibility in the formal verification community), it hides the fact that the authors' approach actually makes mistakes, and that in practice no actual SAT solver would be allowed to make any mistakes.\n\nIncidentally, I also don't believe that the paper would have to demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art in SAT solving if the methods are interesting enough. Unfortunately, when trying to summarize to myself what the paper's novel methodological contribution is, I mainly could think of the use of convolutions, which I continue to find troublesome in this context. Due to exchangeability, there should be no local structure that can exploited. Also, I don't see any experiments where the authors study scalability of this approach (e.g., fraction of errors as a function of instance size). Finally, here is a conceptual question: if we always split instances into 10000 submatrices (100x100), and for each of these submatrices record the number of positive and negative literals, then couldn't an instance that has 1000 times more variables but the same number of literals end up with the same representation? That seems very suboptimal.\n\nTaking into account the authors' modifications I've increased my rating from 4 to 5, but because of the reasons above I hesitate to raise it higher.

Notably,\n> * Use the generator: https://www.satcompetition.org/2003/TOOLBOX/genAlea.c\n> * Use the solver kcnfs07 with a budget of 36,000s for labeling the instances.\n\nWe tried to regenerate formulas following the protocol of Xu et\nal. 2012. However, it takes a very long time to solve uniform 3-SAT\nproblems with large numbers of variables. For example, it takes 48\nhours with 28 solving instances to solve only 159 formulas with around\n350 variables.  To make this experiment feasible, we follow Xu et\nal.'s protocol with 300-400 variables. We used genAlea and kcnfs07 to\nconstruct a dataset with 1292 SAT and 1292 UNSAT instances. We use 75%\nfor training and 25% for testing (both training and testing have an\nSAT:UNSAT ratio 1:1).  CNNSAT's overall accuracy is 61% (97.83% for\nUNSAT, and 24.17% for SAT). There are 646 formulas used for testing,\nand CNNSAT's prediction time is 28.8 seconds.  In comparison, it takes\nCaDiCaL 8 hours to solve only 76 formulas.  We could not find Xu et\nal.'s code and experimental data for a more direct evaluation.\n\n\n--------\n\n\nIn summary, our additional experiments show that CNNSAT not only can\nclassify random 3-SAT instances, but also classify other types of SAT\n(e.g., those problems converted from SMT benchmarks or from the Agile\nbenchmarks).  CNNSAT can learn and classify SAT/UNSAT instances with\nhigh accuracy without the need to inspect patterns in specific types\nof problems.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.

Please note that there are 16000 formulas in\nthis dataset.  Even when using 10min budget (as we did and reported\nearlier), the two solvers did not perform nearly as well as MiniSAT\nand PicoSAT.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n(3) Experiment on the Agile benchmarks from the SAT competitions\n\nCaDiCaL and Riss: CaDiCaL Agile took 35h5m to solve the formulas in\nAgile 2017 with 5000s budget, 64G memory, and 10 solving instances. It\nwould take much more time to solve the formulas one by one. CaDiCal\ntook 75h to solve 913 formulas (out of the 5000 formulas in each of\nAgile 2016 and 2017).  It took the Riss solver more than 48h to solve\nthe formulas in Agile 2016 with 5 solving instances.\n\nCNNSAT trained and tested on Agile 2016:\n- Accuracy: 99.20% overall (99.7% over UNSAT instances, 98.2% over SAT instances)\n- Prediction time: 522.72 seconds\n\nCNNSAT trained on Agile 2016 and tested on Agile 2017:\n*** [Case 1] without matched formula size (i.e., training on Agile 2016 and testing on all Agile 2017)\n- Accuracy: 84.9% overall (96.8% for UNSAT, 70.0% for SAT)\n- Prediction time: 17574 seconds\n\n*** [Case 2] with matched formula size (i.e., training on Agile 2016\nand testing on those Agile 2017 formulas with no more than the maximum\nnumber of variables for Agile 2016 formulas)\n- Accuracy: 99.1% overall (99.3% for UNSAT, 98.8% for SAT)\n- Prediction time: 1236 seconds\n\nStatistics on the Agile benchmarks:\n- Agile 2016: total 5000 formulas with 2207 SAT, 2777 UNSAT, and 16 timeout\n- Agile 2017: total 5000 formulas with 2187 SAT, 2744 UNSAT, and 69 timeout\n- Overlapping formulas in Agile 2016 and 2017: We found 3095 formulas\n  in Agile 2017 are the same as in Agile 2016.  Further inspecting the\n  datasets, we found that there were 19 new formulas in Agile 2017\n  with fewer than the maximum number of variables in Agile 2016.

The authors have responded to these concerns by adding clarifications and new baselines to their paper. However, based on the discussions to date, I feel that I am not sufficiently familiar with related work on SAT solvers to say whether the other reviewers' concerns have been fully addressed. If they have been, I'd strongly lean towards accepting the paper. As for the concerns from my original review: the transferability experiments reported in the author comments below are quite informative, and I'd encourage the authors to incorporate them into the paper (or an appendix if space is an issue). I'd also encourage the author to incorporate the full comparisons against Z3, PicoSAT, MiniSAT, Glucose, Dimetheus, and CaDiCaL from Section 5.1. (I've updated my rating for the paper from 5 to 6, and my confidence score from 3 to 2.)\n\n[First Update] Based on the feedback of the other two reviewers, I believe that I was missing some important context about SAT solvers when I wrote my initial review. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both raised serious concerns about the types of SAT instances that were used to evaluate the experimental setup, as well as about the use of Z3 as a baseline for solving random SAT instances. (No author response was provided.) Given this additional information, I've lowered my score for the paper from an 8 to a 5. I do think that the approach is interesting, but have reservations about the experimental evaluation and the claims made by the current submission. (Note: As the paper authors point out in the comment below, this update was mistakenly submitted a few days before the end of the rebuttal period.)\n\n[Original Title] Interesting idea, impressive results for a first paper\n\n[Summary] The authors propose a method of using convolutional neural networks to determine whether large boolean formulas (containing hundreds of variables and thousands of clauses) are satisfiable. The resulting models are accurate (correctly distinguishing between satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas more between 90% and 99% of the time, depending on the dataset) while taking 10x - 100x less time than an off-the-shelf solver (Z3), offering slightly better quality on some problems and slightly worse quality on others. In addition to determining whether formulas are satisfiable, the authors propose and evaluate a method for finding satisfying assignments. They also evaluate their system on SMT benchmarks, where it also shows 10x-100x speed-ups, albeit with somewhat lower accuracy (e.g., 73% - 92% accuracy; I couldn't find baselines for these experiments).\n\n[Key Comments] Unless I'm missing something major, I'd prefer to accept this paper, since the problem appears novel and the experimental results seem very promising for a first paper on a new problem.\n\n[Pro 1] The paper seems polished and well-written. I generally found it well-motivated and easy to follow.\n\n[Pro 2] To the best of my knowledge, the problem domain (machine learning for satisfiability problems that are so large that they are difficult to solve using conventional methods) is both novel and well-motivated.\n\n[Pro 3] Algorithms seem conceptually straightforward (but might be a bit challenging to implement in practice due to the large input size), and yield excellent results. The magnitude of speed-ups reported in the paper (10x - 100x) is large enough to be exciting from a research perspective, and also seems like it should be large enough to have significant practical applications.\n\n[Pro 4] Results are evaluated on a variety of different boolean satisfiability and SMT problems.\n\n[Con 1] To improve reproducibility, it would be helpful if the authors could provide more details about their model training setup. Figure 2 is a good start, but adding details about the layer sizes, types of pooling layers used, and the model training setup would help clarify the experiments.\n\n[Con 2] It seems like a significant number of labeled training examples (i.e., examples that are already known to be satisfiable or unsatisfiable) are needed in order to train a neural network. This seems like it could present a bootstrapping problem for certain domains: it may be computationally expensive to generate ground-truth labels for training examples, but a significant number of labels are needed to train a good prediction model. I'd be very interested to see a study of how well trained models transfer across domains: how well do models trained on one domain (e.g., a synthetic problem where labeled training data is cheap to generate) transfer to a different domain (e.g., a real-world problem where training labels are expensive to compute)? However, this is a minor point for a first paper on a new problem, and I think the paper is interesting enough to merit acceptance without such an analysis.\n", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "CNNSAT: Fast, Accurate Boolean Satisfiability using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most well-known NP-complete\nproblems and has been extensively studied.

Right?\n\nYes, that is accurate.   Again, we wish to contend that our experiments are already extensive and demonstrate CNNSAT's orders of magnitude performance gains over state-of-the-art solvers.  \n\nTo make the case even stronger and more convincing to the reviewer, we will sincerely follow the reviewer's suggestions to conduct further experiments and summarize our results. \n\n> So, in order to prove this assertion, and to really highlight the performance of CNNSAT:\n> ... \n> * Ideally, it would be nice to use scatter plots (or similar plots) for providing as much \n> information as possible about the results.\n\nThis is a good suggestion; thank you, and we will.  \n\n> For now, in the revised version of the paper, we essentially have experimental results on two\n> datasets.

For the \"Long Range\" dataset, it could not solve only 6 formulas (out of the 16,000 formulas in the dataset) within the 10-minute budget.  Therefore, we chose this time budget because it seems to be sufficient for both datasets.  However, we are willing to solve the remaining 6 formulas using whatever resources (e.g., much larger time budgets) and redo our experiments. \n\n(2) We also compared the performance with other solvers besides MiniSAT and PicoSAT.   In particular, Section 5.1 mentions that \"We use Z3, PicoSAT, MiniSAT, Glucose, Dimetheus, and CaDiCaL for comparison to evaluate CNNSAT's efficiency. Due to space constraints, we only show the results for the two best-performing solvers.\"   Thus, the results show that \u201cFor the 3-SAT instances (in which clauses are uniformly generated without replacement) that have been solved by PicoSAT within a range of 10 minutes, and using 75% instances for training, CNNSAT outperforms all six solvers (not only MiniSAT and PicoSAT) on the remaining test instances.\u201d \n\n> Now, based on some of your comments (which are not included in the paper):\n> ... \n> For the sake of fairness, don\u2019t use PicoSAT (which is not the best solver for random instances) > for prunning out instances, and don\u2019t use a 10mn timeout.

But let\u2019s try to summarize and, please, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. \n\nThe key message of the paper is that CNNSAT is in position to outperform the state-of-the-art solvers on random 3-SAT instances. Right? \n\nSo, in order to prove this assertion, and to really highlight the performance of CNNSAT:\n* The experimental setup should be as close as possible to the setup of the SAT competitions for the track on random instances. \n* CNNSAT should be compared with the solvers which have won (or at least, which have been in good position to win) the competitions on random instances. Note that some of the winners are not CDCL solvers. \n* Ideally, it would be nice to use scatter plots (or similar plots) for providing as much information as possible about the results. \n\nFor now, in the revised version of the paper, we essentially have experimental results on two datasets. The datasets were generated from CNFGen (which is fine, I\u2019m not criticizing this generator), but : \n* All SAT problems that couldn\u2019t be solved by PicoSAT within a 10-minute budget have been discarded; \n* CNNSAT was trained on 75% of those instances, and tested on the remaining 25% instances, and\n* For the results, we only have a two-row table about CNNSAT vs MiniSAT and PicoSAT, which are two CDCL solvers.\n\nBased on this protocol, we can hardly conclude that CNNSAT is outperforming most SAT solvers on random 3-SAT instances. We just can say something like  \u201cFor the 3-SAT instances (in which clauses are uniformly generated without replacement) that have been solved by PicoSAT within a range of 10 minutes, and using 75% instances for training, CNNSAT outperforms MiniSAT and PicoSAT on the remaining test instances.\u201d\n\nNow, based on some of your comments (which are not included in the paper):\n\n> We evaluated the performance of CNNSAT on the Agile benchmarks from SAT competition \n> 2016. The results are as follows.  The benchmarks took PicoSAT more than 48 hours to solve\n> (the budget for each was 10  minutes).  CNNSAT solved all of them in 287 seconds with\n> 97.5% accuracy --- the accuracy for UNSAT is 97.6%, while the accuracy for SAT is 97.1%.\n\n\nFor the sake of fairness, don\u2019t use PicoSAT (which is not the best solver for random instances) for prunning out instances, and don\u2019t use a 10mn timeout. I would suggest to use the recent winners here : Dimetheus or YalSAT, with a standard 5000s timeout. Ideally, CNNSAT should not be trained on the SAT\u201916 benchmark instances (which are obviously \u201ctest\u201d instances); it should be trained on the instances of other SAT\u2019<16 benchmarks , or using the generator for those instances (Tomas Balyo). Finally, the results should be reported in the paper.\n\n> Below are the results when considering the phase transition over the \"Long Range\" dataset. \n> We follow Xu et al., 2012 and consider those instances with clause-to-variable (c/v) ratio \n> in [3.26, 5.26], where a ratio of 4.26 is the solubility phase transition. Out of the 16,000\n> instances in the \"Long Range\" dataset, 6,437 have c/v ratio within [3.26, 5.26].  \n> We use 4,827 for training and 1,610 for testing (803 of which are SAT instances \n> and 807 are UNSAT instances), and obtain the following results:\n \nFor analyzing the performance of CNNSAT at the phase transition, I would recommend to explicitly follow the protocol of Xu et al. 2012. Notably,\n* Use the generator : https://www.satcompetition.org/2003/TOOLBOX/genAlea.c\n* Use the solver kcnfs07 with a budget of 36,000s for labeling the instances.\nAnd, again, the results should be reported in the paper, or in the Appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CNNSAT: Fast, Accurate Boolean Satisfiability using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most well-known NP-complete\nproblems and has been extensively studied.

Notably:\n\n(i) I would suggest focusing on SAT generators or available benchmarks which have been used in SAT competitions. For example :\n\n- the generator which has been used in SAT Competitions since 2002 (this is, in particular, the generator used by Xu et. al., AAAI'12)\n\nhttps://www.satcompetition.org/2003/TOOLBOX/genAlea.c\n\n- or, preferably (for better reproducibility of the results), the random track benchmarks which have been used for SAT competitions:\n\nhttps://www.satcompetition.org/\nhttp://sat2018.forsyte.tuwien.ac.at/benchmarks/\n\nBy the way, the generator used in the last SAT competition is described here:\n\nhttps://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/237063/sc2018_proceedings.pdf?\n\n(ii) I don't understand why you \"have discarded all SAT problems that cannot be solved by PicoSAT within a 10-minute budget.\" PicoSAT is arguably not the best solver for random problems, and 10mn is too short for tackling hard instances (close to the phase transition).  \n\nSo, again, it would be more relevant to use a standard setup. For example, \n- take the random benchmarks used at the SAT'18 Competition:\n\nhttp://sat2018.forsyte.tuwien.ac.at/benchmarks/\n\n- Use only 3-sat instances\n\n- Compare CNNSAT with all standard solvers (Glucose, Dimetheus, etc.) using a timeout of 5000s (which is the standard value for several years in SAT Competitions), and a memory of 24 GB (which is again a standard parameter). Of course, CNNSAT can be trained on arbitrary random 3-SAT instances, but it should be tested on standard benchmarks, in order to highlight its performance against the state-of-the-art solvers.\n\n(iii) Finally, using the above benchmarks, it would be nice to display scatter plots for CNNSAT against other solvers. Don't hesitate to put them in the Appendix for space reasons, but they are much more informative than just a summarizing Table. Specifically, I am curious about the plot of CNNSAT vs Dimetheus (the last one is considered by the SAT community to be one of the best solvers for random instances).\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CNNSAT: Fast, Accurate Boolean Satisfiability using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most well-known NP-complete\nproblems and has been extensively studied.

We changed the sentence to \"they\nstill do not scale well to formulas with hundreds of variables for\nuniform 3-SAT problems.\"\n\nWe used MiniSAT and PicoSAT to solve the SAT instances in our dataset,\nall of which are uniform 3-SAT problems (see Figure 4 and Table 1):\nThe \"Long Range\" instances take about 11 hours for both MiniSAT and\nPicoSAT to solve, while it only takes 429 seconds for MiniSAT and 355\nseconds for PicoSAT to solve those instances in \"Separated\".\n\nThe main difference between the \"Long Range\" and \"Separated\" datasets\nis that \"Long Range\" contains more complex formulas with more than 300\nvariables. Formulas in SAT competitions are not uniform 3-SAT\nproblems.\n\n------\n\n#2, #3, #5\n\nWe evaluated CNNSAT against four SAT solvers, MiniSAT, PicoSAT,\nCaDiCaL and Dimetheus, and updated the paper with the additional\nresults.  In summary, CNNSAT outperforms all of them by at least two\norders of magnitude over the \"Long Range\" dataset.\n\nOur original submission had a typo in the sentence: \"% of Imp on\nassign\" denotes the percentage of improvement for our SAT solving\nalgorithm compared to directly solving CNFs predicted as satisfiable\nusing Z3.  Z3 should have been PicoSAT, which we have corrected in the\nupdated paper.\n\n------\n\n#6\n\nWe evaluated the performance of CNNSAT on the Agile benchmarks from\nSAT competition 2016. The results are as follows.  The benchmarks took\nPicoSAT more than 48 hours to solve (the budget for each was 10\nminutes).  CNNSAT solved all of them in 287 seconds with 97.5%\naccuracy --- the accuracy for UNSAT is 97.6%, while the accuracy for\nSAT is 97.1%.\n\n------\n\n#7\n\nBelow are the results when considering the phase transition over the\n\"Long Range\" dataset.  We follow Xu et al., 2012 and consider those\ninstances with clause-to-variable (c/v) ratio in [3.26, 5.26], where a\nratio of 4.26 is the solubility phase transition. Out of the 16,000\ninstances in the \"Long Range\" dataset, 6,437 have c/v ratio within\n[3.26, 5.26].  We use 4,827 for training and 1,610 for testing (803 of\nwhich are SAT instances and 807 are UNSAT instances), and obtain the\nfollowing results:\n\n- CNNSAT's overall prediction accuracy: 95.5% (vs. 70% for Xu et\n  al., 2012)\n\n- CNNSAT's accuracy over the 803 SAT instances: 99.4%\n\n- CNNSAT's accuracy over the 807 UNSAT instances: 91.6%\n\n------\n\nRe \"Exchangeability and the use of CNNs\"\n\nThe goal of the exchangeability evaluation is to demonstrate that\nCNNSAT is able to identify semantic equivalent formulas.  Thank you\nfor your suggestion; we have redone the experiment and updated the\npaper accordingly (see Table 2). In particular, we negated half of the\nvariables and swapped half of the variables. There is only an average\ndifference of 0.35% in prediction results from the results on the\noriginal formulas.\n\nThe fixed-size 100x100 matrices are constructed by the first layer of\nCNN. We can define the size filter and stride based on the size of\nmatrices. This compression is done by CNN.  Note that the matrix\nrepresentation for CNF is very sparse, but the number of variables and\nclauses are very large (for SAT problems converted from SMT problems,\nthe number of variables can be in the millions), which can easily lead\nto out-of-memory errors. Therefore, we compress the sparse matrices so\nthat they are denser.\n\nIn summary, we employ two types of compressions: (1) sparse matrix\ncompression from the representation of CNF formulas, and (2)\ncompression by the first layer of CNN.  The size of the compressed\nmatrix (100x100) and N are both tuned with respect to accuracy or\nmemory usage."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1022/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CNNSAT: Fast, Accurate Boolean Satisfiability using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most well-known NP-complete\nproblems and has been extensively studied.

SAT instances are represented using an efficient encoding of boolean matrices. The overall idea is to decompose an input SAT instance into simpler ones, and to train the neural model on simpler instances using an existing solver for labeling these instances. Based on satisfaction probabilities induced from simpler formulas, the architecture predicts a partial assignment which is fed to the existing solver for deriving the satisfiability result.\n\nArguably, the topic of \u201clearning to solve SAT instances\u201d is very interesting, by coupling results from neural networks and SAT solvers. This work is inspired from the landmark paper on NeuroSAT, and the experimental results look promising. \n\nHowever, since the framework is focused on solving random SAT problems (especially random 3-SAT instances), the paper is missing a detailed description of this active research topic in AI and the SAT community (see e.g. [1,2]). Notably, the problem of generating realistic random k-SAT instances has long been considered as one of the most important challenges in SAT research [3]. Importantly, modern random k-SAT instances are not only characterized by their number of variables, and their ratio  #clauses / #variables, but with an additional \u201cstructure\u201d which mimics real-world, industrial instances (see e.g. [4]). \n\nFurthermore, I had some trouble understanding how a SAT instance is solved using algorithm 1. Specifically the text in Section 3.3 that explains Algorithm 1 is a bit confusing. How do \u201cwe choose a specific number of assignments based on prediction probabilities\u201d? Unless I missed something, the output of the CNN architecture is a probability value that the input formula is SAT, so I don\u2019t really see how this can be related to prediction probabilities of assignments. This should be explained in detail since Line 15 is the main output of the algorithm, which is fed (Line 16) to an existing solver for completing the assignment. The example at the end of section 3.3 is not very helpful: namely, the CNF formula $(x_2) \\land (\\neg x_2)$ is clearly unsatisfiable, so how can the model predict that it is satisfiable with 80% probability? And, if we try here $x_2 = 1$, we immediately get $\\bot$ (the unsat CNF), but not $x_1$ (which was already assigned to $0$).\n\nFinally, the CNN architecture should be compared with modern SAT solvers which have been participating to SAT competitions. The Z3 solver is mainly focused on solving SMT instances [5], not random k-SAT instances which, by the way, is a common track in annual SAT competitions (see e.g. [6]). To this point, generic SAT solvers such as MiniSAT [7] and Glucose [8] are able to solve in few seconds some random 3-SAT instances with thousands of variables and tens of thousands of clauses (see e.g. [4]). So, the motivating assertion \u201c[...] state-of-the-art solvers do not yet scale to large, difficult formulas, such as ones with hundreds of variables and thousands of clauses\u201d in the introduction of the paper, is not totally correct. To sum up, I would recommend to compare the CNNSAT architecture with well-known SAT solvers such as MinSAT, Glucose, March, or Dimetheus [9] which has been one of the strongest solvers in recent years for tackling random instances. Also, as mentioned above, it would be interesting to incorporate some structures (such as, for example, community attachments or popularity-similarities) in SAT instances, in order to estimate whether CNNSAT could handle pseudo-industrial problems.\n\n[1] D.
