We updated the manuscript accordingly to meet some of your concerns.\n\nThe issues noted in the equations with the gradient updates (previously Eq. 2 and 4) were indeed a typo and it was our lapse not noticing it a priori. In practice, we simply update the final weights using the average of the updated weights according to the loss of each discriminator in the set. Since the above equations do not really contribute to understanding our method, we removed them from the paper, and, instead, provided a clearer explanation on how the weights are really updated at the end of each batch. Moreover, we would like to highlight that the code implementation is correct and does not reflect the incorrectness showed in the aforementioned equations.\n\nRegarding the incompleteness of the presented value function (previously Eq. 3), we reckoned it would suffice to explain textually the special case of all discriminators being dropped out from the set. Nevertheless, we inserted a final value function that addresses this case in a more formal manner.\n\nFurthermore, the architectures used for both models and datasets can be found in the \"Experiments\" Section.\n\nFinally, and adding to the feedback from the other reviewers, we also agree that using objective metrics and more datasets is necessary to further validate the presented work as originally stated in the \"Discussion and Future Work\" Section of the paper."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Introducing Adversarial Dropout in Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "We propose to extend the original generative adversarial networks (GANs) frame- work to multiple discriminators and omit, or dropout, the feedback of each dis- criminator with same probability at the end of each batch.

The treatment of the problem is excessively informal, in particular the introduction. The name is also misleading, as one would expect something called \"adversarial dropout\" to drop components/terms/etc., well, adversarially. Instead, dropout is applied to terms of the loss function independently and at random (almost! see below).\n\nLittle attempt is made to formally introduce the problem being tackled. A three page abstract has limited space to convey results, and so one would expect it to be information dense. This one spends nearly half a page on background material that would be familiar to any mildly informed reader. \n\nEquations 2 and 4 seem, under the most charitable assumption, to suggest iteratively *multiplying* parameters (elementwise, I suppose) by the gradient, with no mention of a step size/learning rate. I'm assuming this is a typo but it does not reflect well on the care taken with this submission.\n\nEquation 3 introduces a set of Bernoulli gating variables on terms of a discriminator ensemble loss. We are told these are Bernoulli random variables, except that are not, because we are told that in the event that all of them are simultaneously zero, one of them is flipped to 1 uniformly at random. This presentation is confusing and seems quite arbitrary.\n\nEquation 4 inexplicably adds a scaling term of 1/|{D_i'}| to the gradients (again, multiplying rather than subtracting, with no mention of a step size) that was not present in the loss function.\n\nZero details are given as to the architecture of the generator and discriminator in either the control or the condition. We are simply told that the baseline GAN exhibited mode collapse. Space constraints are a concern, but not overly: the presentation of the experiments done is a key part of the contribution and devoting more space to the details (or at least attaching an appendix).\n\nThe claimed improvements are based solely on qualitative evaluation against a very bad baseline (researchers successfully train GANs on MNIST quite frequently).\n\nIn summary: this work implements a trivial idea, lacks sufficient details to be reproduced, involves solely qualitative comparisons to a highly questionable baseline, contains multiple obvious errors in its equations.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Introducing Adversarial Dropout in Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "We propose to extend the original generative adversarial networks (GANs) frame- work to multiple discriminators and omit, or dropout, the feedback of each dis- criminator with same probability at the end of each batch.

Diversity is promoted between the discriminators via model level dropout and training on random sub-samples of the examples from the generator. This is a sensible line of work and the proposed approach is reasonable contribution to the space.\n\nCurrently the paper is lacking any quantitative metrics with the only results being visual comparisons of samples and identification of mode collapse. A concern is the baseline GAN model used in the paper is poor and mode collapses within a single epoch on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Studying and addressing mode collapse is an important problem in GAN research, but this paper only demonstrates that it addresses the problem in what is effectively a toy regime given the weak performance of the baseline.
