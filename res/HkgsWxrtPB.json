We have updated the draft to address some concerns, and below we answer to the questions in more detail.\n\n>>> \u201cWhy MSGI-Meta and RL^2 would overfit in the SC2LE case and are unable to adapt to new tasks. Is that a limitation of the method?\u201d\nA) The subtask graph structure (i.e., the Tech Tree) in SC2LE is fixed, as it is the inherent design of the game. For instance, Marine can only be built from Barrack and this remains fixed across the tasks. This limits the variation among the tasks, and the training and testing tasks in terms of the subtask graph structure become identical. In this case, the meta-learning method can achieve (near-) optimal performance by simply overfitting to the training tasks (i.e., memorizing the optimal sequence of options in training tasks) without any generalization over different subtask structures. Thus, this is not a limitation of our method, but a limitation of SC2LE domain in designing diverse tasks for meta-training.\n\n>>> \u201cIt seems that the authors don't use a meta-RL agent in order to get this domain (SC2LE) to work. I believe more discussion on this part is needed.\u201d\nA) \n(1) Why we did not include any meta-RL agent in the SC2LE domain: As answered to the above comment, we did not include meta-RL agents since meta-training makes the problem too trivial in SC2LE domain as we cannot generate as many different subtask graphs as necessary for meta-learning to work. \n(2) How can our MSGI model work without a meta-policy: \nThe ILP module infers the underlying subtask graph from the agent\u2019s trajectory. In principle, however, our ILP module can infer the underlying subtask graph from any trajectory data (collected by any policy), as long as its coverage is enough. Our meta-trained policy makes this data collection as efficient as possible for more accurate inference.\nAs shown in Figure 5, even the MSGI-Rand agent (i.e., our MSGI model but replacing the meta-policy with a random policy) outperform other baselines; it can still generate the experience data that can be used in ILP module.\n\n>>> \u201cAdditional results on more challenging domains\u201d\nA) As an effort to make it more convincing that (1) our MSGI model can solve complex hierarchical task and that (2) real-world tasks have a hierarchical structure in it, we conducted an additional experiment on the AI2-THOR [1] environment. Here, we defined the cooking task similar to the breakfast preparation task described in the introduction with 148 realistic subtasks such as \u201cslice bread\u201d or \u201ccook egg\u201d. We added the details of the experiment and the result in the Appendix G. The experimental results on AI2-THOR show that our MSGI model can infer the underlying subtask graph accurately, and adapt more efficiently than the compared methods.\n\n>>> \u201cThe set of subtasks is a Cartesian product of the set of primitive actions and a set of all types of interactive objects in the domain.\u201d\nA) We implemented a completion of the subtasks as a Cartesian product of the primitive actions and objects in Playground domain, but in general the completion set of a subtask can be any set of states as defined in Section 2.2. For example, the subtasks in SC2LE was defined by the design of the domain (i.e., high-level actions appearing in the environment\u2019s API). Our model does not benefit from such a specific form, and in fact our MSGI can be applied as long as the completion and eligibility of subtask can be defined. To avoid confusion, we moved the Cartesian product-based definition to Appendix C, which explains the details of Playground and Mining domain, and provided the general definition of subtask in Appendix B.\n\n>>> \u201cSuch a setup (discrete subtasks and grid-based observation) seems a bit contrived and is limited to low-dimensional state space and discrete action space, which makes me doubt its scalability to high-dimensional continuous control tasks.\u201d \nA) \nSince the policies in MSGI model operates on the option/subtask level, it can scale in terms of the number of subtasks. For both continuous and discrete state/action space cases, an MDP can be abstracted into discrete subtasks, and then our MSGI model can be applied to solve the task efficiently. In such an environment with high-dimensional observation spaces, the policy can make use of both raw, high-dimensional observations (to learn a mapping/relation between subtasks and parts of the observation) and the discrete subtask information. We also note that our experiment shows that MSGI scales well to large number of subtasks (e.g., 148 subtasks for AI2-THOR [1]) and high-dimensional observation space (e.g., SC2LE and AI2-THOR)."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2149/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2149/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Meta Reinforcement Learning with Autonomous Inference of Subtask Dependencies", "authors": ["Sungryull Sohn", "Hyunjae Woo", "Jongwook Choi", "Honglak Lee"], "authorids": ["srsohn@umich.edu", "hjwoo@umich.edu", "jwook@umich.edu", "honglak@eecs.umich.edu"], "keywords": ["Meta reinforcement learning", "subtask graph"], "TL;DR": "A novel meta-RL method that infers latent subtask structure", "abstract": "We propose and address a novel few-shot RL problem, where a task is characterized by a subtask graph which describes a set of subtasks and their dependencies that are unknown to the agent.

Because our work assumes that the option is given, the problem becomes trivial; thus, we did not include the standard tasks without hierarchy in this paper. We instead focus on the complex hierarchical tasks that existing HRL and meta-RL methods cannot solve efficiently.\n\n>>> \u201cAs for the results, the authors don't provide an ablation study on the UCB exploration bonus though they claim they would show it in the paper.\u201d\nA) We added the ablation study result in Appendix H.

Also, these two time features (i.e., remaining time-steps and episodes) need to be given to the agent for time-awareness [1] when the MDP is of finite-horizon. In our implementation, these time features were given to the policy as additional inputs.\n\n>>> 2. \u201cIt would be good to add more background/details about the previous works (e.g., [Sohn et al., 2018]) that this paper relies on (at least in the supplementary).\u201d\nA) In Appendix A, we added more details of backgrounds in [Sohn et al., 2018] that are relevant to this paper. We added an explicit reference to this in Section 2.\n\n>>> 3-1. \u201cIn the SC2 experiment, what is the difference between MSGI-meta and MSGI-GRProp?\u201d\nA) MSGI-meta uses a meta-learned policy as an adaptation policy, while MSGI-GRProp uses GRProp policy. Motivation of MSGI-GRProp: GRProp is a good approximation/heuristic algorithm that works well without meta-training as shown in [Sohn et al., 2018]. We have made this motivation more clear in Section 5.2 as follows: \u201c... Instead of MSGI-Meta, we used MSGI-GRProp. MSGI-GRProp uses the GRProp policy as an adaptation policy, since GRProp is a good approximation algorithm that works well without meta-training as shown in (Sohn et al., 2018).\u201d\n\n>>> 3-2. \u201cWhere is the \"oracle\" baseline (introduced in sec. 5) used in the experiments?\u201d\nA) GRProp+Oracle was used as the upper bound for performance normalization of all the agents. So, in Figure 4 and 5, $\\widehat{R}=1$ corresponds to the performance of GRProp+Oracle. We made it more clear in the comment of Figure 5 by adding \u201cThe performance of each method was normalized where GRProp+Oracle is the upper bound (i.e., $\\widehat{R}=1$) and Random is the lower bound (i.e., $\\widehat{R}=0$).\u201d\n\n>>> 4-1. \u201cThe limitation of assuming options to be given can be stated much earlier.\u201d\nA) In the footnote 1 (in Section 2.2) of the submission, we stated that we assume options are pre-learned. We will move this to the main text to make this more clear. \n\n>>> 4-2. Can we learn options and subtasks instead of assuming that it is given?\nWe believe this is possible but a highly non-trivial problem. One possible way is to use the option discovery methods [2, 3]. Consider the option that executes a subtask. The completion and eligibility set corresponds to the \u201ctermination condition\u201d and \u201cinitiation set\u201d in the option framework, which can be learned [4]. It is however not directly applicable to our framework since the ILP module requires the perfect (i.e., noise-free) completion and eligibility input, which is hard to achieve with the learned eligibility and completion predictor. Thus we leave it as a future work.\n\n\nMinor typos:\n\nA) Thank you for finding the typos.

Our MSGI model consists of adaptation policy, inductive logic programming (ILP) module, and test policy, and they operate in a single meta-learning framework. We used the existing CART with Gini impurity (Breiman et al., 2017) for our ILP module (see Figure 2) and the GRProp policy (Sohn et al., 2018) for test policy. Rather than in individual sub-modules, our main contribution lies in the whole MSGI framework, where we propose 1) to use a separate policy for adaptation and test phase to enable the agent to explore during adaptation and exploit during testing and 2) to use an ILP method to efficiently infer the task parameter (i.e., subtask graph) for faster adaptation. The list of contributions other than the model are summarized in the last paragraph of Section 1.\n\n>>> \u201cWhat is the big difference from the work by Sohn et al. (2018)?\u201d\nA) Sohn et al. (2018) require subtask graphs to be explicitly given to the agent to solve the task. However, our MSGI algorithm can solve the task without the requirement of subtask graph being given; instead, our method can \u201cinfer\u201d the unknown subtask graph (per task) from the agent\u2019s experience during adaptation. To make it even more clear, we clarified the difference in Section 2.2 as follows: \u201cOur problem extends the subtask graph execution problem in (Sohn et al., 2018) by removing the assumption that a subtask graph is given to the agent; thus, the agent must infer the subtask graph in order to perform the complex task.\u201d\n\n>>> \u201cThe authors evaluated one agent. It would have been better if authors trained multiple agents and showed a performance distribution (Fig 5.).\u201d\nA) In fact, we reported the performance distribution over multiple runs in Figure 5. Specifically, we reported the mean (solid line) and standard error (shaded area) of the performance over 5 random seeds, 500 tasks (i.e., subtask graphs), and 32 test episodes. We note that the standard error (shaded area) is quite small in Figure 5, since we measured the performance over the large number of runs.\n\nPresentation:\n\n>>> \u201cFigure 3 does not give a description of the subtask graph (middle) and the StarCraft II.\u201d\nA) We added more description of the subtask graph and the task of SC2 in the caption of Figure 3 as follows: \u201c...The goal is to execute subtasks in the optimal order to maximize the reward within time budget. The subtask graph describes subtasks with the corresponding rewards (e.g., transforming a chest gives 0.1 reward) and dependencies between subtasks through AND and OR nodes. For instance, the agent should first transform chest AND transform diamond before executing pick up duck.\u201d\n\n>>> \u201cSection 5.1.2 does not clearly explain the different datasets D1-D5 of Playground.\u201d\nA) We added more detail about the Playground and Mining domain including explanation about D1-D4 and Eval datasets in Appendix C. We also added a pointer to Appendix C in Section 5.1.2.

The authors make use of subtask graph inference to infer the latent subtask representation of a task through interacting with the environment using an adaptation policy and then optimize the adaptation policy based on the inferred latent subtask structure. Each task in the paper is represented as a tuple of subtask precondition and subtask reward, which are inferred via logic induction and MLE of Gaussians respectively. At meta-test time, MSGI rollouts a subtask graph execution (SGE) policy based on the graph inferred from the interactions between the environment and the adaptation policy. The authors also propose a UCB-inspired intrinsic reward to encourage exploration when optimizing the adaptation policy. Experiments are conducted on two grid-world domains as well as StarCraft II.\n\nOverall, this paper is mainly an extension of the prior work [1], which uses a subtask graph for tackling hierarchical RL problems. This work builds upon [1] by extending to meta-learning domains and studying generalization to new hierarchical tasks. While the contribution seems a bit incremental and the experimental setting is a bit unclear and limited to low-dimensional state space, the inference of task-specific subtask graphs based on past experiences and the proposal of a UCB-inspired reward shed some interesting insights on how to approach meta-hierarchical RL where long-horizon tasks and sparse rewards have been major challenges. Given some clarification on the experimental setup and additional results on more challenging domains in the author's response, I would be willing to improve my score.\n\nRegarding the experimental setup, the set of subtasks is a Cartesian product of the set of primitive actions and a set of all types of interactive objects in the domain, while the state is represented as a binary 3-dimensional tensor indicating the position of each type of objects. Such a setup seems a bit contrived and is limited to low-dimensional state space and discrete action space, which makes me doubt its scalability to high-dimensional continuous control tasks. It would be interesting to see how/if MSGI can perform in widely used meta-RL benchmarks in Mujoco. I also wonder how MSGI can be compared to newly proposed context-based meta-RL methods such as PEARL.\n\nAs for the results, the authors don't provide an ablation study on the UCB exploration bonus though they claim they would show it in the paper. Moreover, the result of GRProp+Oracle is also missing in the comparison. I also don't understand why MSGI-Meta and RL2 would overfit in the SC2LE case and are unable to adapt to new tasks. Is that a limitation of the method? The authors also introduce MSGI-GRProp in this setting, which is never discussed before, and claim that MSGI-GRProp can successfully generalize to new tasks. It seems that the authors don't use a meta-RL agent in order to get this domain to work. I believe more discussion on this part is needed.\n\n[1] Sungryull Sohn, Junhyuk Oh, and Honglak Lee.

They propose a meta-rl approach to meta-train a policy that quickly infers the subtask graph from new task data. The approach is compared to relevant baselines from both the meta-rl and hierarchical rl literature on complex domains. In particular, the authors consider a large-scale Startcraft II experiment which proves the efficiency and scalability of the proposed methodology.\n\nMajor Comments\n--------------\n\nMeta-rl is a relevant direction for reducing the sample-complexity of rl agents and scaling them to large domains. This work presents interesting and novel ideas in these settings. In particular, the few-shot rl problem with subtask dependencies seems quite interesting for both encoding and solving large hierarchical rl problems. The proposed meta-rl algorithm is sound and simple to understand. The paper is well-organized, though sometimes it is difficult to follow the formalisms due to a large number of different symbols introduced. The experiments are quite interesting and convincing. In particular, the Starcraft domain should address all concerns about the scalability and efficiency of the proposed approach. Some comments/questions follow.\n\n1. The state available to the agent includes the number of remaining time-steps and episodes. When/how are they used?\n\n2. The paper requires the reader to be quite familiar with some previous works (e.g., Section 3.2 requires to know Song et al. 2018 to understand the test phase). It would be good to add more background/details about these works (at least in the supplementary), so that the paper is more self-contained.\n\n3. In the Starcraft experiment, what is the difference between MSGI-meta and MSGI-GRProp? Furthermore, where is the \"oracle\" baseline (introduced in sec. 5) used in the experiments? I did not find any plot reporting it.\n\n4. The main limitation is that this approach requires options for each subtask to be provided before-hand. Do the authors think that the method is easily generalizable to learn such options as well? Furthermore, I realized this limitation only after reading the very last lines of the paper. Since this is of major importance, I believe it should be clearly stated much earlier.\n\nMinor Comments\n--------------\n1. First line of sec. 2.1: R_\\tau should be R_G\n2. I did not find a definition of o_t and d_t which appear, e.g., in Algorithm 1."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2149/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper2149/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Meta Reinforcement Learning with Autonomous Inference of Subtask Dependencies", "authors": ["Sungryull Sohn", "Hyunjae Woo", "Jongwook Choi", "Honglak Lee"], "authorids": ["srsohn@umich.edu", "hjwoo@umich.edu", "jwook@umich.edu", "honglak@eecs.umich.edu"], "keywords": ["Meta reinforcement learning", "subtask graph"], "TL;DR": "A novel meta-RL method that infers latent subtask structure", "abstract": "We propose and address a novel few-shot RL problem, where a task is characterized by a subtask graph which describes a set of subtasks and their dependencies that are unknown to the agent.
