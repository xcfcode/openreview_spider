It does not present a consolidated theoretical model of their behavior. We explore GNN\u2019s ability to operate across domains and scratch the surface of GNN\u2019s claim to utilize the topology of Real-world complex networks.\n\nThese experiments serve to highlight integral aspects of the impact of a network\u2019s topology and the distribution of node attributes to a model\u2019s performance. They are not comprehensive and representative all possible scenarios, but rather highlight important places where our intuitive understanding differs from experimental behavior. Scenarios which occur in the real world and where the application of these models may have unforeseen consequences. \n\nWe have improved the explanations, clarifying several procedures and providing the reasoning behind our choices. We have also augmented the appendices with extra diagrams and data where possible, and would be happy to share the datasets and other material after the paper is deanonymized. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1586/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1586/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vivek.kothari@cs.ox.ac.uk", "eu.tong@cs.ox.ac.uk", "nicholas.lane@cs.ox.ac.uk"], "title": "The Surprising Behavior Of Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Vivek Kothari", "Catherine Tong", "Nicholas Lane"], "pdf": "/pdf/d91a1e8fb64fcff2ea4b881d928c2ba8c50fd7f6.pdf", "TL;DR": "The paper presents a set of experiements which highlight the gap in our intuitive understanding of Graph Neural Networks.", "abstract": "We highlight a lack of understanding of the behaviour of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various topological contexts.

We have  further supported the results realting isolated nodes by drawing the readers attention to table 5 in the appendix - which provides a more detailed description of the results.\n- In section 6, we have redrafted with a strong emphasis on explaining our assumptions.

I found the experimental results to be interesting, especially those presented in Section 5 about decoupling attribute and topological information. However, I think the presentation may be improved and more information (e.g. about how the experiments were conducted or more plots) should be reported in the main paper or the appendix.\n\nRegarding the experiments, the authors made choices about which subsets of datasets (Table 2) or which subsets of measures (Table 1) to use. It would be nice to explain how those choices are made and if they are well-justified. Otherwise, it feels that the presented experimental results have been hand-picked.\n\nRegarding Section 3, I guess that Figure 1 presents averaged results over datasets or over models. I think it would be important to share the results per datasets or per models, as averaging may hide some key aspects.\n\nOn page 3, the third paragraph could be illustrated with some plots. Besides, the its first sentence seems to contradict the last sentence of the paragraph before Section 4. Moreover, the text in the fourth paragraph doesn't seem to fit well Fig. 2b for Amazon computers. Am I misreading this plot?\n\nRegarding Section 4, I think it would have been interesting to report the metrics about the topological features for the perturbed graphs. Are they very different from those for the orignal graphs?\n\nRegarding Section 6, the sentence \"In the previous sections, we have demonstrated that GNNs .. are robust to perturbations to it\" on page 7 seems to contradict the conclusion of Section 4.\nI found the experiments in this section to be less convincing. The edge addition technique seems to be ad-hoc and it is not clear why it would improve the performance or not. For instance, how was the value 6\u00b0*density-G chosen?\n\nOverall, although I found some of the experimental results very intriguing, I think the paper may not be ready for publication in its current state."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1586/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1586/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["vivek.kothari@cs.ox.ac.uk", "eu.tong@cs.ox.ac.uk", "nicholas.lane@cs.ox.ac.uk"], "title": "The Surprising Behavior Of Graph Neural Networks", "authors": ["Vivek Kothari", "Catherine Tong", "Nicholas Lane"], "pdf": "/pdf/d91a1e8fb64fcff2ea4b881d928c2ba8c50fd7f6.pdf", "TL;DR": "The paper presents a set of experiements which highlight the gap in our intuitive understanding of Graph Neural Networks.", "abstract": "We highlight a lack of understanding of the behaviour of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various topological contexts.
