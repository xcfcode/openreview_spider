For example, it is possible that with a very small probability $\\delta$, a dataset $\\mathcal{S}_m$ is sampled such that $f$ when overfit on that dataset does not suffer the mentioned level of adversarial error. One example of such an $\\mathcal{S}_m$ would be where all the mis-labelled points in the training dataset lie within a small $\\rho$ ball thereby only causing adversarial mis-classification for points in and around that ball. However, the result shows that with a high probability over the sampling of the dataset, any classifier $f$ ($f$ is dependent on the dataset) that overfits to that sampled dataset the adversarial error will be high.\n\nFor your second point, I believe you are referring to what has been pointed to by Reviewer 4 below. It should indeed be an inequality. We will fix it in the final version."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "How Benign is Benign Overfitting ?", "authorids": ["~Amartya_Sanyal1", "~Puneet_K._Dokania1", "~Varun_Kanade1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Amartya Sanyal", "Puneet K.

As far as I understand, the adversarial error is defined on a fixed $f$ (a fixed classifier), but taking the probability over $\\mathcal{S_m \\sim D^m}$ indicates that we are considering the classifiers trained using different $\\mathcal{S_m}$. Am I misunderstanding something?\n\nAnd I am not getting why the second equality holds, i.e. $\\mathbb{P} _{\\mathcal{S_m \\sim D^m}}[\\mathbb{P} _{{(\\textbf{x}, y)\\sim \\mathcal{D}}}[ \\exists \\textbf{z}\\in\\mathcal{B} _{2\\rho}(\\textbf{x}) \\wedge y\\neq f(\\textbf{z})]]=\\mathbb{P} _{\\mathcal{S_m \\sim D^m}}[\\mathbb{P} _{{(\\textbf{x}, y)\\sim \\mathcal{D}}}[ \\exists \\textbf{z}\\in\\mathcal{B} _{2\\rho}(\\textbf{x}) \\wedge c(\\textbf{z})\\neq f(\\textbf{z})]]$. I can understand the explanation below that says \"The second equality follows from the assumptions that each of the balls around  $s\\in\\zeta$ are pure in their labels\"; however, the previous statement only holds if the $\\textbf{x}$ is sampled from $\\mathcal{D}$ falls in the $\\mathcal{B} _{\\rho} ^p (\\textbf{s})$ ball.

This is mentioned in the same paragraph -- \u201cWe also observe this in a synthetic experiment on the full MNIST dataset where we assigned random labels to 15% of the dataset.\u201d. \n* **Regarding the result in Theorem 1**, we think, and the other reviewers have also agreed, that the phenomenon is relevant and it is important to not have to rely on intuitions but instead have proper mathematical and experimental evidence, which is what we tried to provide here.\n* **Alternate proof of using Theorem 2 using KNN** We thank the reviewer for providing an interesting alternative proof idea for Theorem 2 using K-nearest neighbour as the non-robust classifier. However, proving such a result formally would also require more careful arguments and specific relation between k and the ambient dimension. \n\n   For good generalization, the gap in sample complexity between KNN  and the linear classifier is significantly greater than the example in Theorem 2.\n\n    Secondly, having low test error for KNN will require k to be large enough (For example if  k=1, points for which mis-labelled data is the nearest neighbour will be mis-classified.) However for large k, KNN will also be a robust classifier. Thus, it seems to us that either KNN will have high test error and high adversarial error or low test error and low adversarial error whereas the example in Theorem 2 has high adversarial error but low test error.\n \n    It might be possible  to refine the idea into a proof that mirrors the statement of Theorem 2 but will possibly end up being as complicated as the proof of Theorem 2.\n\n\nWe have incorporated the rest of your minor suggestions in the draft. Thank you very much for reading the paper in detail and the suggestions.

Here, an algorithm is said to be robust if for every training example xi with label yi, one cannot find an instance x within a small distance of xi that is assigned a different label from yi by the model. This is a standard definition of robustness in the literature. \n\nThe authors claim that one primary source of the lack of adversarial robustness is label noise. They show this via a simple construction. Suppose you have a sphere of instances of radius r that have the label y (true label). Suppose then that you flip some of the labels at random. Then, obviously, any algorithm that has a perfect training accuracy will not be robust because, by construction, there exists examples within a distance of 2r from each other that have different labels. The authors make this argument formal. This result by itself is not very interesting. What would be interesting is if label noise was indeed the main source of lack of robustness in models trained on standard datasets, e.g. CIFAR10 or ImageNet. The authors show that such datasets do contain a lot of label noise but, unfortunately, state that removing such label noise by itself is not sufficient to make the trained model robust. In fact, some of their results indicate that robustness is not caused by label noise. For example, all ResNet18, DenseNet121, and VGG19 trained on CIFAR10 have a large adversarial error even with zero label noise! (Figure 2 bottom) \n\nThen, the authors discuss a different argument: they show that adversarial training prevents memorization of mislabeled examples. This is interesting. However, it would be great if the author could clarify how they determined that 994 out of the 997 samples in CIFAR10 mentioned in Section 3.2 were mislabelled. Did they manually inspect all 994 examples? This would correspond to about 2% of CIFAR10 training examples. I find this number to be quite large. For instance, the BiT model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11370.pdf) achieves more than 99% test accuracy on CIFAR10. If you look into their analysis of errors in Fig 8, it suggests that the ratio of mislabeled examples in CIFAR10 is less than 0.5%, not 2%. I would appreciate it if the authors could clarify how they determined that 994 out of 997 were mislabelled. \n\nThe second main contribution of the paper is on the relation between adversarial training and representation. The main conclusion here is that if one chooses the hypothesis space carefully, the learner can achieve good generalization and robustness. But, if the hypothesis space is not chosen well, one can achieve good generalization but poor robustness. So, the choice of the hypothesis space matters. I find this result to be disappointing. Here is a much simpler example. Suppose we have two spheres that are well-separated from each other, each sphere corresponds to a class, and we add some small label noise. Now, consider the class of linear separators, e.g. using large-margin SVM. These will not fit the training data perfectly but will have a small excess Bayes risk (since the Bayes-optimal decision boundary are disjoint spheres) and are robust. On the other hand, let the second hypothesis space be the space induced by the kNN classifier. Both the training and test error will be small (since kNN averages the labels of neighbours and the label noise is small), but the adversarial error is large (with a high probability, there will be a small region in each sphere that is predicted differently by kNN). \n\nIn summary, I think the paper has an excellent motivation with useful empirical results (e.g. Figure 2), but the main results might not be interesting since one can arrive at such conclusions using much simpler arguments as I mentioned above.\n\nAdditional Remarks:\n- The authors suggest in the Introduction section that there is no fundamental tradeoff between robustness and accuracy. Later in Section 3.2, however, they point out that robust training ignores rare examples, which reduces the test accuracy. They argue for this using the notion of \u201cself-influence\u201d. I suggest revisiting that paragraph in the introduction. \n\n- The authors add a claim in the Conclusion section that is not discussed within the main text as far as I could tell. They state that some invariances can increase adversarial vulnerability. Where is this mentioned in the main text?\n \n- There are a few typos in the paper:\n\t* Abstract: \u201cpartsub-\u201coptimal \u2014> part sub-optimal \n\t* Page 4: \u201cThus, smaller the value of\u201d \u2014> \u201cThus, the smaller the value of\u201d.\n\t* Page 6: \u201cwe found that that\u201d \u2014> \u201cwe found that\u201d\n\t* Page 7: \u201cthat are are heavily\u201d \u2014> \u201cthat are heavily\u201d", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "How Benign is Benign Overfitting ?", "authorids": ["~Amartya_Sanyal1", "~Puneet_K._Dokania1", "~Varun_Kanade1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Amartya Sanyal", "Puneet K.

More precisely, two causes of adversarial vulnerability are underlined: label noise memorization and sub-optimal representation learning. The first theorem of the paper shows that for some data generating distributions, even a small fraction of label noise leads to an adversarial prediction risk bounded away from zero for any classifier having zero training error and for any sufficiently large sample size. The second theorem shows that in the presence of label noise the choice of the overparameterized family (the representation) is very important. Namely, while for a good representation one may have \u201ctraining error = test error = adversarial error = 0\u201d, for another representation it holds that \u201ctraining error = test error = 0\u201d but \u201cadversarial error > 0.1\u201d. This theoretical results are illustrated by extensive experimental results. \n\nI find the paper very well written. In my opinion, it will be of interest for most participants of ICLR.

The paper supports this claim with a simple theoretical construction (Theorem 1) and several empirical experiments. The paper also argues that adversarial training techniques avoid memorizing noisy labeled examples and  rare examples which partly explains why adversarial training incurs higher standard 0-1 error. \n\nAnother result of this paper is Theorem 2, which exhibits an example of a learning problem and two function classes $C$ and $H$, where: (1)  there is a classifier in $C$ that interpolates the training data and furthermore achieves zero standard error and zero robust error, and (2) there is a classifier in $H$ that interpolates the training data and achieves zero standard error but has high robust error. The result would be stronger  if the quantifier in (1) is strengthened to: for any classifier in $C$ that interpolates the training data (rather than there exists). Furthermore, as the authors mention in related work, (Montasser, Hanneke, Srebro, 2019) have shown that there are function classes that are robustly learnable but only improperly. So, it is kind of already known that the representations used for learning matter for adversarial robustness. It would be good the authors could explain the difference between their contribution and what\u2019s known before. \n \nSome questions:\nIt would be interesting to see if adversarial training can be made such that to achieve zero robust loss on the training data, which means that it interpolates the training data. What would be the standard 0-1 error of such predictors?\nWould it be possible to strengthen Theorem 1 by relaxing the condition in Equation (3) such that its only required that the mass of $\\zeta$ under $D$ is at least $c_1$ (rather than requiring union of the perturbation balls to have mass at least $c_1$)? \n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "How Benign is Benign Overfitting ?", "authorids": ["~Amartya_Sanyal1", "~Puneet_K._Dokania1", "~Varun_Kanade1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Amartya Sanyal", "Puneet K.

This paper extends beyond generalization to test sets to study the network's robustness to adversarial examples.  The paper provides two theoretical contributions demonstrating that a very low training error can indicate poor robustness under reasonable conditions.  They illustrate this with experiments using label noise, demonstrating that adversarially robust networks spurn overfitting on incorrectly labelled data.  They additionally experimentally demonstrate that unusual training examples, even if correctly labelled, are unlikely to be correctly predicted by adversarially robust networks.\n\n### Significance\n\nThe generalization properties of neural networks and adversarial robustness are two very fast-moving areas of machine learning.  This paper does a nice job revealing some properties of overfit networks.  These properties are intuitive (at least, I would have assumed them), but I have not seen them so nicely laid out, and it is important to not have to assume.  It does a great job of filling in these holes with evidence, and so I find it quite significant.\n\n### Originality\n\nTo my knowledge, the work is original.\n\n### Quality\n\nThe experiments are quite well designed and performed.  I find the second theoretical contribution too quickly discussed, and the \"unusual examples\" experiment insufficiently emphasized, but otherwise it is quite a good paper.  Graphs and figures are meaningful and well explained.  Theoretical results nicely support portions of the paper that might otherwise be criticized as anecdotal.\n\n### Clarity\n\nVery clearly written.", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1136/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "How Benign is Benign Overfitting ?", "authorids": ["~Amartya_Sanyal1", "~Puneet_K._Dokania1", "~Varun_Kanade1", "~Philip_Torr1"], "authors": ["Amartya Sanyal", "Puneet K.
