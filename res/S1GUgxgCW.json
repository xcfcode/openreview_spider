However, we are disappointed about the low review scores of the paper and that our contributions were not fully appreciated. To help reviewers better evaluate our paper, we would like to re-emphasize the contributions of this work:\n\n(a) Novelty\nWe were first to be able to jointly learn the neural topic and seq2seq models. The key idea is to utilize the hard-decision trick from TopicRNN (Dieng et al., 2017) to prevent the latent variable from catastrophic mode collapsing. Previous work such as [1, 2] only incorporated pre-trained models (LDA, counting grid) into seq2seq models instead of joint learning.\n[1] Xing et al., 2017.

Steering Output Style and Topic in Neural Response Generation.\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03010.pdf\n\n(b) Better understanding/training of latent models for languages\nLatent models for languages are notoriously hard to train [3, 4]. This work contributes to better training/understanding of latent models by observing and investigating in correlations of many training metrics. For examples, we found that:\n  (i)  approximated perplexity has much more to do with the generation quality comparing to variational lower bound; \n  (ii) a lower lowerbound isn\u2019t necessarily better because the higher KL can lead to a higher sentence diversity.\n  (iii) BoW encoder works just fine in the topic component of LTCM. It is also easier to optimise.\nThese could serve as valuable rules of thumb for future model development. \n\n[3] Bowman et al., 2015.

Language as a Latent Variable: Discrete Generative Models for Sentence Compression. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07317.pdf\n\n(c) Standard and comprehensive evaluation\nWe acknowledge that evaluating chat-based systems is hard. To our best effort, we included previous metrics [5, 6] to provide a comprehensive and extensive evaluation that demonstrates the superiority of our models over strong baselines. The evaluation includes both corpus-based metrics (perplexity, lowerbound, KL divergence, uniqueness, Zipf coefficients) and human judgments (interestingness, appropriateness, as well as a pairwise comparison).\n\n[5] Serban et al., 2016.
