Without proper chemical names, all the rest CIP cannot be effectively done further. We already have mass data about chemistry including research papers and patents, from which we already have extracted a lot of chemical information databases. However, all the extraction is limited by the unsatisfactory accuracy on chemical names. So far, incomplete statistics show that the largest database maybe only contains 2% chemical names appearing in the literature, and the rest 98% that are supposed to be extracted cannot be exploited by CIP techniques just due to the name problem. The bottleneck of CIP is just located at its pipeline entrance, which is right what we do for in this work.\n\nWe'd like to re-paraphrase our contribution as formulization or solution novelty from the non-trivality of our concerned task. As we know, our original aim in the task is to restore molecule structure just from a linear symbol sequence, chemical names which maybe have diverse spelling errors. It is surely uneasy from such a form by considering we have to let computer convert erring linear sequence into standard/exact 3D structure. Even though we re-formulize the most challenging part of the task into a chemical name correction subtask, it is still hard to solve. As no blanks are between chemical name stems and all the parts can be swap positions freely in different literature. We tried straightforward spell correction methods in NLP as the task looks like such a type, however, all methods including classical language model were shown to be a failure, for example, the most effectivel edit distance correction can only solve less than 2% cases. Machine translation solution come to us very late, whose effectiveness has been shown in this paper you are reading now.\n\nOverall, we contribute a novel ML solution for a bottleneck problem in CIP in this paper. Our components are not new maybe, but our solution especially for the task and our attempt that introduce these ML methods are new for sure.\n\nAs we do not have enough space in the paper, we choose to submit the above comments here."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper15/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper15/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper15/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CHEMICAL NAMES STANDARDIZATION USING NEURAL SEQUENCE TO SEQUENCE MODEL", "abstract": "Chemical information extraction is to convert chemical knowledge in text into true chemical database, which is a text processing task heavily relying on chemical compound name identification and standardization.

It's not my area, but I was frankly surprised when the paper said there was only one relevant prior piece of work, but having searched for a few minutes on Google Scholar, I'm at least inclined to believe that the authors are (approximately) right on that one. (This stands in stark contradistinction to the large quantity of biomedical entity recognition and linking work.) So, it's valuable to have work in this area, and the approach and application are sensible. In one sense, this gives the work significance and originality (as to domain). The paper is also clearly written, and certainly sufficiently accessible to an ML reader.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, though, I just don't think this qualifies for acceptance at ICLR. It's application of known techniques, and lacks any ML novelty or sufficient ML interest. It would only be appropriate for an \"ML applications\" track, which ICLR does not have. And while its performance is _way_ better than that of the only previous work on the topic that they know, accuracy of mapping non-systematic chemical terms (54.04%) is still low enough that this technique doesn't seem ready for prime time. \n\nOther comments: In table 5, you show that a prior pipeline stage of spelling correction is definitely useful in your system (table 5). And yet, given the power of deep learning seq2seq transductions, and the potential to use them for spelling correction, one might wonder whether this prior step of spelling correction is really necessary. It might be interesting to explore further where it helps and whether the gains of spelling correction might be obtainable in other ways such as using data augmentation (such as spelling error insertion) in the seq2seq training data. The Golebiewski bib entry is lacking any information as to where it is published, which seems especially bad for the key citation to prior work of the whole paper.

The model achieves significantly improved results on the proposed corpus, even though compared to a underwhelming baseline. The analysis could be improved by showing and explaining some examples of failed translation attempts. It would also be interesting to see how the failed attempts are distributed over the error types (spelling, order, common name, synonym). The authors suggest a scenario where non-systematic names are converted and checked against a database of systematic names. For this, it would be interesting to know whether there are cases where a non-systematic name was translated into the wrong (but valid) systematic name.\n\nConcluding, the paper presents an interesting application for machine translation, a new dataset and a method that successfully labels 50% of the given corpus.\n\nMinor issue: The color scale of Fig. 5 is hard to recognize due to low contrast.", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper15/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "CHEMICAL NAMES STANDARDIZATION USING NEURAL SEQUENCE TO SEQUENCE MODEL", "abstract": "Chemical information extraction is to convert chemical knowledge in text into true chemical database, which is a text processing task heavily relying on chemical compound name identification and standardization.
