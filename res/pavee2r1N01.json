Even though geometric approaches to adversarial robustness are appealing there are too many issues left open (see below for detailed comments) so that the paper is not above the bar for ICLR.\n\nDetailed comments:\n - incremental resp. small theoretical contribution: the bounds in Theorem 1 are worse than what has been derived in Croce et al (2019), which is admitted only in the Experiments section but this should directly be discussed after Theorem 1, or are based on other's work Moosavi-Dezfooli et al(2019)\n - the proofs are still not very clear even after the update e.g. it is not clear to me what is meant with the distance to the decision boundary d_D(x) as this quantity cannot be computed (this is the whole point here)\n - the experimental results are in most of the cases worse than prior work (KW and MMR). The authors argue that their results hold for both threat models but then the l_infty/l_2 robustness of the other models should have been provided to make the point.\nMoreover, if multiple norm ball threat models is the point, then the authors should compare to the follow up work of Croce et al at ICLR 2020 which explicitly optimizes all l_p-balls. \n- the point with gradient obfuscation of MMR does not make sense to me as the gap between upper and lower bounds on the robust error is quite small for MMR in most cases. Gradient obfuscation would mean that the PGD attack fails and thus the lower bound would have to be close to zero. \n- Figure 1c) looks like the Figure from the book of Boyd and Vandenberghe - if this is the case then it has to be correctly referenced in the caption\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Provable Robustness by Geometric Regularization of ReLU Networks", "authorids": ["~Chester_Holtz1", "~Changhao_Shi1", "~Gal_Mishne1"], "authors": ["Chester Holtz", "Changhao Shi", "Gal Mishne"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "adversarial attack", "robust certification"], "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to small, adversarial perturbations of their input.

To address the issues mentioned:\n\n1. Novelty: We agree that this work is a follow-up to Croce et al., however, we argue that our empirical results demonstrate significant advantages of our algorithm - namely fewer hyperparameters (i.e. by taking into account the geometry of the polytope, we avoid having to tune heuristic parameters, such as K in the MMR formulation), robustness to gradient obfuscation, adaptation to the local polytope geometry of samples, and efficiency of optimization. We have included a section (4.2) highlighting an additional advantage of using the LDR component of our regularizer - namely, robustness to gradient obfuscation. We show that MMR-based regularizers appear to suffer from this issue while GR does not. \n\n2. Experimental results: We agree with the reviewer. We have added additional experiments to the main text (Table 2) comparing our work to recent, state-of-the art first and second-order regularization-based algorithms (TRADES, LLR, TULIP, CURE). In summary, our method demonstrates competitive performance with the provable approaches (matching or exceeding performance with respect to robust accuracy), although the heuristic methods remain state-of-the-art.\n\n3. Computational considerations: Computing both the regularizer and certificate requires negligible overhead compared to related methods. Note that given $x$, a forward pass through $f$ is sufficient to compute both the linearization of $f$ around $x$ and the associated region (the polytope). Given these entries, optimizing the regularization term corresponds to solving a smooth, unconstrained convex optimization problem - which can be done very efficiently using gradient descent. Computing the Dikin certificate involves computing the polytope and performing an eigenvalue decomposition on the Hessian (a symmetric, PSD matrix) of the Log-barrier function (note, this is just to compute the certificate - we don\u2019t do this during training). Alternatively, recent state-of-the-art regularization methods (CURE, LLR, TULIP, TRADES) typically necessitate sampling, and/or computing gradients (to recover adversarial perturbations) on individual samples/batches - this incurs a significant overhead during training. \n\nWe also thank the reviewer for catching issues with the citation of Croce et. al.. We have fixed this in the most recent version. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2735/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2735/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Provable Robustness by Geometric Regularization of ReLU Networks", "authorids": ["~Chester_Holtz1", "~Changhao_Shi1", "~Gal_Mishne1"], "authors": ["Chester Holtz", "Changhao Shi", "Gal Mishne"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "adversarial attack", "robust certification"], "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to small, adversarial perturbations of their input.

The other models compared to are tuned per-perturbation.

Regarding blocked out grey results for CIFAR 10 under the FC1 heading, we do not report these results as fully connected networks perform very poorly in general on CIFAR 10.

To address the issue brought up, we have rewritten the derivations of Theorem 1 and its associated Lemma in the appendix. We have also clarified and rewritten several elements of the theorem in the paper and its discussion. We have composed a preliminaries section in the appendix and have provided the curvature bounds presented in Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. For completeness, we also have included a proof of a fact stated in the paper - that the Dikin Ellipse is contained within its associated polytope. We hope that these additional clarifications and details help clear up any ambiguities.\n\nTo add additional context, the existing work on defences to adversarial attacks fall into two categories: (1) heuristic methods (e.g. adversarial training) (2) techniques that optimize a provable bound on the \u201crobust radius\u201d given an input (e.g. the method proposed in our work). We introduce such a (novel) bound on the robust radius given an input in section 3.4 (the Dikin Certificate) and propose a simple, geometrically motivated regularization term (ACR), which when optimized, improves the bound. Theorem 1 and its proof serve as formal statements of (1) the bound and (2) the fact that our regularizer maximizes this bound under weak assumptions on the polytope geometry. We also provide experiments to show the regularization works in practice - and works generally to induce models that are simultaneously robust to multiple perturbations (namely, l-2 and l-inf perturbations). We have added additional clarification in the new draft.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2735/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2735/Authors"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Provable Robustness by Geometric Regularization of ReLU Networks", "authorids": ["~Chester_Holtz1", "~Changhao_Shi1", "~Gal_Mishne1"], "authors": ["Chester Holtz", "Changhao Shi", "Gal Mishne"], "keywords": ["deep learning", "adversarial attack", "robust certification"], "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to small, adversarial perturbations of their input.

It can be viewed as a alternative to the regularizer proposed in Croce et al. (2018) -- the current regularizer uses the analytic center, whereas the previous work (named MMR) guarantees that are straightforward consequences of the geometric interpretation. The experimental setup is similar to the one in Croce et al. (2018), which compares the result of different adversarial defense methods on MNIST, F-MNIST, and CIFAR10 on small shallow networks. These computational results generally slightly outperform MMR on MNIST.\n\nThe paper is polished and well-written, and the use of the analytic center is reasonably motivated via the geometry of the neural network.\n\nHowever, the paper has a few major drawbacks that need to be addressed before acceptance.\n\n(1) Novelty: The paper can be seen as a twist on Croce et al., working off some of the same intuition and using very similar experiments. The theoretical results are a simple consequence of using the analytic center. Hence, this work can be viewed as incremental.\n\n(2) Experimental Results: Given that the set of regularization approaches has significantly grown since the prior paper was published, the authors should at least compare their methods with some of these. This is especially important given that the results are not much better than MMR (and worse in some cases).\n\n(3) Computational Considerations: The computation effort needed to incorporate this regularizer should be discussed explicitly so the reader can understand the trade-offs between incorporating this regularizer vs. other defense methods.\n\nSide note:\nThe authors should update the citation for Croce et al. to refer to the conference version of the paper.
