In particular, when transferring to the less similar language Chinese, the model with MAN removed performs significantly worse, indicating language-invariant features are important for this case. On the other hand, when transferring to German or Spanish, where the target language is more similar to a subset of source languages, we observe that the model with MoE removed performs much worse, illustrating the importance of private features in such cases. The fact that MAN-MoE outperforms both MAN-only and MoE-only in both cases show that our model is able to learn what's important for sharing in every scenario.\n\n- We added the visualization of gate outputs to the paper in the latest update. One complication is that the expert gate makes decision at the token level instead of at the sentence level. That means the weights vary from token to token even in the same input sentence. It is hence harder to visualize. We did some aggregation to see if there were any insights on the language or sentence level.\n\nFor clarification:\nThe CharCNN produces a character-level word embedding for each word, and is concatenated to the pretrained word embeddings. The CharCNN is randomly initialized and is updated end to end together with the rest of the model, and is not separately trained. Therefore, it is trained on the target language during the MAN training, since the adversarial training part uses monolingual data from all languages including the target language.\nWe clarified this in the paper."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper440/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper440/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper440/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-Resource Multilingual Model Transfer: Learning What to Share", "abstract": "Modern natural language processing and understanding applications have enjoyed a great boost utilizing neural networks models.

In contrast, our MoE model dynamically decide what to share on a token-level for any given input sample, where the model is able to dynamically use distinct expert mixtures for two samples from the same language.\nIn addition, their method focuses on the multi-task learning setting, while ours deals with the multi-source transfer learning case.\nFinally, the shared features in our model is learned by language-adversarial training, which is absent in Sluice Network.\n\nWe agree that it is not necessary to emphasize our method being the first zero-resource CLTL method, and we removed the claim in the latest update.\n\nWe added the visualization of gate outputs to the paper in the latest update. One complication is that the expert gate makes decision at the token level instead of at the sentence level. That means the weights vary from token to token even in the same input sentence.

The approach seems to be a rather direct application of a subset of the sluice network architecture in [0]\u00a0- which has been available on ArXiV since 2017 - with MUSE pre-trained embeddings. In particular, I don\u2019t think the claim that the authors \u201cpropose the first zero-resource multilingual transfer learning model\u201d is necessary - and I think it is way too strong a claim. Training an LSTM on English data with MUSE/vecmap embeddings is pretty standard by now, and this does not require any target language training data or cross-lingual supervision either. See zero-shot scenarios in [1-2], for example.\n\nApart from that, I think the write-up is nice, the approach makes a lot of sense, and results are impressive. I would have liked to see a bit more analysis. In particular, the fact that you learn gate values, makes it easy to analyze/visualize what and how your networks learn to share. \n\nI think there\u2019s a few baselines in between BWE and MAN, e.g., simple adversarial training and adversarial training with GradNorm [3], that would put your results in perspective. Finally, I would like to encourage the authors to run experiments with actual low-resource languages: A literature on cross-lingual transfer experimenting with German, Spanish, and Japanese, could end up being very heavily biased.

This is a well written paper that makes a number of contributions:\n\n1. It provides an interesting discussion of transfer form multiple source languages into a target language. This is a timely problem and the paper points out that adversarial networks may be too limiting in this setup.\n\n2. It provides a modeling approach that deals with the limitations of adversarial networks as mentioned in (1).\n\n3. It demonstrates the value of the proposed approach through an extensive experimental setup.\n\nAt the same time, I see two major limitations to the paper:\n\n1. While the proposed approach is valid, it is not very original, at least in my subjective eyes. The authors integrate a classifier that combines the private, language-specific features so that not only features that are shared between all the involved languages can be used in the classification process. While this is a reasonable idea that works well in practice, IMO it is quite straight forward and builds on ideas that have been recently been proposed in many other works.\n\n2. The authors claim that: \"To our best knowledge, this work is the first to propose\nan unsupervised CLTL framework without depending on any cross-lingual resource\"\n\nThis is, unfortunately, not true. I refer the authors to the paper:\n\nDeep Pivot-Based Modeling for Cross-language Cross-domain Transfer with Minimal Guidance. Yftah Ziser and Roi Reichart. EMNLP 2018.\n\nIn their lazy setup, the EMNLP authors do exactly that. They address the more complicated cross-language, cross-domain setup, but their model can be easily employed within a single domain. Their experiments even use the multilingual sentiment dataset used in the current paper. The model in the EMNLP paper shows to outperform adversarial networks, so it can be competitive here as well.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper440/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Zero-Resource Multilingual Model Transfer: Learning What to Share", "abstract": "Modern natural language processing and understanding applications have enjoyed a great boost utilizing neural networks models.
