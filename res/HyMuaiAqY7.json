Specifically, the work proposes to use the Fisher Integral Probability Metric as the divergence measure in our GAN model, instead of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. It shows little results (seems to be positive) using this new distance measure other than traditional ones.  Except that, I didn't see any other contribution from this paper.\n\n- Suggestions\nThe paper is poorly written and seems to be a rush submission to ICLR. For example:\n* a lot of grammatical errors throughout the paper\n* only 6.5 papes out of 8 pages are utilized\n* the introduction is not convincing -- what problem are you going to address? any summary of your methodology? why it is expected to outperform existing frameworks? what distinguishes your work from existing works? and what're your main results? I cannot conclude after reading the intro.\n* the results are very minor and not convincing. It seems the authors conducted a very limited set of experiments and concluded that the proposed Deli-Fisher GAN is better. If you claim that the proposed framework can generate better images, at least the framework should be compared to the latest state-of-the-art GANs (e.g. spectral GANs, etc.)\n* The writing is not polished. \n\nOverall, the paper is far from ready to be submitted to ICLR, not mentioning acceptance. I would recommend the authors to conduct more experiments and comparisons and do a better job before submitting it to future conferences.\n\n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper819/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Deli-Fisher GAN: Stable and Efficient Image Generation With Structured Latent Generative Space", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful tools for realistic image generation.

The structure of the latent space we consider in this paper is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians, whose parameters are learned in the training process. Furthermore, to improve stability and efficiency, we use the Fisher Integral Probability Metric as the divergence measure in our GAN model, instead of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We show by experiments that the Deli-Fisher GAN performs better than DCGAN, WGAN, and the Fisher GAN as measured by inception score.", "keywords": ["Generative Adversarial Networks", "Structured Latent Space", "Stable Training"], "authorids": ["bfang@iu.edu", "jiac@iu.edu", "miajiang@iu.edu", "dhchat@iu.edu"], "authors": ["Boli Fang", "Chuck Jia", "Miao Jiang", "Dhawal Chaturvedi"], "TL;DR": "This paper proposes a new Generative Adversarial Network that is more stable, more efficient, and produces better images than those of status-quo ", "pdf": "/pdf/adabb9c4f4e6fb02b90e8fcbf3763efaa8a34b6d.pdf", "paperhash": "fang|delifisher_gan_stable_and_efficient_image_generation_with_structured_latent_generative_space", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nfang2019delifisher,\ntitle={Deli-Fisher {GAN}: Stable and Efficient Image Generation With Structured Latent Generative Space},\nauthor={Boli Fang and Chuck Jia and Miao Jiang and Dhawal Chaturvedi},\nyear={2019},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyMuaiAqY7},\n}"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"id": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Paper819/Official_Review", "cdate": 1542234369692, "expdate": 1552335264000, "duedate": 1541196000000, "reply": {"forum": "HyMuaiAqY7", "replyto": "HyMuaiAqY7", "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the reply content.", "values": ["everyone"]}, "nonreaders": {"values": []}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values-regex": "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper819/AnonReviewer[0-9]+"}, "writers": {"description": "Users that may modify this record.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}, "content": {"title": {"order": 1, "value-regex": ".{0,500}", "description": "Brief summary of your review.", "required": true}, "review": {"order": 2, "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,200000}", "description": "Please provide an evaluation of the quality, clarity, originality and significance of this work, including a list of its pros and cons (max 200000 characters).", "required": true}, "rating": {"order": 3, "value-dropdown": ["10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper", "9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept", "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "7: Good paper, accept", "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "3: Clear rejection", "2: Strong rejection", "1: Trivial or wrong"], "required": true}, "confidence": {"order": 4, "value-radio": ["5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature", "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct", "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct", "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper", "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"], "required": true}}}, "multiReply": false, "tcdate": 1552335809614, "tmdate": 1552335809614, "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper819/Reviewers"], "noninvitees": [], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"]}}}], "count": 6}
