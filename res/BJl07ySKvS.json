Yet, this submission uses a different dataset that has not been explored before, which makes it harder to compare with other methods.

The revision addresses my comments on  (1) evaluating the performance of different neural oracle models, (2) presenting intermediate results, and (3) missing related works.\n\n I have a mixed feeling about accepting this paper. I like the intuitive idea of iteratively alternating between producing programs with an existing program synthesizer and augmenting examples to disambiguate possible programs with a neural oracle that learns to select correct outputs.

The core idea is to generate several candidate solutions, execute them on several inputs, and then use a learned component to judge which of the resulting input/output pairs are most likely to be correct. This avoids having to judge the correctness of the generated programs and instead focuses on the easier task of judging the correctness of outputs. An implementation of the idea in a tool for synthesizing programs generating UIs is evaluated, showing impressive improvements over the baseline.\n\n= Strong/Weak Points\n+ The idea is surprisingly simple and applies to an important problem in program synthesis.\n+ The experiments show that the method works very well in UI-generation domain\n- The paper repeatedly claims general applicability to program synthesizers, but is only evaluated in the specific domain of UI-generating programs. I have substantial doubts that the approach would work as well in the domains of, e.g., string manipulation, Karel, or data structure transformations. My doubts are based on the fact that there are easily generalizable rules for UIs (no overlaps, symmetry, ...), whereas other domains are less easily described. This creates a substantial gap between paper claims and empirical results.\n- The writting is somewhat sloppy (see below), which makes it sometimes hard to understand. Names such as \"views\" are used without explanation, and it's not explained how a device is an input to a program (yes, I get what this means, but it makes in unnecessarily hard to follow the paper)\n\n= Recommendation\nI would ask the authors to rewrite their paper to make less general claims, but believe that the general idea of judging the correctness of a program (or policy) by evaluating it on different inputs is a powerful concept that would be of substantial value to the wider ICLR audience. Improving the readability of the paper would make me improve my rating to a full accept.\n\n= Minor Comments\n* page 1, par \"Generalization challenge\": The second sentence here is 4 lines long and very hard to follow.

Please find the answers to your questions below:\n\n*reproducibility*\nGiven the clear description in the main paper and the details provided in the appendix, I believe reproducing the results is possible if the dataset is available. \n\nA: We are happy to hear that. We are in the process of releasing the code, datasets and trained models. \n\nQ: Could you provide a more comprehensive description of the dataset? \n\nA: The datasets $\\mathcal{D}_{U}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{S}$ are obtained by using the screenshot and UI metadata collected as part of the RICO dataset. A thorough description of the dataset including the examples is available at http://interactionmining.org/rico. For the $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$ we downloaded the same set of applications used in the RICO dataset and rendered them on three different devices. We will include all the datasets and their description as part of our code release.\n\n*experiment setup*\nQ: The experiments are not sufficient. While the claims look promising, the proposed method is only evaluated in only one dataset, which is not sufficiently convincing. \n\nA: We believe focusing on a single real-world type of data which is important in practice (UIs) is already a challenging task, and similarly to other real-world synthesizers (e.g., FlashFill), we did not experiment with a different domains. As mentioned, we are happy to update the write-up to explicitly say the focus is on one type of domain. We do note that considering a real-world dataset is already in contrast to most other existing datasets used in program synthesis that are either very small/toy or contain only synthetic examples.\n\nQ: I suggest the authors to also experiment the FlashFillTest dataset where string transformation programs are synthesized. \n\nA: Unfortunately, to our best knowledge this dataset is not publicly available as discussed here (https://openreview.net/forum?id=Skp1ESxRZ).\n\n*experiment results*\nQ: Would it be possible to randomly sample some synthesized programs (both success and failure) and present them in the paper. \n\nA: Yes, we are working on a revision of our paper that will include such examples.\n\nQ: Would it be possible to present some examples of the given I/O pairs, initially synthesized programs ($p_1$), found distinguishing input ($x^*$), candidate outputs ($y$), the prediction of the neural oracle (i.e. selected outputs), the augmented examples ($\\mathcal{I} \\cup {(x^*, y^*)}$), and finally the next synthesized program. \n\nA: Yes, we are working on a revision of our paper that will include such examples.\n\n*ablation study*\nQ: Only the final performance (i.e. the program synthesis performance) is shown in the paper. I believe it would be helpful if the performance of the neural oracle was also presented. One way to show this is to simply show the performance of all the neural oracles (with different architectures) trained on $\\mathcal{D}_{S}$  (the positive samples and the incorrect samples) or even $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$ .\n\nA: We are happy to include these results in the appendix. Below we provide the summary of the neural oracle results when evaluated on the $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$ dataset: \n\nTrained on $\\mathcal{D}_{S}$: MLP: 44.5%, RNN: 51.2%, CNN: 36.6%, RNN+CNN: 58.7%\nTrained on $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$: MLP: 54.6%, RNN: 87.5%, CNN 51.2%, RNN+CNN: 89.9%. \n\nIn general, the neural-oracle results correlate with the results of the end-to-end synthesis. One exception is the MLP model trained on $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$  dataset which performs worse on the end-to-end synthesis experiment even though the oracle performs better. A reason for this is that the MLP often makes mistakes when predicting the early views which then affects predictions for subsequent views. For the same reason, accuracies of the oracle experiment are in general higher than the accuracy we observe in the synthesis experiment. \n\nWe will provide these additional results and the discussion in the updated version of our paper.\n\n*related work*\nQ: Some neural program synthesis works explore a variety of mechanisms to encode examples and fuse their features, which are not mentioned in the paper [Devlin et al. in ICML 2017, Sun et al. in ICML 2018].

In our related work we tried to focus on the high level approaches used by prior works to resolve ambiguities in the input specification rather than the details of the neural architectures they use.

For other domains, it may be more important to evaluate the candidate program together with its output, which would make it similar to a re-ranking approach.\n\nA: We agree, there are domains (like the one considered in our work) where the output is much more important and has much more structure than the program used to generate it. Similarly, there are other domains where the opposite is true. We note that it would be interesting to try our approach even in the latter case where the additionally generated input-output example could be used to refine the model confidence (or as a sanity check, especially if complex neural models are used)\n\nQ: How big was $\\mathcal{I}_i$ in the supervised dataset? Was it always 3?\n\nA: For all our synthesis experiments, the input specification always contained only a single example (containing a single device and its associated views). This is because this corresponds to how the tool would typically be used by a developer. The fact that the input specification in the dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$ contains multiple samples (indeed, it contains 3 samples per application for the different devices) was used only during oracle training.\n\nQ: I wasn't able to find any evaluation of a model trained on $\\mathcal{D}_{U}$, did I miss it in the paper?\n\nA: We omitted such evaluation in the paper as in our domain the dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{S}$ is created synthetically from $\\mathcal{D}_{U}$ (by automatically generating negative samples) and results in models that are strictly better than those trained only on $\\mathcal{D}_{U}$. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1636/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1636/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Guiding Program Synthesis by Learning to Generate Examples", "authors": ["Larissa Laich", "Pavol Bielik", "Martin Vechev"], "authorids": ["llaich@ethz.ch", "pavol.bielik@inf.ethz.ch", "martin.vechev@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["program synthesis", "programming by examples"], "abstract": "A key challenge of existing program synthesizers is ensuring that the synthesized program generalizes well.

Since our datasets consist of three different screen sizes the choice is small. However, we could generate more than three dimensions for the training dataset and use them to train additional models.

To this end, the paper proposes a framework that iteratively alternates between producing programs with an existing program synthesizer and augmenting examples to disambiguate possible programs with a neural oracle that learns to select correct outputs. Several architectures and the design of input of the neural oracle have been investigated. The experiments on Andriod layout program synthesis with an InferUI synthesizer show that the proposed framework can improve the generalization of synthesized programs. However, I find it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness without sufficient qualitative results and the intermediate outputs (e.g. a distinguishing input and candidate outputs) of the proposed framework (see details below).\n\nSignificance: are the results significant? 4/5\nNovelty: are the problems or approaches novel? 4/5\nEvaluation: are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? 3/5\nClarity: is the paper well-organized and clearly written? 4/5\n\n[Strengths]\n\n*motivation*\n- The motivation for improving the generalization of program synthesis by augmenting examples is convincing.\n\n*novelty*\n- The idea of utilizing a neural network to select correct outputs to augment examples for disambiguating the possible programs is intuitive and convincing. This paper presents an effective way to implement this idea.\n\n*technical contribution*\n- The paper investigates a set of network architectures and ways to specify the network input for learning the neural oracle. The RNN+CNN model that leverages both rendered views and features seems effective.\n\n*clarity*\n- The overall writing is clear. The authors utilize figures well to illustrate the ideas. Figure 1 clearly shows the proposed framework.\n\n*experimental results*\n- The presentations of the results are clear. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve generalization accuracy.\n\n*reproducibility*\n- Given the clear description in the main paper and the details provided in the appendix, I believe reproducing the results is possible if the dataset is available. \n\n[Weaknesses]\n\n*related work*\nThe descriptions of the related work are not comprehensive. Some neural program synthesis works explore a variety of mechanisms to encode examples and fuse their features, which are not mentioned in the paper. [Devlin et al. in ICML 2017] investigates different attention mechanisms to sequentially encode a set of I/O examples and performs pooling to merge them. [Sun et al. in ICML 2018] proposes a doubly encoding method to capture more details of examples and merge the features using a relation network. I believe it would be interesting to see if these methods could further improve the performance of the neural oracle.\n\n*experiment setup*\n- The experiments are not sufficient. While the claims look promising, the proposed method is only evaluated in only one dataset, which is not sufficiently convincing. I suggest the authors to also experiment the FlashFillTest dataset where string transformation programs are synthesized. \n- A more comprehensive description of the dataset is lacking. \n\n*experiment results*\n- I find it hard to judge the effectiveness of the proposed framework without seeing sufficient qualitative results. I suggest the authors randomly sample some synthesized programs (both success and failure) and present them in the paper.\n- I believe it is important to present some examples of the given I/O pairs, initially synthesized programs (p_1), found distinguishing input (x*), candidate outputs (y), the prediction of the neural oracle (i.e. selected outputs), the augmented examples (I \\cup {(x*, y*)}), and finally the next synthesized program. Without this, it is very difficult to understand the performance of the proposed framework and what could go wrong. \n\n*ablation study: the neural oracle*\nOnly the final performance (i.e. the program synthesis performance) is shown in the paper. I believe it would be helpful if the performance of the neural oracle was also presented. As the whole framework depends on how accurate the neural oracle can select the correct output, it is important to evaluate this. One way to show this is to simply show the performance of all the neural oracles (with different architectures) trained on D_S (the positive samples and the incorrect samples) or even D_{S+}.\n\nDevlin et al. \"RobustFill: Neural Program Learning under Noisy I/O\" in ICML 2017\nSun et al. \"Neural Program Synthesis from Diverse Demonstration Videos\" in ICML 2018"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1636/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1636/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Guiding Program Synthesis by Learning to Generate Examples", "authors": ["Larissa Laich", "Pavol Bielik", "Martin Vechev"], "authorids": ["llaich@ethz.ch", "pavol.bielik@inf.ethz.ch", "martin.vechev@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["program synthesis", "programming by examples"], "abstract": "A key challenge of existing program synthesizers is ensuring that the synthesized program generalizes well.

To summarize the results, we can see that the proposed method in the paper can perform about as well as existing hand-crafted constraints that guide the search process of the previous work, when training an oracle on the dataset with negative examples created by noising the positive examples.\n\nOne limitation of the method is that it would works best when there is a clear latent structure behind the outputs produced by the correct program, such as in the paper's target domain of generating UIs where there are clear aesthetic rules and design guidelines that make it possible to evaluate which output is most preferred. For other domains, it may be more important to evaluate the candidate program together with its output, which would make it similar to a re-ranking approach.\n\nI believe this paper presents a novel and insightful approach to creating programs from imprecise specifications. Therefore, I vote to accept the paper.\n\nSome questions for the authors:\n- How big was $\\mathcal{I}_i$ in the supervised dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{S+}$? Was it always 3?\n- I wasn't able to find any evaluation of a model trained on $\\mathcal{D}_U$, did I miss it in the paper?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1636/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1636/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Guiding Program Synthesis by Learning to Generate Examples", "authors": ["Larissa Laich", "Pavol Bielik", "Martin Vechev"], "authorids": ["llaich@ethz.ch", "pavol.bielik@inf.ethz.ch", "martin.vechev@inf.ethz.ch"], "keywords": ["program synthesis", "programming by examples"], "abstract": "A key challenge of existing program synthesizers is ensuring that the synthesized program generalizes well. This can be difficult to achieve as the specification provided by the end user is often limited, containing as few as one or two input-output examples. In this paper we address this challenge via an iterative approach that finds ambiguities in the provided specification and learns to resolve these by generating additional input-output examples. The main insight is to reduce the problem of selecting which program generalizes well to the simpler task of deciding which output is correct. As a result, to train our probabilistic models, we can take advantage of the large amounts of data in the form of program outputs, which are often much easier to obtain than the corresponding ground-truth programs.", "pdf": "/pdf/e38826be42dfd8f83e0dd46f45c4225c5274bf01.pdf", "paperhash": "laich|guiding_program_synthesis_by_learning_to_generate_examples", "code": "https://github.com/eth-sri/guiding-synthesizers", "_bibtex": "@inproceedings{\nLaich2020Guiding,\ntitle={Guiding Program Synthesis by Learning to Generate Examples},\nauthor={Larissa Laich and Pavol Bielik and Martin Vechev},\nbooktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2020},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJl07ySKvS}\n}", "original_pdf": "/attachment/10ea9c1036547d3a6f25dd596d29e1418b2a1731.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"reply": {"content": {"experience_assessment": {"required": true, "order": 4, "description": "Please make a selection that represents your experience correctly", "value-radio": ["I have published in this field for several years.", "I have published one or two papers in this area.", "I have read many papers in this area.", "I do not know much about this area."]}, "rating": {"value-dropdown": ["1: Reject", "3: Weak Reject", "6: Weak Accept", "8: Accept"], "order": 3, "required": true}, "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_experiments": {"required": true, "order": 7, "description": "If no experiments, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I carefully checked the experiments.", "I assessed the sensibility of the experiments.", "I did not assess the experiments.", "N/A"]}, "review_assessment:_thoroughness_in_paper_reading": {"required": true, "order": 5, "description": "If this is not applicable, please select N/A", "value-radio": ["I read the paper thoroughly.", "I read the paper at least twice and used my best judgement in assessing the paper.", "I made a quick assessment of this paper.", "N/A"]}, "title": {"value-regex": "Official Blind Review #[0-9]+", "order": 1, "required": true, "description": "Please replace NUM with your AnonReviewer number (it is the number following \"AnonReviewer\" in your signatures below)", "default": "Official Blind Review #NUM"}, "review": {"value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{500,200000}", "order": 2, "description": "Provide your complete review here (500 - 200000 characters).
