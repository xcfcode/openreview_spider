The writing can be cleaned up a bit; the concepts and definitions should be made more precise before acceptance.\n\nSlight nitpicky comments: \n\n* I was confused about what automated design means. Please remove this language or define it. (Specifically, you say the human designer would be freed to take on higher-level, but still \"design\", work.)\n\n* I'm confused about what the constraints are. The $$ \\mathbb{t} $$ variable is central to your taxonomy, but it is ill-defined. Please give several examples of why your definition of t captures common applications (drug design, images, etc), and what it *doesn't* capture.\n\n* I'm confused by this: \"When training a VAE, we can explicitly see that attempting to fit a good model introduces a term promoting entropy\". This is confusing: 'attempting to fit a good model' should say 'choosing to use variational inference to fit an approximate posterior distribution introduces a term promoting entropy of the learned approximate posterior over latent variables'.
