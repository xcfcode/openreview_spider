The authors submitted a response that addressed these concerns to some extent. However, in post-rebuttal discussions, the reviewers chose not to change their ratings, feeling that quality of writing still needed to be improved and that overall a significant revision and another round of peer review would be needed.

The table demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method on the additional datasets as well.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Reviewer #2 wanted to know the efficiency of a key step in our method}.$ The time complexity of the key step in our method is linear in the number of directed hyperedges. We use Simple GCN to efficiently perform the graph convolution operation. Emprically, we have also shown superior performance on the large-scale arXiv dataset\n\n\n$\\textbf{Reviewer #2 had questions on the applicability of our theoretical analysis to multiple layers}.$ Our analysis can be trivially applied to multiple layers ($d$ hops) by considering the graph corresponding to the adjacency $\\mathcal{A}=A^d$ where $A$ is the adjacency of the input graph. This is again motivated by the Simple GCN formulation in which powers of the adjacency are used to define the graph convolution.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Reviewer #1 expressed a concern on the model being fragile}.$. To address this concern, we have conducted more ablation studies. The results are shown in table 4 (section A.4.1).  It clearly shows that $1$ layer of DHN and $2$ layers of GNN give the best performance.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Reviewer #3 had concerns on the novelty of the paper}.$ To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore GNNs for soft semi-supervised learning. We propose a novel method for directed hypergraphs, demonstrate its improved performance, and provide five benchmark directed hypergraph datasets for soft semi-supervised learning.

This paper proposes a semi-supervised graph neural network method for hypergraphs.\n2. A generalization error bound was proposed adapted to the semi-supervised setting with Wasserstein's loss.\n3. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nThe algorithmic contribution of this paper is clear: it proposes a new network architecture that (1) initialize latent features H^{(0)}_E for hyperedges from a \"hyperedge graph\" and (2) learn latent features for each node and hyperedge using a GCN type network. Since the latent features are formulated as discrete distributions, a Wasserstein distance can be applied for training with the sinkhorn approximation algorithm.\n\nI think the weakness of this paper is two folds, which makes it not ready to publish. First, the paper claims that the performance gain results from the exploitation of directed hyperedges. This is reasonable if I barely see the results for Soft-DHN. However, I find the design of the hyperedge GNN to be fragile regarding the number of layers from the result in Table 4. Normally it is reasonable to use a two-layer GNN, but the result is very bad when doing so (see Soft-DHN 2 layers result in Sec. A.4.1). Also, the result of the proposed model is still good when not applying a hypergraph GNN. So I'm confused about where the performance gain comes from.\n\nAnother weakness is the paper writing. Below are a few comments:\n[Page 3, Sec. 3.1] By saying \"t\\neq\\Phi\", do you mean \"t\\neq\\emptyset\"?\n[Page 3, Sec. 3.2] Please introduce the notation (M, C) right after it first appears in the third line of Sec. 3.2.\n[Page 3, Sec. 3.2] The notation n,m are confusing. Do you mean m=|E|?\n[Page 3, Sec. 3.2] I cannot see how Z=h(\\mathcal{H},X_V,X_E) maps each vertex to a probability distribution. Do you mean each row of Z is a probability distribution for each vertex?\n[Page 4, Sec. 3.2] Please define E_D.

On the one hand, the vertex labels should be not only numerical or categorical variables but also probability distributions. On the other hand, hypergraphs provide a much more flexible mean to encode the real-world complicated relationship compared to the essential pairwise association. Specifically, the authors carefully obtain the generalization error bounds for a one-layer graph neural network. The experiments support the theory and provide the empirical verification of the proposed method. The appendix offers plenty of details that are helpful for the reader to understand both the theoretical and practical perspectives of this paper. Also, the code looks good to me. The structure of the provided codebase is clear and well documented.\n\nI have some questions and suggestions for the authors:\n1. In the method section 3.3, the authors said that \u201cA key idea of our approach is to treat each hyperedge as a vertex of the graph\u201d After this transformation, the graph could be super sparse. So I\u2019d like to know more about the efficiency of the proposed method. Because the datasets in this paper could not be considered as a giant graph. The efficiency could be much more critical for large-scale applications. Besides, such conversion could be one of the most significant technical novelty in this paper, which makes me worry about the methodology contribution of this submission.\n\n2. In the theoretical analysis section 4, there are lots of references for the existing lemmas and theorems. It could be much better if the authors could briefly review and summarize these equations before applying them. By the way, I appreciate the detailed appendix at the same time. But such a summary could complete the paper in a more self-contained way. Also, the authors should improve the writing of paper at the same time.\n\n3. In the experiments section 5, I wonder if the authors would consider some more challenging datasets with the larger graph to evaluate the proposed method. Also, the theoretical analysis is about one-layer networks, which looks technical sound to me. However, in practice, we could not only use the one-layer network for graph classification, even for a small graph.
