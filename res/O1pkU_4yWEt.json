The paper uses distant supervision to identify the entities with\ntheir corresponding concepts and uses a Russian pre-trained BERT model\nto perform the task. The most frequent 10K medical concepts are\nselected and the task is treated as a classification task.\n\nThe strength of\tthis paper is that it is probably (one of) the first\nto address NER and entity linking for biomed concepts in Russian with\na straightforward BERT model. The main weakness of the paper stems\nfrom the way the training/validating datasets are created.\n\nThe dataset is extracted from EHR notes\tand the\tlabeling is done by a\nsimple rule-based model that involves exact matching. I'm not\nconvinced that this is going to have general coverage, and, hence, the\nmodel and the validation are biased to the entities for which exact\nmatching appear more often. The validation includes also a manually\nannotated portion (1.5K records) labelled only for the top 15 most\ncommon entities.

The authors use (a translated subset of) UMLS to match the unannotated corpus to generate distant training data, and then feed the training data into a BERT-based model to jointly perform named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN).\n\nI have the following major concerns about this submission:\n\n1. Based on my understanding (according to Figure 1 and Table 4), the proposed approach is performing multi-label text classification instead of entity extraction. The NER task aims to detect token spans in the text that represent an entity. It is an interesting proposal to simultaneously do NER and NEN, but you still need to output the location/boundary of the extracted entity in the text. Without this information, it would be difficult to perform downstream tasks like relation extraction.\n\n2. Several details of generating distant supervision are missing.\n- How do you expand \"all known abbreviations\"? Acronyms are a large source of noise when generating distant supervision. If you blindly match all abbreviations, there will be many false-positive training samples.\n- How do you deal with the conflict during matching? For example, given a word sequence w1w2w3, one entity in the dictionary can match w1w2, while another can match w2w3. What will be your matching result?\n- Shang et al. [1] point out that matching all possible synonyms of a word will also generate noise. They suggest that only when the canonical name of a word appears in the text, its synonym will be considered. Please consider comparing their strategy with yours.\n\n3. The paper only shows the results of its own approach. Several benchmark approaches need to be compared, such as Swellshark [2] and AutoNER [1].\n\n[1] Shang et al. Learning named entity tagger using domain-specific dictionary.

In particular:\n1) The model architecture does not bring any novelty. (It is basically BERT+Linear layer). The pretrained model helps improving the labelling task, but this has been already observed in many other NLP domains and papers. \n2) Distant supervision is attractive, as we don't rely on expensive labelled data, but the performance analysis is limited to a few (most-frequent) classes. In a domain like health, the long tail of entities can be crucial so this techniques might not be suitable for some use cases. \n3) It is too risky to claim human-like performance, when only one expert annotator has been involved.\n\nIn addition to this, it would be nice if the authors can address the following comments:\n- In related work you claim that \"Instead of using a contexualized representation of each token to classify it as an entity we use the representation of the whole text to extract all entities present in the text at once\". Can you clarify how this is achieved? \n- In addition to the number of classes in train versus test datasets, could you elaborate a bit more on other differences, e.g. average length of the documents, presence of some structured data within the documents (e.g. template)...\n- Is the fact that you used Russian datasets making your challenge harder? E.g would you be able to better leverage UMLS if you run similar experiments in medical records in English?\n- \"we decided to keep only terms that appear at least 10 times in the test dataset reducing the total number of entities to 4434\" -> Ideally, you should not rely on any clues or signals from the test dataset, so you don't bias your model toward specific categories present in the test data. I would suggest to repeat experiment without this step and report what happens with this less frequent classes too.\n- Section 4 is to scarce, more details about the model and the training should be included, for example: how did you pretrained RuBERT on electronic health records? E.g. how much data was available for this domain, for how many epochs you trained... Also, How do you think this is affecting the end2end performance of your model?\n- As stated earlier, one annotator is not enough for a proper human evauation. I suggest to be more exhaustive in this study and bring in some more experts to annotate the text, so we can calculate agreement score.\n- Please include more details when you refer to model's mistakes. e.g. \"Large number of model errors in case of \u2019Coughing\u2019 are due to a single term synonym that was almost completely absent from train dataset and present in test dataset.\" -> Indicate the term\n- Table 4: How can you quantify the improvement achieved by these entity extraction generalizations? The distant supervision is not able to capture those advanced use cases when labelling entites so, do you have ideas of how many of those you might be ignoring during your evaluation?\n- 150.000 training examples to achieve human-quality: Are you sure this is good enough?

The model combines a two-step process of NER and NEN into a single step on a multi-label classification task by distantly supervised training. The main contribution of this paper is to exploit a single transformer model to perform NER and NEN for HER data simultaneously by using the representation of EHR for a single multi-label classification task.   Empirical studies are performed to show the expected recall.\n\nPros: \n1.\tThe paper introduces distant annotation label data to avoid domain-expert costly annotations.\n2.\tApply pre-trained transformer-based model to finetune the proposed model in EHR data to do medical EE.\n3.\tLarge EHR data pre-processing \n\nCons:\n1.\tThe paper does not give the performance comparison with the state-of-the-art EE model.\n2.\tThe originality and significance of this paper is not enough, as it applies RuBERT on EHR data to do medical EE.\n3.\tIt is better to give additional evaluation metrics, such as precision and F score.\n\nMinor comments: \n1.\tIn the last sentence of the second paragraph in Related work, it should be \" into NER and NEN tasks. \" instead of \" into NER an NEN tasks. \". \n2.\tBrief introduction about RuBERT in model section.\n3.\tThere are some typos and grammatic error. \n", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3131/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper3131/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Distantly supervised end-to-end medical entity extraction from electronic health records with human-level quality", "authorids": ["ainesterov@sberbank.ru", "~Dmitry_Umerenkov1"], "authors": ["Alexander Nesterov", "Dmitry Umerenkov"], "keywords": ["entity extraction", "medical entity extraction", "named entity recognition", "named entity normalization", "electronic health records", "unsupervised learning", "distant supervision."], "abstract": "Medical  entity  extraction  (EE)  is  a  standard  procedure  used  as  a  first  stage  inmedical texts processing.
