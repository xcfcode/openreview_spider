This is done by learning an extension function g(z) from R^d to R^{D-d} and then using the change of variables formula on x and [z, g(z)]. To model probabilistically the deterministic function g(z) is replaced by Normal distribution with mean g(z) and a small variance.\n\nPIE is used to build deep generative models and trained on the MNIST dataset. The authors show that the models learnt via PIE produce sharper samples than VAEs and Wasserstein autoencoders (WAEs). No comparison to real NVP is made, which should be the main baseline of comparison to answer the question of \"what is the advantage of having d < D?\". Further MNIST is no longer a good enough benchmark to evaluate deep generative models. Most representative work in this literature use CIFAR-10, downsampled Imagenet, or Imagenet at 256x256.\n\nThis work falls short of the standards of ICLR in a few ways:\n\n1. The presentation is unclear. The explanation of the extension-restriction idea is overly complicated. Further, the paper does very little to properly contextualize this work in the literature. Real NVP and flow-based models are mentioned but the proposed technique is not compared to it. The authors say they \"introduce new class of likelihood-based Auto-Encoders\", but this is false as far as I understood. The technique is not even an autoencoder since a separate decoder is not trained, and is obtained by exactly inverting the encoder as in real NVP.\n\n2. The experiments are weak. The samples shown are of poor quality, and on a very simplisitic dataset (MNIST). The authors compare with vanilla VAEs, but ignore more recent improvements to VAE such as VAE-IAF, flow-based models, and also autoregressive models. A heuristic is used to measure sharpness and only used to compare against VAE and WAE. Since all these models allow likelihood evaluation, likelihoods should also have been compared.\n\n3.

The paper proposed a model named Pseudo Invertible Autoencoder(PIE) which combines invertible architecture and inference model.\n\nStrength:\n1. The explanation of the paper is very clear and consistent.\n2. The idea is interesting. A lot of papers related to the inverse problem focus on perfect invertibility, but the author(s) emphasize the importance of invertible compression and relate PIE to the inference model.\n\nPossible Improvements:\n1. The experiments could have been more convincing: 1) The only competitors are VAE and WAE. 2)The only data set has been tested was MNIST data set. There are many great works mentioned in the paper and those works should also be compared in a way.\n2. The content could be more compact so that more experiments can be shown to support the paper. It seems to me there is too much explanation to previous works in the paper. \n3. The paper has 9 pages which exceed the suggestion a little bit.\n4. I am not sure if the author(s) checked the grammar of the paper carefully. I found quite few typos in the paper. Page 3: 'Rather then' should be 'Rather than' and 'As we are interested' should be as 'As we are interested in'; Page 4: 'Can me' should be 'Can be'; Page 6: 'Better then' should be 'Better than'; Fig.6 (b): Should it be '0' or 'g(z)'?\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a good and clean paper in general. It explains the related work and presents PIE with necessary details. My biggest concern is that empirical validation(experiment) is poor. As a conclusion, I tend to vote for weak rejection.\n\nMinor Suggestion:\nRefer to the conference instead of arXiv if the paper was already published.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1388/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "PIE: Pseudo-Invertible Encoder", "abstract": "We consider the problem of information compression from high dimensional data.

From the text, I assumed g_k(z_k) should only be computed from those dimensions that will be processed further, correct? So in the case of the second layer, g_k(z_k) only from those 4 dimensions that will be processed further? So why are there green lines from all eight nodes of the second layer to the one node at the bottom? And what should this one node symbolize? r_k? Comparison between r_k and g_k(z_k)?\n\n2) What exactly is used in the generation of data/in the inversion for the values of the r's? In Figure 6 b) it looks as if you put in 0s? Shouldn't you put in g(z)? Or even sample from the gaussian with standard deviation eps_0 centered at g(z)?\n\nAlso wanted to mention two possibly related works for your consideration: In our paper \"Training Generative Reversible Networks\" https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01610 , we also use a reduced latent dimensionality, however without a rigorous mathematical motivation.
