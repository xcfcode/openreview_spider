The molecular graph information is only used in the encoder phase, since we cannot get the whole molecular graphs of the reactants when decoding.

Thank you very much.\n\n(4) We report the result of Rule-based Expert System, LSTM+Attention and Similarity by their original paper, not our re-implementation. We just re-implement the Transformer model's result since there have been 4 papers using Transformer to solve retrosynthesis, while they reported different results. So we had to re-implement it by ourselves.

We appreciate your approval of the meaning of our work. Our replies are as follow:\n1. Sorry for not providing the error bar in the original paper.  Here we provide the error bar of GET-LT1 (We experiment 3 times with different random seeds (41, 42, 43) ).  \n\nModel  | top-1 | top-3 | top-5 | top-10   \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGET-LT1 (our) |  59.1\u00b10.062 | 73.4\u00b10.276 | 76.4\u00b10.187 |  78.7\u00b10.179\n\nThe above is our current  result. We ensemble 10 GET-LT1 models with different parameters by averaging the models\u2019 probability vectors, i.e., the output vector of the decoder, to decide the generated SMILES character at each time step. By this way, we further improve the accuracy.\n\n2. Yes, bootstrapping Transformer model with multiple non-canonical SMILES for the same input molecules can improve performance. Someone has done this experiment. (It can be find in  https://github.com/kheyer/Retrosynthesis-Prediction) . With multiple valid SMILES, the model can learn the grammar of SMILES more easily and achieve better results.\n\n4. Compared with GET-LT2, GET-LT1 utilizes the atom information;  Compared with GET-LG, GET-LT1's learned representations are more determined by the Transformer and we think this is why it is better.  Since the decoder is a \"sequence decoder\", it may be better to give the \"sequential encoder\"(i.e., Transformer encoder) more weights while using the graphical encoder (i.e., Graph Encoder) as an enhancement. Thus, letting the representations first pass through the graph encoder and  then pass through the Transformer encoder may be better; Compared with GET-CT,  fusing two-level's embeddings in a serial way while not in a parallel way (i.e., concatenation) can get better representations.\n\n5. Yes, for the USPTO-50K dataset, our model's generative ability is the best. \n\n6. We can get the top-N results with N beam size. As N become larger, the model's generative confidence for the top-N's result decrease, i.e., top-1 > top-2 > top-3 > top-4 > top-5. Larger N will result in more molecules which are generated with less confidence, so the invalid rate will go up.\n\n7. We provide the concrete parameters of each model in our code. https://github.com/papercodekl/ICLR2020_MGET.

Previously, retrosynthesis prediction has been tackled as a language translation problem by using a Seq2Seq algorithm called \"Transformer\". This sequential approach was possible because molecules can be expressed as strings using the following format: Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES).\n\nDespite its good performance, language translation methods ignore the graphical structure of molecules. This paper proposes to add a graph neural network in front of the Seq2Seq/Transformer network to exploit the graphical structure, hence the name \u201cGraph Enhanced Transformer (GET)\u201d. The Graph Neural Network considered in this work also uses an attention mechanism similarly to Graph Attention Networks.\n\nThe main contribution is the addition of a Graph Neural Network to a Seq2Seq model for retrosynthesis prediction which provides state of the art results.\n\nFrom a machine learning / representation learning perspective, I do not consider the paper is innovative enough. Even so, the paper shows strong results for retrosynthesis prediction, I guess it would be a good fit in a chemistry conference.\n\n\nThings to improve:\n\nThere are plenty of works related to graph Autoencoders and Graph generative models that are not mentioned in the related work. It would be great to dedicate a section for them. Here some examples: \n\n- Li, Y., Vinyals, O., Dyer, C., Pascanu, R., & Battaglia, P. (2018).
