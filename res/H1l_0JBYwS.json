To my knowledge, this has not been done before. Prior work either derives sufficient conditions for the recovery of all blocks in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of nodes in the case of (Joseph & Yu, 2016), or lower bounds the number of small eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the unregularized graph on random graphs in expectation (therefore arguing in favor of regularization) in the case of (Zhang & Rohe, 2018). This paper, on the other hand, gives a precise characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (albeit in the case of a deterministic graph); the results are elegant and the analysis uses simple elementary techniques, which is very satisfying and seems to be easy to build on. The authors mention that they would like to extend this analysis to stochastic block models, which would indeed be interesting. The paper is also well written and the results are clearly presented. Overall, this is a nice contribution to spectral graph theory and so I recommend acceptance.
