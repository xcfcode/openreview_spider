Overall, the idea is interesting and the experiments study how a wide variety of GANS and VAEs (learned with different hyperparameters) behave as a function of the GILBO.

The main idea is to train a parametric model to map from generated samples x to corresponding latent variables z. \n\nThe authors perform quite large number of experiments on GANs and VAEs trained on MNIST and compare their proposed score (GILBO) with other scores and do qualitative analysis of the sample quality\n\nOverall I liked the proposed metric as it gives a new tool to compare the generative distributions of GANs and VAEs. I found the experiments on GANs quite interesting as they seem to suggest that GANs with high sample quality memorizes the data distribution. My main concerns are 1) how sensitive the bound is to the exact parameterisation and gradient descent training of e(z|x), 2) the experiments are only performed on MNIST and 3) that the lower bound is not a new contribution and  However, overall i think that the paper provides some nice contributions that is valuable to the ML community.\n\n\nQ1: In general - How tight can we expect the bound on the mutual information to be ?\nQ2: How sensitive is the lower bound on the exact parameterization of e(z |x)? Especially since we need to train this model using stochastic gradient descent it would be nice to see the variation for e(z|x) trained 10 times with different random seeds?\n\n\nQ3: I\u2019m not completely sure how the training works. In the abstract you state that you use a lower bound on \u201cthe joint generative density\u201d. I interpret this as e(z|x) is fitted as e(z|x) = N(mu(x), sigma(x)), for normal density latent variable models, where x is samples from the generative distribution (x \\sim p_generative) and z is the corresponding latent variables ? At least for GANs that seems like the only possible approach since we only know the mapping from z -> x. I think the paper could need some clarification here\n\nSome other comments;:\t\t\t\t\nI don\u2019t think you support the following statement with experimental results - so that should be deleted i think.\n\u201cBeing independent of data the GILBO does not directly measure sample quality, but in practice it correlates well. \u201c\nAlso, please make the axis-labels on the figures a bit bigger. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "GILBO: One Metric to Measure Them All", "abstract": "We propose a simple, tractable lower bound on the mutual information contained in the joint generative density of any latent variable generative \nmodel: the GILBO (Generative Information Lower BOund).
