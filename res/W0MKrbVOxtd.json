The input of the problem is a spatio-temporal sequence represented as graphs at time t-N+1 to t, where a graph neural network is trained to predict the graph sequence for time t+1 to t+M. The aim is to add perturbations to the input graph sequence, such that the predicted graph sequence varies from the ground truth as much as possible. \n\nThe novelty of the proposed attack model lies in that it does not require knowledge on the ground truth graph sequence. Instead, it uses an inverse estimation that uses the \"opposite\" of the graph at time t as the perturbation target. \n\nFor efficiency and practicality considerations, the vertex that has the maximum impact on the prediction output is computed using a heuristic algorithm, and perturbation is done on this vertex only. This makes the attack more realistic as only one vertex needs to be attacked rather than the full graph. \n\nPros:\n1. The problem studied is interesting. Spatio-temporal prediction problems have many applications, and many recent works on such problems do use graph neural networks to make predictions. \n\n2. Experimental results on real datasets show that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient. \n\nCons:\n1. The proposed models and algorithms are shown to be effective. One concern is on the technical depth. The modelling of the problem and the algorithms are relatively straightforward. There is a lack of performance guarantees and theoretical guidance on the choice of parameter values. For example, how much worse in terms of the attack impact when the weakest vertex is found by the heuristic algorithm instead of by a full traversal? Why is g bounded by 10 in Equation 9? Are there guidance on choosing \\alpha in Equation 4 beyond \"empirically\"? What is the relationship between the number of vertices attacked and the impact of the attack? \n\nAdditional comments:\nHow exactly are the experiments in Table 1 set up? Are all algorithms/models in Table 1 given the same input and ground truth output for the error calculation? If not (which seems to be the case based on the current wording), the comparison might be unfair. \n\nWhat are the meanings of \"position\" of a vertex and '-' in Equation 9? What is the intuitive idea that the genetic algorithm suits the problem to find the weakest vertex?  \n\nWhat exactly does the right arrow in Equation 5 mean? Assigning \\Tilde{g}_t to \\Tilde{g}_{t+1}? \n\nThe related work section claims that \"these works (i.e., works on adversarial attacks against recurrent neural network) focus on regular vectors or matrices, rather than irregular graphs.\" It would be good to clarify the difference between \"regular matrices\" and \"irregular graphs\", since graphs are often represented by their adjacency (or vertex feature) matrices.  \n\nTypo: Check the double quotes throughout the paper. \n\n**Update after author response:** I appreciate the authors' efforts to address my comments. Part of the comments on the presentation of technical details have been addressed, such as the meaning of \"position\" of a vertex and \"-\" in Equation 9. However, the main concern in terms of the technical depth has not been addressed well. There is a lack of performance guarantees and theoretical guidance on the choice of parameter values. For example, how much worse in terms of the attack impact when the weakest vertex is found by the heuristic algorithm instead of by a full traversal? The results in Section 4.2 and Table 3 are empirical and not theoretical. As such, I could not change to a more positive rating.

For PeMS data, the proposed one can find the same weakest vertex as the complete traversal and only use 60% time cost.\n\n\nthe penalty \\alpha in Equation 4 is set as 100 to make sure the scale of the penalty term is much larger than the scale of the first term so that the scale of perturbations can be strictly forced. There is almost no difference between 100, 1000, \u2026. We add this statement in 3.2.2. Thanks for your comment.\n\nThe g in Equation 9 control the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency. When g is extremely large, the proposed weakest vertex location solution is as same as the full traversal.\n\nWe attack only one pixel because of the real-world constraint. For spatiotemporal forecasting applications, the graph is determined by the sensor network that collects data. Take traffic forecasting for instance, the graph covers almost 1000 km2. Supposing vertex A and vertex are not neighbors, the distance between A and B might be 100km. It is complicated to attack A and B by the proposed one-vertex attack algorithm at the same time with different Harker vehicles in the real world (because the traffic flows in A and B are generally different). So we attack only one vertex to evaluate the spatiotemporal forecasting models. Attacking multiple vertices should be developed in future work.\n\n2.\nTable 1\u2019s experiment is set up as the same as the experiment section. Table 1 does use different input and ground truth. But errors calculated and compared in Table 1 are the exact errors that will be diffused into Equation (4) (7) (8). Table 1 clearly shows that the proposed inverse estimation can involve much less error in the perturbation computation, compared with the baselines listed in Table 1.\n\n3.\n\u201cposition\u201d of a vertex represents the real-world coordinate of the vertex. We target real-world forecasting applications. Our graph comes from the real-world sensor network that collects data continuously. Each sensor is a vertex, and it has its own coordinate on earth. \n\n\u201c-\u201d in Equation 9 represents the subtraction between different coordinates.  \n\nCandidates of the weakest node can be selected by a reward function. An iterative and time-saving solution is the genetic algorithm. It should be noted that the proposed genetic algorithm might not be the optimal one to locate the weakest vertex. The proposed one had outperformed other possible solutions as we had discussed in Section 4.2.\n\n4.\nYes, it is assigning. We replace Equation 5 with  \\Tilde{g}{t+1}<-\\Tilde{g}t , which might be easy to understand.\n\n5.\nOne matrix cannot represent a graph completely. A graph should be represented by two matrices at least. One matrix is the adjacency matrix that consists of the spatial correlation between different vertice. The other matrix is the vertex feature matrix. Moreover, we consider the spatiotemporal graph here. The feature matrix should be a tensor (multiple temporally dynamic matrix).  State-of-art spatiotemporal forecasting models [1][2][3][4] stated the difference between the normal matrix and graph. That is also the reason why these forecasting models outperform LSTM or GRU, because LSTM and GRU can only utilize part of the graph (the feature matrix only).  \n\n\n[1]Shengnan Guo, Youfang Lin, Ning Feng, Chao Song, and Huaiyu Wan.

For forecasting applications, we cannot know the true state at 3 pm when the current time is 2 pm, which is called \u201ccausality\u201d. As a result, true labels, that are widely used in perturbation computation in most previous adversarial works, cannot be applied in attacking spatiotemporal GNNs. The proposed one-vertex attack addresses the causality issue by the proposed inverse estimation.\n\n2.\n\nFor real-world forecasting applications, the input is generally pre-processed by well-developed solutions[1][2][3] to address the unfixed issues. State-of-art spatiotemporal GNNs forecasting models [4][6][6][7] also do not consider the unfixed issues because they are well addressed in the forecasting domain. The iterative issues are addressed by the spatiotemporal GNN structures.\n\nThe proposed method can locate the \u201cweakest\u201d vertex that can break the entire network severely. Attacking different vertice at different timestamps might be unrealistic. Take traffic forecasting for instance, the distance between two vertices (not neighbor vertices) might be over 100km. It is almost impossible to attack vertex A at 2:00 pm and then to attack vertex B that is 100km far away from A at 2:05 pm. Considering the real-world graph may cover almost 1000 square kilometers, we design a strategy that attacks the weakest one vertex to break the entire forecasting model.\n\n3.\nOur universal attack claim is correct because the proposed universal attack is to attack every node by a common perturbation. The proposed universal attack is applied to locate the weakest vertex, and then the one-vertex attack is applied, which was detailed in section 3.2.3 and 3.3.\n\n4.\nThe graph topology-based attacking is unrealistic for real-world forecasting applications. The graph is determined by the sensor network that collects the data. Manipulating the topology represents ruining the deployed sensor network in the real world. When the sensor is moved, deleted, or added, the manager can easily sense it immediately.\n\n5.\nThe constraint is strictly forced by setting the penalty factor as 100 as we mentioned in 3.2.2. The scale of the second term (the penalty part) in the objective equation (4) (7) (8) is much larger than the first term, which results in keeping the similarity first. Our experiment also shows that the scale of perturbation is strictly forced. Figure 1(b) had shown the similarity between the true input and the poisoned input.\n\nBTW:\n\nWe all know deep learning is vulnerable. Deep learning, especially spatiotemporal GNNs, gradually applied in real-world forecasting applications. However, previous adversarial studies cannot directly be applied to attack these spatiotemporal GNNs, because of inaccessible ground truth, spatiotemporal structure, and the large scale of the real-world graph (large scale means attacking the entire network is unrealistic), which was detailed in the related work section. As a result, the robustness and vulnerability of these spatiotemporal forecasting models cannot be evaluated. We proposed the one-vertex attack, that uses no ground truth and breaks forecasting models by poisoning only one vertex, to make up the gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Zhang Z.

First, one-pixel attack relies on the ground truth to compute the perturbations, while the ground truth is not available in spatiotemporal forecasting applications. Second, one-pixel attack focuses on poisoning images that are regular matrice, and it does not consider any temporal patterns and correlations. For spatiotemporal forecasting applications, the data structure is the temporally dynamic graph. \n\nAll in all, one vertex attack and one-pixel attack are two different methods targeting two different applications.\n\n2.\nIt is extremely important to implement the one vertex attack to evaluate the robustness and vulnerability of real-world spatiotemporal forecasting models.  \n\nAs we had already mentioned in the second paragraph in section 3.4, all attacking strategies that poison all vertice are unrealistic in real-world applications. \n\nTake traffic forecasting for example, the entire graph consists of hundreds even thousands of vertice that are loop detectors deployed in real-world road networks.

First, it formally defines the adversarial attack into optimization problem and uses a genetic algorithm to solve it. \n\nPros:\n1. To my best of knowledge,  none adversarial attack has been applied to spatialtemporal graph neural network. And the spatialtemporal graph neural network has its uniqueness in terms of unfixed input and graph property.\n2. The attack performance seems reasonable.\n\nCons:\n1. While it has proposed a new attack towards the spatialtemporal graph neural network, the novelty of the proposed method is not significant. It could just be treated as attack the node features on a normal graph neural network to predict the next node' label. \n2. The difficulty of unfixed or interactive input on spatialtemporal graph neural network is avoided instead of solving it. There are some papers like [1][2] that already attack the interactive input and address the problem instead of avoiding it. \n3. The universal attack claimed is not actually a universal attack. The universal attack is defined to use a common perturbation on features on every node instead of just one node. I suggest to take out the universal claims.\n4. While attacking the node attributes or features, it would be more interesting to utilize the graph topology as well, which is commonly discussed on the adversarial attacks related to graph neural networks.\n5. The constraint on the perturbation is actually a l2 constraint however it is a soft constraint. I am not sure whether the constraint is strictly forced. If not, how to measure the node feature's similarity after the perturbation?\n\n\n[1] Cheng, Minhao, Wei Wei, and Cho-Jui Hsieh. \"Evaluating and enhancing the robustness of dialogue systems: A case study on a negotiation agent.\" Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers). 2019.\n\n[2] Gleave, Adam, et al. \"Adversarial policies: Attacking deep reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10615 (2019).", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2509/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2509/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "One Vertex Attack on Graph Neural Networks-based Spatiotemporal Forecasting", "authorids": ["~Fuqiang_Liu2", "luis.miranda-moreno@mcgill.ca", "lijun.sun@mcgill.ca"], "authors": ["Fuqiang Liu", "Luis Miranda Moreno", "Lijun Sun"], "keywords": ["adversarial attack", "graph neural networks", "spatiotemporal forecasting"], "abstract": "Spatiotemporal forecasting plays an essential role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and numerous applications, such as route planning, navigation, and automatic driving.

The results demonstrate that the perturbation on one vertex can mislead the performance of the GNNs. \n\nAdvantages: \nThe idea of designing a single one vertex based attack is novel; the experiments are exhaustive, and the results validate the effectiveness of the attack method. \n\nConcerns: \nI think the technical contribution of this paper is weak in that: \n1. One-pixel attack [1] is not new, I don\u2019t see some novelties in designing the one vertex attack. The only interesting point is the expansion into the new scene of attacking GNNs.\n2. I'm wondering the efficiency of the one vertex attack. Is it really important to implement the one vertex attack? Besides, how's the attack success rate if the STGCN, DCRNN and Graph WaveNet are all aware of the attack method, i.e. the performance of attacks on defensed neural networks? For example, preprocessing is a routine method for defending against adversarial attacks. If the denfense side is aware of the attack, then how's the attack success rate when the attacked model is equipped with a simple filtering operation before the test sample are fed into the GNN?\n3. As far as I'm concerned, the adversarial attack and defense are the arms race, I'm not surprised the one vertex attack has a strong attack success rate since it is a white-box attacked and it computes the modification by solving an optimization problem. What really matters is why it is important to attack a GNN like network and what's the novelty, since we all know that deep neural network can be easily attacked by adversarial examples. I wish to see the real discoveries rather than just adapting an attack mechanism to a new classification task. \n\n[1] Su J, Vargas D V, Sakurai K.
