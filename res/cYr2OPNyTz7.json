And they show this technique improves accuracy in downstream tasks.\n\nThis idea is novel and interesting to me, and the derivation and experiment results look encouraging. However, I feel that experiments can be strengthened, and notations can be improved. Below are my major concerns:\n\nIf the major motivation is to reduce gradient variance, can we just use larger mini-batch size? In the experiments, it is not reported that the learning rate or the mini-batch size is well tuned for the baseline. I'd like some confirmation that larger batch size won't get much improvement for the baseline model. For example, in the continual learning, you said \"choose a batch size of 48\", that seems to be small to me?\n\nIn algorithm 1, in each iteration, only data sample (S_i) is used, how is this choice motivated? It'll be good to have some ablation study of the combined effect of using only one data sample in a mini-batch, and the full-explored masking. For example, if for the baseline model, we also only use one data sample and apply different masks, will there be improvement?\n\nIn experiments, mainly accuracy is shown, but since the major motivation to reduce gradient variance, why not show some comparison of gradient variance of MLM and MLM-FE?\n\nIn Sec2, you said \"yet is outperformed by the proposed fully-explored masking (see Table 2).\", do you mean Table 3?\n\nIn addition, I have several notation confusions:\n\nAssumption1: What is the hamming distance m_1 and m_2, when m_i are random variables? Do you mean the expected hamming distance? Or we are assuming x is fixed? Please be more clear.\n\nIn sec3.1, you used S_t for minibatch, but in sec3.4, you use S_i for \"a text sequence\", which is confusing.\n\nIn sec4.1, the authors said \"A batch size of 256 is employed, \", does that mean K=256 in Algorithm 1?", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2797/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2797/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Self-supervised Pre-training via a Fully-Explored Masked Language Model", "authorids": ["~Mingzhi_Zheng1", "~Dinghan_Shen1", "~yelong_shen1", "~Weizhu_Chen1", "~Lin_Xiao1"], "authors": ["Mingzhi Zheng", "Dinghan Shen", "yelong shen", "Weizhu Chen", "Lin Xiao"], "keywords": ["representation learning", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Masked Language Model (MLM) framework has been widely adopted for self-supervised language pre-training.

The motivation is to reduce the undesirable large variance of MLM objective, based on the hypothesis that randomly sampled masks in MLM would lead to undesirably large gradient variance, which as a result typically hurts the training efficiency with stochastic gradient optimization algorithms.\n\n---------------------------------------\nStrength:\n\nThe hypothesis from the variance reduction is interesting. The method is sound. Theoretical discussion proves that the gradients derived from the new masking schema have a smaller variance and can lead to more efficient self-supervised training. Experiments on both continual pre-training and general pre-training from scratch show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Case studies show that the method can help improve training efficiency. \n \n---------------------------------------\n\nConcerns & Questions:\n\n1. Regarding the proof, the notations in Section 3 are quite loose, especially for Section 3.1. It might be better to tighten them and put the proofs in the Appendix into the main body of this paper.\n\n2. The authors claim the variance of the K-masks gradient can be reduced by decreasing the gradient co-variance between different masks, but this is just for a given sentence and the problem still exists considering different sentences. \n\n3. The proof in A.2 is not persuasive, I cannot agree that equation 14 can be concluded through previous statements.\n\n4. In terms of the experiments, there are only dev results reported on GLUE (Table 2). It is hard to infer the test gains, given the possibly significant hyperparameter optimization on the dev set. It seems that the authors have the infrastructure for computing single-model test-set results. So why not report the test results?\n\n5. Why are the backbone models (RoBERTa and BERT, respectively) different in Table 1 and Table 2? I'm concerned whether these improvements will hold after optimizing BERT carefully like RoBERTa, or using more advanced backbone methods like ALBERT. Why not using a larger model (e.g., Roberta-large)?\n\n6. There is no comparison with other public masking methods in Table 2, such as whole-word-masking, span masking, etc. Did you use dynamic masking as that was previous used in RoBERTa? How about the benefits compared with the proposed one?\n\n7. Concerning the claim, \u201cthe proposed fully-explored masking strategies lead to pre-trained models with stronger generalization ability.\u201d, it is not clear how the proposed method yields stronger generalization ability. \n\n8. The ablations cannot serve the topic of this paper well. For the first ablation, it just gives out the performance of intermediate models on a single task. It might be better to give out the trend of training loss and validation loss. For the second ablation, why do all the larger splits lead to similar performance? Intuitively, doing more mask-then-predict procedures is better for learning language representations. The explanation at the end of Section 4 is not persuasive.\n\n---------------------------------------\nMinor issue: the citation format is not consistent, please check the usage of \\citep{} and \\citet{}.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2797/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2797/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Self-supervised Pre-training via a Fully-Explored Masked Language Model", "authorids": ["~Mingzhi_Zheng1", "~Dinghan_Shen1", "~yelong_shen1", "~Weizhu_Chen1", "~Lin_Xiao1"], "authors": ["Mingzhi Zheng", "Dinghan Shen", "yelong shen", "Weizhu Chen", "Lin Xiao"], "keywords": ["representation learning", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Masked Language Model (MLM) framework has been widely adopted for self-supervised language pre-training.

It is very novel and interesting that the authors try to understand the training of MLM by analyzing the relation gradient variance and masking scheme. \n2. They propose a new masking scheme that reduces the gradient variance. \n3. This paper shows the gradient obtained by the new masking is not biased. (Lemma 2)\n4. The performance improvement under continual pretraining and BERT pretraining looks good to me. \n5. The convergence is faster than the traditional MLM scheme. \n\n\nCons/Questions:\n1. One of my concerns is that in the usual MLM training, each sentence is observed very limited times (e.g., $\\leq 3$). Under such a setting, the overlapping between different maskings won't have too many overlapping. \n2. It would be better to validate the assumption by comparing the gradient variance between MLM training with and w/o the new masking scheme. \n3. It is not clear to me how Theorem 1/Assumption 1 motivates the new masking scheme. What does it mean by \" The covariance $Cov(g(m1),g(m2))$ is monotone decreasing in terms of the Hamming distance\"? Do you mean \"$Cov(g(m1),g(m2) | H(m1,m2)=\\tau)$ is monotone decreasing in term of $\\tau$\"\n4. In Figure 4 (left), it would be better to run the experiments multiple times and plot mean and variance.\n5. If we compare the result of 6-split masking of ACL-ARC (Figure 4 right) and the baseline (DAPT) in Table 1, there is actually no performance gain. I would say selecting an appropriate splitting number is tricky. It would be helpful to present the 1-split performance (i.e., DAPT) for better understanding of the results.\n\nMinor:\n1. The text in Figure 2 can be larger. \n2.

This paper then empirically shows that the covariance can be reduced by making the masks less overlapped. A modified version of MLM is proposed, which has been shown with a smaller gradient variance than the standard MLM. The experimental results show that the new masking strategy does lead to some gains on several benchmarks.\n\n\n### Strong Points\n- This paper rigorously shows that the gradient of MLM can be reduced by decreasing the covariance of the gradient covariance between different masks within the mini-batch. This is a very interesting observation and it is nice to see that this can be proved mathematically.\n- This paper is well-written and very easy to follow.\n\n- The experiment is also well done.\n\n### Weak Points\n- This paper is based on several important assumptions, none of which has been proved mathematically (although there are some empirical evidence)\n   + Assumption #1: the model quality can be improved by reducing the variance of the gradient.\n   + Assumption #2: the covariance of gradients can be reduced by increasing the Hamming distance between two different masks.\n- The empirical gain of the proposed method seems to be quite small. Given that the variance of the reported result is so large, it is unclear to me whether those gains are real.\n\n### Other Comments\n- Honestly, I don\u2019t quite see why the proposed method is related to continual pretraining, and why should it be included in the experiment section. Is it because you want to show that under the situation that \u201cin-domain data are usually much more limited\u201d the proposed method is still effective?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2797/AnonReviewer5"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2797/AnonReviewer5"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Improving Self-supervised Pre-training via a Fully-Explored Masked Language Model", "authorids": ["~Mingzhi_Zheng1", "~Dinghan_Shen1", "~yelong_shen1", "~Weizhu_Chen1", "~Lin_Xiao1"], "authors": ["Mingzhi Zheng", "Dinghan Shen", "yelong shen", "Weizhu Chen", "Lin Xiao"], "keywords": ["representation learning", "natural language processing"], "abstract": "Masked Language Model (MLM) framework has been widely adopted for self-supervised language pre-training.
