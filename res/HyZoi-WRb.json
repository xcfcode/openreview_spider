My remaining main comments are described in the response to author feedback below.\n\n[Original review]\nThe authors introduce jackknife variational inference (JVI), a method for debiasing Monte Carlo objectives such as the importance weighted auto-encoder. Starting by studying the bias of the IWAE bound for approximating log-marginal likelihood, the authors propose to make use of debiasing techniques to improve the approximation. For the binarized MNIST the authors show improved approximations given the same number of samples from the auxiliary distribution q(z|x).\n\nJVI seems to be an interesting extension of, and perspective on, the IWAE bound (and other Monte Carlo objectives). Some questions and comments:\n\n* The Cremer et al. (2017) paper contains some errors when interpreting the IWAE bound as a standard ELBO with a more flexible variational approximation distribution. For example eq. (1) in their paper does not correspond to an actual distribution, it is not properly normalized. This makes the connection in their section 2.1 unclear. I would suggest citing the following paper instead for this connection and the relation to importance sampling (IS):\nNaesseth, Linderman, Ranganath, Blei, \"Variational Sequential Monte Carlo\", 2017.\n\n* Regarding the analysis of the IWAE bound the paper by Rainforth et al. (2017) mentioned in the comments seems very relevant. Also, because of the strong connection between IWAE and IS detailed in the Naesseth et al. (2017) paper it is possible to make use of a standard Taylor approximation/delta methods to derive Prop. 1 and Prop. 2, see e.g. Robert & Casella, \"Monte Carlo Statistical Methods\" or Liu's \"Monte Carlo Strategies for Scientific Computing\".\n\n* It could be worth mentioning that the JVI objective function is now no longer (I think?) a lower bound to the log-evidence.\n\n* Could the surprising issue (IWAE-learned, JV1-evaluated being better than JV1-learned, JV1-evaluated) in Table 1 be because of different local optima?\n\n* Also, we can easily get unbiased estimates of the evidence p(x) using IS and optimize this objective wrt to model parameters. The proposal parameters can be optimized to minimize variance, how do you think this compares to the proposed method?\n\nMinor comments:\n* p(x) -> p_\\theta(x)\n* In the last paragraph of section 1 it seems like you claim that the expressiveness of p_\\theta(x|z) is a limitation of VAE. It was a bit unclear to me what was actually a general limitation of maximum likelihood versus the approximation based on VAEs.\n* Last paragraph of section 1, \"strong bound\" -> \"tight bound\"\n* Last paragraph of section 2, citation missing for DVI", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "Debiasing Evidence Approximations: On Importance-weighted Autoencoders and Jackknife Variational Inference", "abstract": "The importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) approach of Burda et al. defines a sequence of increasingly tighter bounds on the marginal likelihood of latent variable models.

They apply it for training and also as an evaluation method to assess the marginal likelihood at test time.\n\nThe paper is well-written and offers an interesting combination of ideas motivated from statistical analysis. Following classical results from the debiasing literature, they show a jacknife approach has reduced bias (unknown for variance). In practice, this involves an enumerated subset of calculations leading to a linear cost with respect to the number of samples which I'm inclined to agree is not too expensive.\n\nThe experiments are unfortunately limited to binarized MNIST.  Also, all benchmarks measure lower bound estimates with respect to importance samples, when it's more accurate to measure with respect to runtime. This would be far more convincing as a way to explain how that constant to the linear-time affects computation in practice.  The same would be useful to compare the estimate of the marginal likelihood over training runtime.  Also, I wasn't sure if the JVI estimator still produced a lower bound to make the comparisons. It would be useful if the authors could clarify these details.", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Debiasing Evidence Approximations: On Importance-weighted Autoencoders and Jackknife Variational Inference", "abstract": "The importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) approach of Burda et al. defines a sequence of increasingly tighter bounds on the marginal likelihood of latent variable models.

The intuition that this would lead to very similar gradients is wrong however: consider JVI-1, which is a weighted average of leave-one-out IWAE objectives.  If the ESS is close to one, then one of the leave-one-out IWAE objectives will not contain the dominant sample but be the IWAE on the remaining samples.  The JVI gradients are weighted averages of IWAE gradients and will effectively downweight dominant samples.  JVI-2 and higher-order variants have an even stronger effect because they leave out more than one sample.\n\nShared scale in Figure 3:\nWe agree this could be useful for comparing results across training objectives; the main purpose of Figure 3 is to demonstrate that within any regime higher order JVI estimates reduce bias and because the scales are quite a bit different between training objectives we opted to use space efficiently to that end.\n\nReporting bounds versus debiased LL estimates:\nWe do not have a comprehensive answer to this point and both views have merit:\n1. Reporting bounds across models provides an estimate of the model performance that is conservative/safe against deficiencies in tuning the inference procedure.\n2. Reporting more accurate LL estimates has the advantage of being a more accurate assessment of the model performance free of model-specific biases; for example, an ELBO may be bad in case the encoder is bad, despite the\ngenerative model being of good quality.  Also, in many cases the LL directly transfers into a natural metrics such as bits-per-pixel needed for compression.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Debiasing Evidence Approximations: On Importance-weighted Autoencoders and Jackknife Variational Inference", "abstract": "The importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) approach of Burda et al. defines a sequence of increasingly tighter bounds on the marginal likelihood of latent variable models.

We point this out in our revised version.\nRegarding the delta method, our proposition 1/2 are derived using the delta method for moments, as we write in the proofs to Proposition 1 and 2 in appendix A.  As reference we give Christopher Small's specialized book on the topic of asymptotic expansions in statistics (which we can recommend highly).\n\nJVI no longer a bound:\ngood point, we now make this a lot clearer in Section 5 of the revised paper.\n\nJVI-trained, JVI-evaluated worse due to local minima:\nWe have multiple hypotheses why this could be the case.\n1. In line with a hypothesis that was recently put forth in another paper by Rainforth et al., http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2017/papers/55.pdf, which is that the encoder network becomes more challenging to learn.  (You can see this by considering a perfect log-marginal likelihood objective; in that case the\nencoder gradient would vanish completely.)  To test this hypothesis we have investigated using two training objectives, where we use a regular ELBO for the encoder and a JVI or IWAE objective for the decoder.  This does lead to better encoders but initial results are not conclusively showing a benefit of JVI.\n2. JVI estimators are no longer bounds and perhaps the optimization moves the decoder into parameters which systematically amplify positive bias.  We do not know a simple way to test this hypothesis.\n\nImportance sampling:\nusing an importance-sampling evidence approximation and controlling the variance (or moment-matching) of this approximation is an interesting idea and in fact pursuing this exact idea led to the current paper.\n  The connection is as follows: for training we need log-marginal likelihoods to decompose additively over independent instances, and just as IWAE is biased, so will be importance sampling estimates (and annealed importance sampling, AIS, estimates).  For tractable sample sizes the bias is quite large, e.g. 2--4 nats for MNIST.  This made us consider debiasing corrections for IS objectives and led us to consider debiasing the IWAE.\n  Pursuing the IS route would be interesting for future work; the exact variance-optimal proposal is the true posterior p(z|x), but a sample version of minizing the variance can be used, see e.g. (Rubinstein and Kroese, \"Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method\", second edition, Section 5.6.2). Alternatively one can update the encoder using the regular ELBO criterion as we tried recently for our JVI objectives.\n\n\nExpressiveness of p_\\theta(x|z):\nthis is a general point for any latent variable model that we need to make sure that the observation model is expressive enough to model the statistics of the data.  It is not specific to VAEs.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Debiasing Evidence Approximations: On Importance-weighted Autoencoders and Jackknife Variational Inference", "abstract": "The importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) approach of Burda et al. defines a sequence of increasingly tighter bounds on the marginal likelihood of latent variable models.

But I\u2019m not particularly surprised that JVI during training does not result in better models compared to IWAE. We often observe very small effective sampling sizes when training big models with only few of the normalized importance weights is close to 1. It seems JVI would result in very similar gradients under these circumstances. I think it could strengthen the paper if this would be investigated and discussed.\n\nWouldn\u2019t a common scale for the LL plots in Figure 3 make it easier to read? \n\nDo you think it would be preferable if the community continued to report biased bounds instead of JVI estimated LLs? This provides a natural partial protection against overestimating due to low effective sampling sizes, doesn\u2019t it?
