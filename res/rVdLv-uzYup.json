The authors responded to some of these criticisms, bolstering the paper with additional experiments to show the benefits of joint inference and increasing the discussion of related work.  The reviewers examined the revisions and rebuttal and found the paper still did not resolve all their original concerns.  Two limitations mentioned in the final phase of the discussion were the use of a single environment to evaluate the general framework, and continuing doubts on the contribution of joint inference mechanism to the measured performance.\n\nFour knowledgeable reviewers indicate reject as their concerns were not adequately resolved.

It appears to be a combination of NEM [1] with a simple TD-learning objective on top. Results are a bit hard to interpret but seem promising.\n\nI\u2019m quite conflicted about this paper. \nOn the one hand, I find the problem that they\u2019re trying to tackle (i.e. object-centric RL) to be interesting, important and rather current. Their approach is also interesting, theoretically guided and sound. \nHowever on the other hand I found the choice of introducing yet another framework (which isn\u2019t terribly useful or novel either, see below) to be counter-productive for the paper; the derivations to be slightly strenuous (and one can argue already quite known in the field and expressed in simpler fashion elsewhere, see [2]); and perhaps of unclear novelty (i.e. what is novel in the perception aspect compared to NEM?). Finally, the results aren\u2019t extremely convincing and they do not compare to a model which is extremely related to their proposal (OP3 [3]).\n\nComments/questions:\n      \n1. I do not feel like the way the abstract and introduction argue for a general framework \u201cJoint Perception and Control as Inference\u201d is productive. As mentioned during the introduction, this isn\u2019t a particularly novel framework (considering RL as inference, all the work done in temporal generative model for RL, or the rather new formulation by Hafner 2020 [4]) and it doesn\u2019t appear like it provides a very interesting fit to the object-centric RL model proposed. \n   1. The derivations of section 3.2 are heavy, introduce a lot of notation, but ultimately aren\u2019t that complicated. \nHow do they differ from the similar derivations performed by Hafner et al, 2019\u2019s Appendix F (see [2])?\n   2. I understand that performing them for POMDP would be valuable, but then it would be more useful to address what is missing from existing methods and just show the required changes.\n   3. I would argue that the paper would be stronger if you only expressed the object-centric RL derivation, and put it into context with NEM and OP3, to express what is different about it.\n   4. I found the E and M steps derivations interesting, but they are effectively the same as shown in NEM [1]? Did I miss something? It would be more helpful to contrast them, instead of rederiving them.\n   5. Finally, the novel aspect of the control objective isn\u2019t actually used in practice, as a simple TD error method is used to train the policy, which others have done without taking a \u201cRL as inference\u201d stance.  \n2. The overall idea of the model is extremely close to what has been done in OP3 [3], where they combine sequential IODINE with policy heads to solve tasks while simultaneously learning an iterative inference generative model.\n   1. This work should be cited and thoroughly discussed. It also should be a baseline in the best of situations.       \n3. Does the proposed model also inherit the limitations of NEM? \n   1. For example, are you limited to black and white observations? \n   2. How computationally expensive is it to represent $\\frac{\\partial\\psi_k}{\\partial \\theta_k}$ with a neural network?      \n4. Figure 3 is relatively hard to interpret and quite noisy, which doesn\u2019t make the results extremely promising?\n   1. Starting with accumulated rewards makes it confusing, as one could be made to believe that the agents never successfully learn to perform the task and avoid poisons.\n   2. \u201cPeriod costs\u201d should really be called \u201cEpisodic returns\u201d, as this is really more standard.\n   3. The variance is very high and would benefit from extra seeds.      \n5. The performance of the learnt generative model in Figure 4 does not seem particularly great, especially given the simplicity of the domain considered? The segmentations are fine, but the reconstructions seem quite too blurry compared to current SOTA methods.      \n6. Given the similarity of the environments, COBRA [5] might have been a better baseline than the relatively unrelated VAE / World Model baseline selected.\n   1. I would also argue that COBRA should be cited in the \u201cModel-based Deep Reinforcement Learning\u201d as a closely related object-centric model-based RL method, it is more relevant than the World Model paper.\n\nSo overall, I\u2019d recommend rewriting the paper to be more explicit about its contributions and differences to existing works, as this would make it much easier to follow.\n\n* [1] Greff et al, 2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03498 \n* [2] Hafner et al, 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04551 \n* [3] Veerapaneni et al, 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12827 \n* [4] Hafner et al, 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01791 \n* [5] Watters et al, 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09275 ", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2409/AnonReviewer1"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2409/AnonReviewer1"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Joint Perception and Control as Inference with an Object-based Implementation", "authorids": ["~Minne_Li1", "~Zheng_Tian1", "pranav.nashikkar.15@ucl.ac.uk", "ian.davies.12@ucl.ac.uk", "~Ying_Wen1", "~Jun_Wang2"], "authors": ["Minne Li", "Zheng Tian", "Pranav Nashikkar", "Ian Davies", "Ying Wen", "Jun Wang"], "keywords": ["model-based reinforcement learning", "perception modeling", "object-based reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Existing model-based reinforcement learning methods often study perception modeling and decision making separately.

Hafner et al, 2019.**\nAs stated in Hafner et al, 2019's Appendix Section F, their bound is a variational bound for latent dynamics models, it does not include control as inference in their derivation as we do.\nOur notation for $o^t$ stands for optimality variable at time step $t$ rather than the observation variable in their setting.\nWe apologize if reviewers find some notations in our derivation unnecessary, we would be grateful if the reviewers could point out which part we could remove or simplify so we can improve the readability of the paper.\n\n**On the PCI comparison to Hafner et al, 2020.**\nAs discussed in *Connecting Perception and Control* of Section 2,\nwe argue that Hafner et al, 2020 provides a common foundation from which a wide range of objectives can be derived but sacrifices the precision in terms of a partially observable setting.\nEnvironments in many real-world decision-making problems are only partially observable, which signifies the importance of MBRL methods to solving POMDPs.\nHowever, the relevant and integrated discussion is omitted in Hafner et al, 2020.\nIn contrast,\nwe focus on the joint perception and control as inference for POMDPs and provide a specialized joint-objective as well as a practical implementation.\n\n**On the comparison between OPC and NEM.**\nAlthough OPC is built upon a previous unsupervised object segmentation back-end (NEM),\nwe explore one step forward by proposing a joint framework for perceptual grouping and decision-making.\nThis could help an agent to discover structured objects from raw pixels so that it could better tackle its decision problems.\nWe provide additional experiments in Sect. 4.4 of the revised version to demonstrate the difference between OPC and OP,\na perception model using the same architecture as NEM without reward signal.\n\n**On the novel aspect of the control objective.**\nPlease see the general response and Sect. 4.4 of the revised version.\n\n**On the naming of the axis label.**\nWe use *period costs* instead of *episodic returns* because each experiment for the curve in Figure 3 is a single run of the pixel waterworld without interruption,\ni.e.,\nonly one episode.\nTherefore,\nwe present the accumulated reward given a fixed number of environment interactions ($2e4$ of experienced observations).\n\n**On the quality of reconstruction.**\nOur implementation of the reconstruction model is based on the unsupervised perceptual grouping method proposed by [1].\nHowever, using other advanced unsupervised object representations learning methods as the perceptual model (such as IODINE [2] and MONet [3]) is a straightforward extension.\n\n**On additional related work discussions.**\nThank you for pointing this out and we have added the reference of OP3 in the revised version.\nAlthough several recent works have investigated the unsupervised object extraction for reinforcement learning (including OP3 and COBRA),\nour proposed OPC focuses on the joint framework for perceptual and inference as control.\nThe current unsupervised perceptual grouping implementation of OPC is based on NEM [1] but can be easily extended to other advanced methods such as IODINE [2] (the one used by OP3).\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Greff, Klaus, Sjoerd Van Steenkiste, and J{\\\"u}rgen Schmidhuber. \"Neural expectation

The perception and control as inference (PCI) framework, which describes the graphical model of a POMDP with auxiliary optimality variables, allowing for the derivation of an objective for optimizing both a perception model and policy jointly to maximize $\\log p(\\mathcal{O}, \\mathbf{x} \\mid \\mathbf{a})$. As the name suggests, this is similar to the control as inference formulation with a focus on partial observability and the addition of a perception model $q^w$.\n2. Object-based perception control (OPC), which is an instance of PCI using an object-factorized model.\n\nIncorporating a perception model into the the control-as-inference derivation to yield a single unified objective for multiple components in a pipeline is an interesting idea and complements other work on incorporating reward structure into model-learning nicely. (A discussion of some of these, such as [[Farahmand et al, 2017]](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v54/farahmand17a.html) or [[Oh et al, 2017]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03497) could serve to better highlight the difference between PCI and existing hybrid approaches, but these references are not \"missing\" in the sense that their absence is an issue.) \n\nHowever, the experimental evaluation does not really do the generality of this idea justice. It seems that this sort of approach would be favored only when the perception problem is too difficult for a standard maximum likelihood objective, as the joint objective would (presumably) bias the perception model to be useful for control. The main evaluation of the perception model, though, only shows four primitive white shapes on a black background being assigned labels. Unless there is underlying complexity not apparent in the image, this sort of input appears to be in line with what binary segmentation algorithms could work with, and likely would require no learning. The implicit argument made is that optimizing the joint objective causes these labels to be semantically-informed, but this is not supported by an experiment; the segmentation results in figure 4 are also what you would get by segmenting based on boundaries. \n\nSomewhat better support could come from showing what labels are assigned when two different object types are contiguous with each other (would food and poison be assigned the same label, or does the model separate them?), but in general it is difficult to support the claimed benefits with this particular environment. This is likely one of the reasons for the result described in the figure 3(c-d) ablations: when the environment is too simple (this time in terms of dynamics, likely, and not perceptual complexity), many of the design choices can become less consequential.\n\nAside from experiments, the presentation of the core ideas could also be improved somewhat. Section 3.2 in particular is difficult to parse, and presented in such a way that many readers will likely just skip over most of it. It is certainly a good idea to work out an approach in its full generality, but some of the components taking up space in the presented derivation are immediately cut in the experiments section (like the $D_\\text{KL}(\\pi~ || ~p(a^t \\mid a^{<t})$ term), so you might as well present a simplified version of the result that focuses on the method actually used. \n\n\n**Miscellaneous questions**\n1. What is the role of $p(a \\mid a^{<t})$? Is this to account for a recursive policy?\n2. Why do you think the world models baseline never appreciably improves upon its random initialization in figure 2b? I could imagine that the joint objective would cause OPC to perform a bit better than world models at convergence, but I am surprised that the perception is apparently so difficult that a separate modeling objective never gets off the ground at all.\n\n\n**Minor**\n1. Section 3.4: \"resulting a\" $\\rightarrow$ \"resulting in a\"\n2. There are a number of claims about human cognition that are not supported. For example:\n\n> OPC agent can quickly learn the dynamics of a new environment without any prior knowledge, imitating the inductive bias acquisition process of humans.\n\n> Moreover, in order to mimic a human\u2019s spontaneous acquisition of inductive biases throughout its life, we propose to build a model able to acquire new knowledge online, rather than a one which merely generates static information from offline training (Dehaene et al., 2017).\n\nIt is hard to say whether OPC mimics humans' knowledge acquisition without any sort of evidence.\n\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis generalization of the control as inference formulation could be influential given a more didactic presentation of the PCI derivation and an evaluation better suited to its claimed strengths, but it does not seem quite ready for publication yet.

The method is evaluated on a version of Waterworld environment.\n\nDecision\n-----------\nI think the paper is borderline, and I tend towards rejecting it in its current form. But I am open to increase my rating if the author address my concerns. Below are the main reasons for my decision.\n\n1. The separation between what is novel and what is already known is not clear from the paper. For example, it is claimed that the paper introduces a novel framework, however there is a number of papers working with the same framework but using different approximations, e.g., [1,2,3]. There is also a close relation to active inference papers, e.g., [4,5]. In my opinion, it should be stated more clearly in the paper that the main contribution is the application of the object-based perception model within the control-as-inference framework, and not an introduction of a novel framework.\n2. Following from the previous point, since the perception module is the main innovation, its evaluation seems insufficient. It is tested only on one environment. Would it generalize to other environments?\n\nReferences\n---------------\n[1] Ortega, P. A., Wang, J. X., Rowland, M., Genewein, T., Kurth-Nelson, Z., Pascanu, R., ... & Jayakumar, S. M. (2019).

The authors particularly focus on the case of hidden perceptual states linked to small image observations, which are composed of pixels belonging to up to exactly one object each. Their main proposal is denoted as OPC, which stands for object based perception and control, which serves the purpose of automatically discovering objects from pixels while controlling the system. \n\nIn order to posit the OPC model, the authors adopt one of the various recent unsupervised grouping models which assign one of K latent object identities to each pixel and hence group/segment images into K objects.  The rest of the model is a common POMDP setting set up to perform control as inference via usage of latent optimality variables per timepoint.\n\nOne of the major contributions in the paper is a well worked-out joint inference derivation, which performs amortized inference in this shared model utilizing an RNN.\n\nExperimentally, the authors verify their joint model on a waterworld environment, which consists of simple object shapes with semantics. They compare their model against baselines such as A2C with convolutional networks as feature extractors , A2C with the World Model (Ha et al) as a feature extractor (also based on convolutional networks) and a random policy.\nThey unsurprisingly beat these baselines.\n\nCriticisms:\nMy main problem with the paper is that the authors do not show that the joint model does anything. If they use one of these perceptual grouping models as feature extractors without joint inference, would A2C work well? Is it that feature layer that buys performance or a deeper interactions through the joint model they propose such that the actions resolve uncertainty about objectness in a nontrivial way they would not if used in a pipeline that doe snot perform joint inference. \nThis is not demonstrated convincingly and is a huge missed opportunity.\nI am left without a firm understanding if the highlighted contribution of joint inference benefits this model in any way.\nIn addition, all the baselines have 'monolithic' feature extractors , while pretty clearly object based feature extractors appear useful.\nI would also want to see a baseline where objects are known and we understand what the rest of their framework would do. \nIn general I find that even though the experimental framework is extremely toy, the authors have left a lot on the table empirically to demonstrate the utility of their method.\nIs the lengthy derivation of updates for the model worth doing if we don't collect this evidence?\nWhat is the time complexity in terms of EM steps that are needed?\nI am less concerned about the toy nature of the chosen experiment, as it would suffice to prove the concept the authors are after, if used sufficiently for empirical rigor.\n\nA secondary criticism is the lack of discussion and comparison to systems such as the Schema networks (Schema Networks: Zero-shot Transfer with a Generative Causal Model of Intuitive Physics by Kansky et al) which has long ago proposed object based planning modules and has not used object based models in the loop (yet).\nThere may be more such papers in the related literature which are on that thread of combining RL with object based representations that have not found their way in the discussions here and clearly should.\n\nOverall:\nI consider this paper interesting and agree with the authors that the proposal of joint models is appealing and worthwhile investigating, but I would require much stronger evaluation to show that the joint aspect of OPC is driving the performance here, instead of just the object-based featurization. In its current form the paper feels interesting, but unfinished.\nThe lapses in scholarship are also important to fix in order to fairly slot the paper correctly into the wider field.\nHowever, this paper is promising and I look forward to seeing it mature.\n\n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2409/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2409/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Joint Perception and Control as Inference with an Object-based Implementation", "authorids": ["~Minne_Li1", "~Zheng_Tian1", "pranav.nashikkar.15@ucl.ac.uk", "ian.davies.12@ucl.ac.uk", "~Ying_Wen1", "~Jun_Wang2"], "authors": ["Minne Li", "Zheng Tian", "Pranav Nashikkar", "Ian Davies", "Ying Wen", "Jun Wang"], "keywords": ["model-based reinforcement learning", "perception modeling", "object-based reinforcement learning"], "abstract": "Existing model-based reinforcement learning methods often study perception modeling and decision making separately.
