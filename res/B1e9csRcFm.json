We agree that from learning theory point of view, the techniques and results in Theorem 1 is pretty standard and does not tell anything deep. However, the point here is that its implications contradict the mainstream opinion that dimensionality determines everything, which warrants attention from the graph embedding researchers. In fact, we never argued that norm determines the performance of graph embedding from Theorem 1 alone, it is more based on empirical results. \n\nRegarding the empirical results, we have explained that the bell curve (best performance is obtained at an intermediate lambda_r value) is exactly what we should expect from Theorem 1. Cite my earlier comment (from point 1):\n\n\"Therefore, the implication of Theorem 1 is that there should be an optimal value for the regularization coefficient lambda_r: lambda_r being too small could lead to overfitting, while being too large would make it difficult for the embedding vectors to fit the training data. As a result, the generalization error should exhibit a bell curve when we vary the lambda_r value, which is exactly what we observed in Figure 5.\"\n\nThus, I'm confused about the last comment \"however, the best performance is obtained at an intermediate lambda_r value, which seems to contradict the claim of the authors.\" Can you explain a little bit more about it?"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Importance of Norm Regularization in Linear Graph Embedding: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Demonstration", "abstract": "Learning distributed representations for nodes in graphs is a crucial primitive in network analysis with a wide spectrum of applications.

In this case, everything will be trivially scaled by alpha^2: the expected loss (LHS of the inequality) will be multiplied by alpha^2, as well as the empirical loss (first term on the RHS). Then of course the deviation between the two will also be scaled by alpha^2, which is what the second term on the RHS tells us. I am not convinced that the result of the authors  really tells something deeper than this trivial observation as far as the embedding norm is concerned. In particular, the Rademacher complexity of any function family scales by alpha, if the learnt functions are allowed to scale by alpha. This holds for any learning problem and it is not specific to the graph embedding problem the authors have studied. So I am not comfortable with the interpretation of the authors, saying that it is the \"norm\" that determines the performance of graph embedding. \n\nHaving said this, my point is not to underestimate the impact of Theorem 1; I am not familiar enough with the literature on graph embeddings to judge this. It's just the \"norm interpretation\" that does not make sense to me. If this study is the first one to provide a dimensionality-independent bound, maybe this should have been the main focus of the paper instead. \n\nAbout the response of the authors regarding the experimental results: An experiment where the norm and the test error are studied on the same data sets and shown to have a nontrivially similar behavior, by varying e.g. lambda_r, would provide more solid evidence for the claim of the authors. In particular, comparing Figure 1(a) and 3(a) obtained on the same data set, we see that the smallest norm is given by for largest lambda_r, however, the best performance is obtained at an intermediate lambda_r value, which seems to contradict the claim of the authors."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/AnonReviewer2", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Importance of Norm Regularization in Linear Graph Embedding: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Demonstration", "abstract": "Learning distributed representations for nodes in graphs is a crucial primitive in network analysis with a wide spectrum of applications.

We will clarify these issues in the following:\n\n1. The main result of Theorem 1 bounds the generalization error of linear graph embedding in the form of training error plus the gap term. Therefore, to keep the generalization error  small, we need to ensure that both the training error term and the gap term should be small. Note that the gap term is C|A|_2/(m+m\u2019), and for this term to reasonably small (< some epsilon), (m + m\u2019) need to be greater than C|A|_2/epsilon. Therefore, Theorem 1 suggest that the required sample size for learning norm constrained linear graph embedding is at least O(C|A|_2), and otherwise the gap term would be too large and we can potentially experience overfitting. However, this estimate is not the most important implication of Theorem 1, see the comment below for details.\n\n2. The most important implication of Theorem 1 is that it outlines the importance of proper regularization of embedding norm: note that C is the sum of the squared norm of embedding vectors. Therefore, if C is too small (that is, we used too strong norm regularization), then it will be impossible for the embedding vectors to fit the training data well enough that the training error is small; on the other hand, if C is too large (the norm regularization being too weak), then the gap term would be large as well, and we will likely see the embedding vectors to overfit the training data.\n\n3. In general, if we vary the regularization coefficient lambda_r, the generalization performance should exhibit a bell curve, and the optimal performance is obtained by choosing the most proper value of lambda_r that balances the two terms above. This theoretical analysis is later supported by our experimental results: in particular in Figure 5, we see the exact behavior as we predicted above.\n\n4. The implication of Claim 1 is that if we do not regularize norm at all, then in theory the embedding vectors could arbitrarily overfit the training data. However, this is not what people have been empirically observing in the past: even in LINE (Tang et al., 2015) where only immediate neighbors are used as positive pairs, the embedding vectors still exhibit good generalization performance. This contradicting behavior lead us to suspect that SGD optimization procedure would naturally bound the norm of embedding vectors. In Section 3.2, we verified this theory through experiments. \n\n5. Our analysis in Theorem 1 works for the cases where each node has two sets of embeddings: as we explained in the footnote in page 2, the directed case  can be handled by associating each node with embedding vectors, which is equivalent as learning embeddings on undirected bipartite graph. The cases where we use different embeddings for context node and center node can be handled similarly and thus our analysis still holds.\n\n6. Our analysis does not generalize to non-linear graph embedding frameworks: most non-linear graph embedding frameworks involve using multi-layer neural networks (see related work discussion in appendix for details), which is fundamentally difficult to analyze. It is possible that norm regularization also plays important roles in those frameworks, but to confirm that requires additional investigations, which is out of the scope of this paper.\n\nWe have rewrote the paragraph after Theorem 1 to clarify the implications of this theorem, which hopefully will make things clearer. We have also corrected all the typos that has been pointed out. All the changes made in the paper are marked in red.

However, there seems to be a few misunderstandings regarding the implications of our theoretical analysis, which might have affected your judgement of our paper. We will try to clarify these points in the following:\n\n1. Theorem 1 states that the gap term (2nd term on RHS in Eqn (2)) is determined by the embedding norm (through C_U and C_V). However, the generalization error (LHS) is not only affected by the gap term, but the training error term (1st term on RHS) as well. Note that the norm of embedding vectors affect both the gap term and the training error term, as allowing the embedding vectors to have larger norm could potentially make them better fit the training data (and thus decreasing the training error). Therefore, the implication of Theorem 1 is that there should be an optimal value for the regularization coefficient lambda_r: lambda_r being too small could lead to overfitting, while being too large would make it difficult for the embedding vectors to fit the training data. As a result, the generalization error should exhibit a bell curve when we vary the lambda_r value, which is exactly what we observed in Figure 5.\n\n2. Figure 1-3 demonstrates various statistics (vector norm, norm of gradient, and generalization AP) throughout the course of SGD optimization, and should be looked at together (the x-axis being the number of epochs and have the same range). In particular, Figure 1 and Figure 3 collectively suggest that the generalization error is determined by vector norm. Note that Figure 1 by itself only lead to the conclusion that SGD results in small vector norm, and our final conclusion that generalization error is determined by vector norm is only obtained after Figure 3 (in page 6). \n\n3. The results in Theorem 1 is actually very surprising in the context of graph embedding: as we explained in Section 2.3, people have historically believed that linear graph embedding methods are computing low-rank factorization of the PMI matrix, and thus their belief is that the embedding dimension is the key factor for generalization, which have caused them to neglect the norm regularization in many cases. However, our generalization bound does not involve the embedding dimension term at all, which opens up the possibility that the embedding norm could be the key factor instead, while embedding dimension does not matter at all. \n\nThanks again for the helpful review, which makes us realize that we failed to make the implications of Theorem 1 very clear. We have rewrote the paragraph after Theorem 1 in Section 3.1 to address this issue. We also addressed all the minor issues pointed out in the comments.

The authors find that the term in the generalization bound that represents the function complexity involves the norm of the learnt coordinates, based on which they argue that it is the norm of the coordinates that determines the success of the learnt representation.\n\nI am not very familiar with the literature on graph embeddings; however, to the extent of my understanding of the paper, I have a number of concerns:\n\n- In a generalization bound like in Theorem 1, it is very typical of the generalization error to include a term that represents the complexity of the hypothesis function class. In the presented result, this would be the second term on the rhs, which involves the spectral norm of the adjacency matrix and the bounds on the norm of the learnt coordinates. This term captures the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis function class. In my understanding, there is nothing really surprising about this: most of the results in learning theory would include a term directly or indirectly related to some norm on the hypothesis function class. However, it would then require a lot of further justification to conclude that the key factor determining the performance is the norm of the learnt representation based on this.\n\n- I am not sure if the results in Figure 1 provide a really meaningful justification about the importance of norm. It is observed that the norm increases during the epochs, however, shouldn\u2019t we be also checking the evolution of the error at the same time to draw a meaningful conclusion? In particular, the norm seems to increase rather monotonically throughout the epochs, whereas we expect the error to decrease first, reach an optimal, and then start increasing due to overfitting. So can we really say that the error is proportional to the norm?\n\n- Similarly, in the results in Figure 5, we can observe that the regularization coefficient has an optimal value that maximizes the precision. On the other hand, the norm of the learnt coordinates is expected to decrease monotonically with increasing lambda_r. Again, it seems difficult to conclude that the norm is the key factor determining the error.\n\n- Minor comments: \n1. In page 2, in the expression of L, the node u should be in set V, I guess.\n2. Please define the function sigma used in the objective functions. \n3. Typo right under Section 3 title: \u201cgrpah\u201d\n4. The definition of matrix A_sigma is not clear to me. What does the \u201cthere exists y\u201d expression mean in the first line?\n\n- To sum up, my feeling is that the presence of the term involving the norm in Theorem 1 is rather classical in learning theory, and its importance seems to be over-emphasized in this study. Moreover, I am not fully convinced about the experimental evidence. Therefore, I cannot recommend accepting this paper.

This is not that intuitive to me. Later, the authors argue that graphs are usually sparse and average node degree is usually smaller than the embedding size, thus it is easily overfitting the training data. However, I would say, in practice, the positive training pairs are not restricted to 1-hop neighbors, but could also be 2 or more hops, in that case, it won't easily overfit. \nb.) the main result from the theorem is that the error gap of norm constrained embeddings scales as O(d^-0.5(lnn)0.5), but I did not see how this is related to the norms of the embedding vectors and how is this evidenced in the empirical studies? It might be better to show a plot of error gap vs. d and/or n. \nc.) how is this analysis related to the later claim that \\lambda_r controls the model capacity of linear graph embedding?\n\n- The linear graph embedding framework considered in this paper assumes that each node only has one set of embeddings, but in practice, one node usually has two sets of embeddings as context node or a center node. How would this affect the whole analysis and claims?\n\n- How would the claims or analysis in this paper be generalized to non-linear graph embedding frameworks?\n\n- For the experiments, \na.) In Figure 3, the y label of (b) is missing, and the Average L2 norm of (c) cannot reflect the Generalization performance \nb.) In Figure 4(a), why after overfitting, we can still observe that the test accuracy increases?\nc.) In Figure 5, why the test precision first increases and then decrease with more regularization?", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper560/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "The Importance of Norm Regularization in Linear Graph Embedding: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Demonstration", "abstract": "Learning distributed representations for nodes in graphs is a crucial primitive in network analysis with a wide spectrum of applications.
