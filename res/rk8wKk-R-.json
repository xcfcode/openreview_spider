However, we do strongly disagree that this should be the main lesson from the Melis et al. paper, and it's really orthogonal to the main point we are trying to make. The takeaway from the Melis et al. paper should absolutely not be that \"ordinary LSTMs get 60 perplexity on PTB\", but rather that extensive hyperparameter tuning _can_ improve LSTM results on any given task, effectively overfitting to the test set. And therefore, it's difficult to confirm whether much of the follow-on work in LSTM models (the subset of works that look at only a few relatively small datasets) is really improving the underlying model or just essentially working by tuning hyperparameters. The Melis et al. paper exactly points to the need to evaluate on a wider and more diverse set of benchmarks, where extensive hyperparameter optimization cannot simply \"overfit\" the data.  The authors are quite explicit on this point, even mentioning in one of their review rebuttals: \"The main criticism seems to center on evaluating models on datasets that are too small which increases evaluation variance, and the results are thus not trustworthy. That is a very good summary of the main message of the paper!\"\n\nWe also feel such large-scale hyperparameter search for _one_ dataset is not particularly informative (and most importantly, not representative of what practitioners would typically encounter). As the authors did not release the set of hyperparameters they obtained, we reproduced the LSTM result using the best hyperparameter set that we found in prior works and open source codes (without advanced regularizations). Moreover, given the message we want to convey in our paper, we believe it is much more important to evaluate a model's performance across tasks and datasets, instead of doing extensive hyperparameter search(es) on a single dataset.  The results for both the LSTM and TCN models use minimal tuning, and thus we feel are a good illustration of initial \"expected\" performance."}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convolutional Sequence Modeling Revisited", "abstract": "This paper revisits the problem of sequence modeling using convolutional \narchitectures.

The paper describes an architecture similar to wavenet with residual connections. Empirical results are presented on a large number of tasks where the convolutional network often outperforms modern recurrent baselines or reaches similar performance.\n\nThe biggest strength of the paper is the large number of tasks on which the models are evaluated. The experiments seem sound and the information in both the paper and the appendix seem to allow for replication. That said, I don\u2019t think that all the tasks are very relevant for comparing convolutional and recurrent architectures. While the time windows that RNNs can deal with are infinite in principle, it is common knowledge that the effective length of the dependencies RNNs can model is quite limited in practise. Many of the artificial task like the adding problem and sequential MNIST have been designed to highlight this weakness of RNNs. I don\u2019t find it very surprising that these tasks are easy to solve with a feedforward architecture with a large enough context window. The more impressive results are in my opinion those on the language modelling tasks where one would indeed expect RNNs to be more suitable for capturing dependencies that require stack-like memory functionality. \n\nWhile the related work is quite comprehensive, it downplays the popularity of convolutional architectures throughout history a bit. Especially in speech recognition, RNNs have only recently started to gain popularity while deep feedforward networks applied to overlapping time windows (i.e., 1D convolutions) have been the state-of-the-art for years. Of course the recent successes of dilated convolutions are likely to change the landscape in this application domain yet again.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and written. If anything, it is perhaps a little bit wordy at times but I prefer that over obscurity due to brevity.\n\nThe ideas in the paper are not novel and neither do the authors claim that they are. Unfortunately, I also think that the impact of the work is also somewhat limited due to the enormous success of the wavenet architecture. I do think that the results on the real-world tasks are valuable and worthy of publication. However, I feel that the authors exaggerate the extent to which researchers in this field still consider RNNs superior models for sequences. \n\n+ Many experiments and tasks.\n+ Well-written and clear.\n+ Good results\n- Somewhat exaggerated claims about the extent to which RNNs are still being considered more suitable sequence models\n than dilated convolutions.

In order to address points discussed in OpenReview reviews, comments, and our responses, we have updated our paper. The key changes are as follows:\n\n1. We\u2019ve added content to the Related Work section. This content elaborates on the relationship to prior work (e.g., non-dilated gated ConvNets, convolutional models for sequence to sequence prediction, etc.), in accordance with our responses to OpenReview reviews and comments. As highlighted in the revision, the TCN model we focus on avoids much of the specialized machinery present in prior work and is evaluated on an extremely diverse set of tasks rather than a specific domain or application.\n\n2. We have added experiments on the LAMBADA dataset, as suggested by Reviewer 3, which in fact show very strong performance for the TCN models.  LAMBADA is an especially challenging task where each data sample consists of a long context segment (4.6 sentences on average) and a target sentence, the last word of which needs to be predicted. In this setting, a human can perfectly predict the last word when given the context, but most of the existing models (e.g., LSTM, vanilla RNN) fail to do so. As shown in Table 1 of Section 4 in the revision, without much tuning (due to limited rebuttal time), TCN can achieve a perplexity of < 1300 on LAMBADA, substantially outperforming LSTMs (~4000 ppl) and vanilla RNNs (~15000 ppl), as listed in prior works. This is a strong result that suggests that TCNs are able to recall from a much larger context than recurrent networks, and thus may be more suitable for tasks where long dependencies are required.\n\n3. The appendix now includes a new section that compares the baseline TCN to a TCN that uses a gating mechanism.  This mainly serves as a comparison point to the Dauphin et al. paper, which one reviewer pointed out was not sufficiently addressed in our original draft.  Our experiments show that a gating mechanism can indeed be useful on certain language modeling tasks, but such benefits may not generalize well to other tasks (e.g., polyphonic music and other benchmark tasks).  Thus, while we do absolutely agree with the relevance of the Dauphin et al. paper, and stress this more in the update, we also feel that much the same considerations apply here as to e.g., the WaveNet paper, where the focus of the previous work was really on a single domain, whereas our paper stresses the generality of convolutional sequence models.\n\n4. The revision includes the latest results on certain large experiments (e.g., Wikitext-103).  Specifically, as mentioned in our responses, the TCN achieves a perplexity of 45.2 on this dataset (the only change from our original result was simple optimizing the model for longer), compared to an LSTM that achieves 48.4 perplexity.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convolutional Sequence Modeling Revisited", "abstract": "This paper revisits the problem of sequence modeling using convolutional \narchitectures.

and residual units and dilation structure that more directly mirror the corresponding \"standard\" architectures in convolutional image networks. \u00a0Thus, a practitioner wishing to apply WaveNet-style architectures to some new sequence prediction task may be unclear about which elements of the architecture are really necessary, and we attempt to distill this as much as possible in our current paper.\n\nOverall, therefore, we agree that the significance of our current work is largely making the empirical point that TCN architectures are not just for audio, but really for any sequence modeling problem. \u00a0But we do feel that this is an important point to make and thoroughly substantiate, even given the success of WaveNet.\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convolutional Sequence Modeling Revisited", "abstract": "This paper revisits the problem of sequence modeling using convolutional \narchitectures.

We respond to two different points here, because in our mind there are two different categories in the papers you mention.\n\nFirst, the Kalchbrenner et al., and Gehring et al., papers both relate to convolutional sequence to sequence models. While we absolutely agree that this work is related to our topic, we made the explicit choice not to consider seq2seq models in this paper. \u00a0The rationale for us is that these models differ in substantial ways from \"pure\" temporal convolutional models. \u00a0Since the input to the model is the entire input sentence (captured by non-causal convolutions), and only the autoregressive output network needs to follow causal generation, the task itself is quite different from pure temporal sequence modeling, even if it may be an extension. \u00a0Specifically, the two-stage encoder/decoder architecture (first to encode the entire input sentence, then to autoregressively generate the translation) of typical seq2seq models seems so fundamental to these approaches that we felt it was substantially more specialized than the generic temporal modeling problem.\n\nHowever, we also of course concede that the work is related, especially given the machine translation community's departure from pure recurrent networks to convolutional (or even pure attention-based) models. \u00a0Thus we will edit the paper to cite these works and address these points (we'll be posting a revised version within a week or so).\n\nSecond, there is the work of Dauphin et al., which more directly relates to a language modeling task. \u00a0And while we _do_ cite this work, we believe your point combined with the point in the comment below is more that we don't devote sufficient attention to this previous work. \u00a0We agree that the relationship is not clarified enough in the paper and are currently revising to fix this, but let us briefly mention here the connections and how we see this relationship.\n\nFirst, we should mention that while we did include the 48.9 PPL figure on one GPU, running the TCN model for more epochs (still on one GPU) actually achieves a PPL of 45.2, which isn't far off from Dauphin\u2019s 44.9. (Note that we use a network approximately half the size of Dauphin et al.\u2019s, and little tuning.) We'll naturally update the paper on this point. \u00a0Second, the main technical contribution of the paper of Dauphin et al. is the combination of (non-dilated) convolutional networks with a gating mechanism. \u00a0We experimented quite extensively with this gating mechanism combined with our generic TCN architecture, but didn\u2019t see significant overall performance improvements due to the gating mechanism. \u00a0We can include these results in an appendix. \u00a0Indeed, a main characteristic of our work is simply the claim that the generic TCN architecture (which is quite simple in nature, as we highlight) is _sufficient_ to achieve most of the benefits proposed by more complex convolutional architectures, without the need for attention, gating mechanisms, and other architectural elaborations. \u00a0We believe that the comparison to the Dauphin et al. work actually supports this conclusion, and we will update the paper accordingly (we will post a follow-up note here once the paper has been updated).\n"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Convolutional Sequence Modeling Revisited", "abstract": "This paper revisits the problem of sequence modeling using convolutional \narchitectures.
