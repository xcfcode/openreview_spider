The authors propose an evaluation on classical datasets and compare themselves to the state of the art.\nThe authors obtain interesting results on several datasets. They also explore the core of the unsupervised architecture and discover a neuron which activation matches the sentiment target very accurately.

Is it also competitive with the full model?\n- How does this method compare to an approach that first pretrains a language model on the training set of each corpus without using the labels, and then trains a logistic regression while fixing the language model? Is the large amount of unlabeled data important to obtain good performance here? Or is similarity to the corpus of interest more important?\n- I assume that the reason to use byte LSTM is because it is cheaper than a word level LSTM. Is this correct or was there any performance issue with using the word directly?\n- More analysis on why the proposed method does well on the binary classification task of SST, but performs poorly on the fine-grained classification would be useful. If the model is capturing sentiment as is claimed by the authors, why does it only capture binary sentiment instead of a spectrum of sentiment level?\n\nThe paper is also poorly written. There are many typos (e.g., \"This advantage is also its difficulty\", \"Much previous work on language modeling has evaluated \", \"We focus in on the task\", and others) so the writing needs to be significantly improved for it to be a conference paper, preferably with some help from a native English speaker.", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning To Generate Reviews and Discovering Sentiment", "abstract": "We explore the properties of byte-level recurrent language models.

So I simply put my comments on the paper here, and hope someone would correct me if I was wrong at some points.\n\nI found this paper interesting because of two things. First, several things from the paper are new to me. Second, I like the way the authors make a very good story from their experiments.\n\nUnsupervised representation learning is very promising since unlabeled data are every where. But to date, supervised learning models still outperform unsupervised models. This may be explained because \"supervised approaches have clear objectives that can be directly optimized\". Meanwhile, \"unsupervised approaches rely on proxy tasks such as reconstruction, density estimation, or generation, which do not directly encourage useful representations for specific tasks.\" The paper exploits other perspectives: distributional issue and the limited capacity of current unsupervised representation learning models. Specifically, \"current generic distributed sentence representations may be very lossy - good at capturing the gist, but poor with the precise semantic or syntactic details which are critical for applications.\" This combines with the limited capacity may be the root of devil, and the authors investigate into details this point.\n\nHow? The authors first attempts to learn an unsupervised representation by training byte (character) level language modelling. Then we can use the outputs to train a sentiment analysis classifier. The authors trained their model on a very large dataset (Amazon review dataset) (the training took 1 month!)\n\nGiven a new text (paragraph, article or whatever), we simply perform some pre-processing and then feed the text into the mLSTM. Here is the interesting thing: we then get the outputs of all the output units (there are 4,096 units) and consider them as a feature vector representing the string read by the model. We turned the model into a sentiment classifier by taking a linear combination of these units, learning the weights of the combination via the available supervised data. This is new to me, indeed.\n\nWhat is next? By inspecting the relative contributions of features, they discovered a single unit within the LSTM that directly corresponds to sentiment. This is a very surprising finding, as remember that the mLSTM model is trained only to predict the next character in text.\n\nBut why is it the case? It is indeed an open question why the model recovers the concept of sentiment in such a precise way. It is pity, however, that the authors don't dig into details to have a satisfied answer!\n\nOverall I like the paper and like their interesting findings. This is a very cool work!\n\nBut I think the paper could be significantly improved in two ways:\n\n- I don't think the story written in the paper is really coherent.\n\n- The findings are interesting but a deeper investigation would satisfy readers more. So far everything is still as \"I read a very cool paper which shows that there exists a neural sentiment neuron by simply training language modeling, but I don't know why!\".

When given sufficient amounts of capacity, training data, and compute time, the representations learned by these models include disentangled features corresponding to high-level concepts. Specifically, we find a single unit which performs sentiment analysis. These representations, learned in an unsupervised manner, achieve state of the art on the binary subset of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. They are also very data efficient. When using only a handful of labeled examples, our approach matches the performance of strong baselines trained on full datasets. We also demonstrate the sentiment unit has a direct influence on the generative process of the model.
