More precisely, for most problems in biology, ecology, meteorology, medicine and forestry, the time-lag (between the cause series and the effect series) follows a distribution which might be unknown, but is assumed to be stationary.\n\nThe Bayesian approach is very common, what is the highlighted content?\nIn other problems (e.g. natural language processing and translation), the correspondence between the input/cause series $x(i)$ and the output/effect series $y(i)$ is most often handled using bidirectional approaches or by exploiting the fact that input sentences and output sentences are mapped one-to-one. \nBidirectional approaches were not considered due to the intended usage of the model: one only sees the sequence up to now in order to predict the future. \nThe novelty of the proposed method can be seen by contrast with the vanilla alternative:\n* use the bidirectional approach for the training data, \n* infer independently the lag $\\hat{g}(\\mathbf{x}(t))$ and the effect $\\hat{y}(t + g(\\mathbf{x}(t))$\n* use vanilla regression on the two problems $x(t),\\ \\hat{g}(\\mathbf{x}(t))$ and $\\mathbf{x}(t), \\hat{y}(t + \\hat g(\\mathbf{x}(t)))$.\nThe problem with this vanilla option is that the errors on $\\hat{g}$ and $\\hat{y}$ will accumulate. \n\nOther issues: \n1- We use standard RMSE for both the synthetic and real problems, we thank the reviewer for pointing out this typo! \n2- the segmentation of the 2-5 days ranges into 12 segments; the more the number of segments, the more difficult it is for local models $\\hat{y}_i$ to be sufficiently diverse. Experimentally, the approach failed with 60 segments, and we did not investigate further the sensitivity of the approach to the size of $\\mathcal{T}$. \n3- the benefits of the saddle analysis: a clear benefit is to detect when the information in the data is insufficient, and can only lead to the trivial solution (predicting the average). Instead of proceeding by trial and error, we have a characterization of failure cases. In our experiments this is indicated by the value of $C_1$ (see table 1 at the end of the paper). A value significantly smaller than 1 indicates a differentiation of the model between the predictors.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper950/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper950/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Time Lag Regression: Predicting What & When", "authors": ["Mandar Chandorkar", "Cyril Furtlehner", "Bala Poduval", "Enrico Camporeale", "Michele Sebag"], "authorids": ["mandar.chandorkar@cwi.nl", "furtlehn@lri.fr", "bala.poduval@unh.edu", "e.camporeale@cwi.nl", "michele.sebag@lri.fr"], "keywords": ["Dynamic Time-Lag Regression", "Time Delay", "Regression", "Time Series"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new regression framework for temporal phenomena having non-stationary time-lag dependencies.", "abstract": "This paper tackles a new regression problem, called Dynamic Time-Lag Regression (DTLR), where a cause signal drives an effect signal with an unknown time delay.\nThe motivating application, pertaining to space weather modelling, aims to predict the near-Earth solar wind speed based on estimates of the Sun's  coronal magnetic field. \nDTLR differs from mainstream regression and from sequence-to-sequence learning in two respects: firstly, no ground truth (e.g., pairs of associated sub-sequences) is available; secondly, the cause signal contains much information irrelevant to the effect signal (the solar magnetic field governs the solar wind propagation in the heliosphere, of which the Earth's magnetosphere is but a minuscule region). \n\nA Bayesian approach is presented to tackle the specifics of the DTLR problem, with theoretical justifications based on linear stability analysis.

Algorithmically speaking, an attention-based mechanism would face a significantly lower signal to noise ratio compared to DTLR:\n* in order to train the transformer, the attention-based mechanism must aim to estimate $y(t)$;\n* therefore its input must be ($x(t - i), i \\in {\\cal T}$) to have the necessary information\n* $x(t)$ is of dimension $D$, circa a few hundred in the space weather application, and the size of $\\cal T$ is 12. \n* an attention-based mechanism would thus map a vector of dimension $D \\times 12$ onto a scalar;\n* this contrasts with DTLR, the input of which is $x(t)$ (vector of dimension $D$) onto vectors $p$ and $y$, both of dimension 12; \n* DTLR thus faces a signal to noise ratio which is better by an order of magnitude. \n\n2.

The setup is motivated by a problem in space weather that seeks to predict the solar wind from solar observations. \nA mixture of Gaussian-based model is proposed and a closed-form update for the maximum likelihood problem is derived in the paper. After providing extensive analysis for the alternating optimization of the parameters, the proposed model is tested in synthetic and real-world experiments, where it achieves state-of-the-art in solar wind prediction.\n\nThe approach of the paper to the problem is principled and it provides extensive theoretical and experimental results for further insight. Unfortunately, one of the main equations (equation 3) is difficult to parse due to its unclear notation and moving forward from that early point, I could not trust my interpretation of the presented model (to be more precise, use of subscript \u201ct\u201d for both x and y on the LHS, the summation index, and the probability space of p all use notations that I found confusing and problematic.)\n\nAs a separate note, early on, the paper argues against existing sequences to sequence models for this task due to their limitation in working with individual sentences. However, the paper proceeds to make a modeling assumption of the same sort which bounds the time lag. In light of this, I do think that transformer type models can be adapted to this setting, and in fact, an input dependent attention mechanism is ideal for combining the prediction of time-lag and the raw response in the output sequence. The expectation is for this type of model to perform well in the proposed setting.

For solving this regression problem, the authors use a standard Bayesian approach to fit the model. The analysis of saddle point in Section 3.2 is quite impressive and meaningful. Correspondingly, the practical DTLR algorithm iteratively updates the parameters and hyper-parameters.

The novelity of the problem posed is that the time lag g(x(t)) is allowed to be non-stationary and supposed to be unknown. The authors outlie a a Bayesian approach. The likelihood of the cause-effect data is conidered used to optimize the regressors for a given, finite set of time lags and the probability of these time lags. This discussion is very brief and detailled derivations are given in the appendix. An accompanying stability analysis is performed. In the implementation a neural network-based approach is used, where in turns the parameters of the model are optimised by a typical gradient descent algorithm and afterwards the hyperparemeters are set to values determined by the parameters. The theoretical deviation is accompanied by practical expirements on synthetically generated data and (real) space weather data. The performance of the model is compared to the one of a prediction with a fixed time lag, which it in fact outperforms. On the space weather (solar wind) data the model is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art models. A codebase for an implementation done in the Scala language is given.\n\nThe paper presented provides a meaningful contribution to the field of time series analysis and Bayesian methods. The novelty of the problem imposed as well as the accompanying solution is outlined very clearly. The problem is well justified and the motivation is clearly given.\n\nI recommend to accept it, even though a few details could have been described more precisely.\n\n1. The definition of the time lag g(x(t)) could have been made more clearly, providing a few examples at this point could help to clarify these definitions here.\n2. For the synthetic data generation a justification would be helpfull in order to motivate the choice of the functions f and v. \n3. A chart with sample time series data (y) against the time would be helpful to better visualize the problem.\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper950/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper950/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Dynamic Time Lag Regression: Predicting What & When", "authors": ["Mandar Chandorkar", "Cyril Furtlehner", "Bala Poduval", "Enrico Camporeale", "Michele Sebag"], "authorids": ["mandar.chandorkar@cwi.nl", "furtlehn@lri.fr", "bala.poduval@unh.edu", "e.camporeale@cwi.nl", "michele.sebag@lri.fr"], "keywords": ["Dynamic Time-Lag Regression", "Time Delay", "Regression", "Time Series"], "TL;DR": "We propose a new regression framework for temporal phenomena having non-stationary time-lag dependencies.", "abstract": "This paper tackles a new regression problem, called Dynamic Time-Lag Regression (DTLR), where a cause signal drives an effect signal with an unknown time delay.\nThe motivating application, pertaining to space weather modelling, aims to predict the near-Earth solar wind speed based on estimates of the Sun's  coronal magnetic field. \nDTLR differs from mainstream regression and from sequence-to-sequence learning in two respects: firstly, no ground truth (e.g., pairs of associated sub-sequences) is available; secondly, the cause signal contains much information irrelevant to the effect signal (the solar magnetic field governs the solar wind propagation in the heliosphere, of which the Earth's magnetosphere is but a minuscule region). \n\nA Bayesian approach is presented to tackle the specifics of the DTLR problem, with theoretical justifications based on linear stability analysis.
