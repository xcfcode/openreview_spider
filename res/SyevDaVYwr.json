Please find our responses below.\n\n\"This paper also introduces an assumption that the confidence score for each data is given. To me, this is also a strong assumption. Although the authors have provided examples of how to collect confidence score, collecting confidence scores may not be easy for many specific problems.\"\n\n- We agree that this is a substantial assumption. However, without any additional assumption the IDN setting is an ill-posed problem, hence the current lack of feasible solutions for real-world applications. With this assumption, we aim to propose a possible solution to this setting that has real-world applications as shown by the proposed examples.\n\n\n\"In this section, the authors further assume that the off-diagonal entries of the flip matrix are independent of instance. After seeing the explanation, I personally agree that the assumption is reasonable for some cases . However, I found that in the experiments, the authors synthesized label noise where the off-diagonal entries depend on the instance. The proposed method also shows its advantages on this case. Can you explain this?\"\n\n- Please note that we only assume that the off-diagonal entries of the flip matrix are independent of the instance conditionally on (\\hat{Y} \\neq Y). Therefore, following Eq. (5), we still have T_ij, i \\neq j as a function of x but T_ij(x) is only dependent of x through the diagonal term T_ii(x) since our assumptions boils down to \\alpha_ij(x) = \\alpha_ij. Sorry for the confusion, we will clarify this point in the following version.\n\n\n\"I have another concern that the obtained confidence score may not accurate. Is the proposed method sensitive to the confidence scores?\" \n\n- We are currently running some sensitivity analysis on the confidence scores and we will add the results in the following version.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible", "authors": ["Antonin Berthon", "Bo Han", "Gang Niu", "Tongliang Liu", "Masashi Sugiyama"], "authorids": ["berthon.antonin@gmail.com", "bo.han@riken.jp", "gang.niu@riken.jp", "tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au", "sugi@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Instance-dependent label noise", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Using confidence scores makes the instance-dependent noise model tractable.", "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels has drawn a lot of attention.

The authors propose confidence-scored instance-dependent noise (CSIDN) to overcome strong assumptions on noise models. They clearly define confidence scores and justify their availability. To solve CSIDN model, they propose instance-level forward correction with theoretical guarantees. Their experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the advantage of this algorithm.\n\nPros:\n\n1. This paper is clearly written and well-structured in logic. For example, in Section 2, they introduce from class-conditional noise to instance-dependent noise first, which paves the way for confidence-scored instance-dependent noise. This make readers easy to follow the main contribution, namely the new noise model.\n\n2. This paper pushes the knowledge boundary of learning with noisy labels, since it focuses on more realistic and challenge topic \"instance-dependent label noise\". The authors leverage the idea of confidence scores, and propose confidence-scored instance-dependent noise (CSIDN). Compared to previous solutions, CSIDN is a tractable instance-dependent noise model, which enjoys several benefits, such as multi-class classification, rate-identifiability and unbound-noise.\n\n3. This paper proposes an algorithm to solve CSIDN inspired by forward correction called instance-level forward correction (ILFC). Their algorithm has been verified in both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The empirical results show the advantage of ILFC.\n\n(Minor) cons:\n\n1. Section 3 is a bit dense in understanding the estimation of transition matrix. The authors are encouraged to polish this section. \n\n2.

We address\nyour remaining comments below.\n\n--- Major comments ---\n\n\"2. The other scenario considered by the authors is when there are\nmultiple annotators; however, there is substantial literature on\nlearning from multiple noisy annotations which the authors do not\nreview. I suggest the authors start with \"Modeling annotator\nexpertise: Learning when everybody knows a bit of something\" by Yan et\nal. (2010)  (and the citations therein) which also considers the\ninstance dependent noise case.\"\n\n- Thank you for this reference. We currently give a brief survey of\nworks modelling multiple annotator's expertise to produce more\naccurate labels in the Appendix, but we agree that the branch of\ndirectly learning with multiple noisy annotations is missing from the\ncurrent literature review and we will refer to those works in the following version.\n\n\n\"3. Under what conditions does the proposed algorithm converge and to\nwhat does it converge to?\"\n\n- Our method is shown to empirically showed to converge well (cf\nFigures 3 and 4). We plan on studying the proposed algorithm from a\ntheoretical viewpoint and derive convergence guarantees in future\nworks.\n\n\n\"4. The proposed method relies on several assumptions that are\nscattered throughout the description of the algorithm. I highly\nrecommend making these assumptions clear near the beginning of the\npaper. Specifically, my understanding is that the main assumptions\nare:\n\ni. Confidence scores r_x are available for each instance and r_x\n\\approx P(Y=y|\\bar{Y}=y,X=x).\nii. Y _|_ X | Y\\neq\\bar{Y}, \\bar{Y} = y\niii. Anchor points are available on some portion of the data.\n\nBeyond the presentation, I find this to be a fairly strong set of\nassumptions, particularly the first assumption.\"\n\n- These are indeed the main assumptions of our approach. We point out\nthat (i) and (ii) are currently stated in the introduction, but we\nagree that (iii) is missing and that the paper would benefit from\nmaking those three assumptions clearer. We will update the\nintroduction accordingly in the following version.\n\n\n--- Minor comments ---\n\n\"1. I really appreciated the synthetic example demonstrating the\npotential pitfalls of the small loss approach; however, I would spend\na bit more time clearly explaining the small loss approach so that\nreaders understand why it fails and how you are solving it's problems.\n\n2. Also in the synthetic example, the authors state that covariate\nshift leads poor accuracy, however, I think this point would be\nstronger if demonstrated instead of just asserted.\"\n\nThank you for those additional suggestions. We took due note of them\nand will aim to make those points clearer in the following version.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible", "authors": ["Antonin Berthon", "Bo Han", "Gang Niu", "Tongliang Liu", "Masashi Sugiyama"], "authorids": ["berthon.antonin@gmail.com", "bo.han@riken.jp", "gang.niu@riken.jp", "tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au", "sugi@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Instance-dependent label noise", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Using confidence scores makes the instance-dependent noise model tractable.", "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels has drawn a lot of attention.

If I understood correctly, what you show in your proof is that if (A) r_x = P(Y=y_hat | Y_hat=y_hat, X=x), then (B) it is a well-calibrated score (i.e. A-->B). I do not disagree with this. What the paper assumes, however, is the converse. That is, the paper assumes that if (B) r_x is well-calibrated, then (A) r_x = P(Y=y_hat | Y_hat=y_hat, X=x) (i.e. B-->A). Fortunately, given the conditional definition of calibration you stated above, this appears true:\n\nP(Y=\\hat{Y}|\\hat{P}=\\hat{p}(x), X=x) = \\hat{p}(x)\nP(Y=\\hat{y}(x)|\\hat{P}=\\hat{p}(x), X=x) = \\hat{p}(x) (the prediction is deterministic function of X)\nP(Y=\\hat{y}(x)| X=x) = \\hat{p}(x) (the confidence score is also a deterministic function of X)\n\nwhere \\hat{p}(x) is the determinist mapping of X to a confidence score and \\hat{y}(x) is the deterministic mapping of X to a label.

However, we would like to show that it is a proper confidence score because it can fit the definition of perfect calibration in the calibration area.\n\nThe perfect calibration is defined in Guo et al., i.e., \nP(Y_hat=Y | P_hat=p) = p,\nwhere P_hat is the confidence score. Note that neither X nor x is involved but this definition is still about the class posterior rather than the class prior. It is because Y_hat implicitly depends on X: Y_hat is a random variable obtained by wrapping a learned classifier f(x) on top of the random variable X, i.e., Y_hat = f(X) and y_hat = f(x). Thus, the random source of Y and Y_hat is from the underlying data distribution (Y itself and X respectively), but the nature of them are completely different.\n\nTo make our claim clear, we want to extend the definition of the perfect calibration, i.e.,\nP(Y_hat=Y | P_hat=p_x, X=x) = p_x.\nThe extension is reasonable because there is a confidence score for each single data point. In order to make it possible after adding X=x into the condition, we allow p_x to depend on x as well. Observe that X=x makes Y_hat no longer random but just y_hat or f(x); or equivalently, we can regard Y_hat as a one-hot random variable given X=x.\n\nSubsequently, we have\nr_x\n= P(Y=y_hat | Y_hat=y_hat, X=x)\n= P(Y=y_hat, Y_hat=y_hat, X=x) / P(Y_hat=y_hat, X=x)\n= P(Y=y_hat, X=x) / P(X=x)\n= P(Y=y_hat | X=x)\n= P(Y=Y_hat | X=x),\nsince Y_hat and y_hat are exactly equivalent given X=x. As a consequence,\nP(Y_hat=Y | r_x=p_x, X=x)\n= P(Y_hat=Y | P(Y=Y_hat|X=x)=p_x, X=x)\n= p_x,\nwhich concludes our proof that r_x is a proper confidence score similarly to P_hat.\n\nPS, letting the confidence score depend on x is very popular in importance reweighting and related learning methods, for example, a NeurIPS 2018 spotlight paper entitled \"binary classification for positive-confidence data\"."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible", "authors": ["Antonin Berthon", "Bo Han", "Gang Niu", "Tongliang Liu", "Masashi Sugiyama"], "authorids": ["berthon.antonin@gmail.com", "bo.han@riken.jp", "gang.niu@riken.jp", "tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au", "sugi@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Instance-dependent label noise", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Using confidence scores makes the instance-dependent noise model tractable.", "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels has drawn a lot of attention.

In section 3.1, the authors substitute the confidence score r_x for the conditional probability P(Y=y|\\bar{Y}=y,X=x); however, even if the confidence scores are perfectly calibrated, these quantities are not necessarily equal (or even particularly close). As defined in Guo et al. (2017), a confidence score is well calibrated if the probability that a prediction is correct given the confidence score is equal to the confidence score. Using their notation: P(Y=\\hat{Y}|\\hat{P}=p) = p. Importantly, this is not conditioned on \\hat{Y} or X. One way to see that these two quantities are not equal is to observe that there are many possible confidence score functions that satisfy the above definition whereas the conditional probability defined above is a unique function. In particular, if the confidence score function is a constant equal to the accuracy of the model, then the confidence score is well calibrated, but clearly not equal to the conditional probability above.\n\n2. The other scenario considered by the authors is when there are multiple annotators; however, there is substantial literature on learning from multiple noisy annotations which the authors do not review. I suggest the authors start with \"Modeling annotator expertise: Learning when everybody knows a bit of something\" by Yan et al. (2010)  (and the citations therein) which also considers the instance dependent noise case.\n\n3. Under what conditions does the proposed algorithm converge and to what does it converge to?\n\n4. The proposed method relies on several assumptions that are scattered throughout the description of the algorithm. I highly recommend making these assumptions clear near the beginning of the paper. Specifically, my understanding is that the main assumptions are:\n\ni. Confidence scores r_x are available for each instance and r_x \\approx P(Y=y|\\bar{Y}=y,X=x).\nii. Y _|_ X | Y\\neq\\bar{Y}, \\bar{Y} = y\niii. Anchor points are available on some portion of the data.\n\nBeyond the presentation, I find this to be a fairly strong set of assumptions, particularly the first assumption. \n\n--- Minor comments ---\n\n1. I really appreciated the synthetic example demonstrating the potential pitfalls of the small loss approach; however, I would spend a bit more time clearly explaining the small loss approach so that readers understand why it fails and how you are solving it's problems.\n\n2. Also in the synthetic example, the authors state that covariate shift leads poor accuracy, however, I think this point would be stronger if demonstrated instead of just asserted."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible", "authors": ["Antonin Berthon", "Bo Han", "Gang Niu", "Tongliang Liu", "Masashi Sugiyama"], "authorids": ["berthon.antonin@gmail.com", "bo.han@riken.jp", "gang.niu@riken.jp", "tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au", "sugi@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Instance-dependent label noise", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Using confidence scores makes the instance-dependent noise model tractable.", "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels has drawn a lot of attention.

However, almost all of the existing methods assume that the label noise is instance-independent. It either depends on the clean classes or is completely random. This paper studies the instance-dependent label noise, which is more realistic and applicable, but difficulty to address. The authors target to solve this problem. A feasible solution would contribute to the community a lot.\n\nThe challenging part for dealing with instance-dependent label noise is to learn the instance-dependent label flip function, which is hard to learn by only exploiting noisy data without any assumption. Few existing papers proposed assumptions to make the flip function learnable. This paper also introduces an assumption that the confidence score for each data is given. To me, this is also a strong assumption. Although the authors have provided examples of how to collect confidence score, collecting confidence scores may not be easy for many specific problems. \n\nGiven the confidence score, the authors proposed to learn the flip function. The clean class posterior can be inferred by using the noisy class posterior and the label flip function. So, how to learn the instance-dependent flip function is an essential step. Some technical contribution has been made to learn the flip function. In this section, the authors further assume that the off-diagonal entries of the flip matrix are independent of instance. After seeing the explanation, I personally agree that the assumption is reasonable for some cases. However, I found that in the experiments, the authors synthesized label noise where the off-diagonal entries depend on the instance. The proposed method also shows its advantages on this case. Can you explain this?\n\nThe experiment parts show the effectiveness of the proposed method both on synthetic data and real-world data. Overall, the paper is well-motivated and well-written. \n\nI have another concern that the obtained confidence score may not accurate. Is the proposed method sensitive to the confidence scores?\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper598/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible", "authors": ["Antonin Berthon", "Bo Han", "Gang Niu", "Tongliang Liu", "Masashi Sugiyama"], "authorids": ["berthon.antonin@gmail.com", "bo.han@riken.jp", "gang.niu@riken.jp", "tongliang.liu@sydney.edu.au", "sugi@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"], "keywords": ["Instance-dependent label noise", "Deep learning"], "TL;DR": "Using confidence scores makes the instance-dependent noise model tractable.", "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels has drawn a lot of attention. In this area, most of recent works only consider class-conditional noise, where the label noise is independent of its input features. This noise model may not be faithful to many real-world applications. Instead, few pioneer works have studied instance-dependent noise, but these methods are limited to strong assumptions on noise models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce confidence-scored instance-dependent noise (CSIDN), where each instance-label pair is associated with a confidence score. The confidence scores are sufficient to estimate the noise functions of each instance with minimal assumptions. Moreover, such scores can be easily and cheaply derived during the construction of the dataset through crowdsourcing or automatic annotation.
