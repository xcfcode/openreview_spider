The powerset of domain adaptation models is roughly described by the base model, weight sharing mechanism and the adversarial loss used (one note, I think CoGANs do actually tie some weights, no?). \n\nThe authors note that not all possible combinations have been used and thus try a discriminative model that uses the GAN loss and unshared weights. All in all, this is a reasonable thing to try (though there are clearly other missing combinations!). I'm surprised that the authors chose to fix the source model during training -- curious if that makes a practical difference. The Office results look decent (as much as we can glean from Office results to be honest). \n\nNB: I only read the workshop submission, not the full tech report cited within.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (workshop extended abstract)", "abstract": "Domain adversarial approaches have been at the core of many recent unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms.
