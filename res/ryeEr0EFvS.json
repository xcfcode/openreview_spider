Here is an initial response:\n\nWe agree with your intuition that the deeper layers in this case might not be useful because the first layer should be able to count the triangles. We said we \"handicapped\" the models because deeper/wider models might be able to use higher-order features to reverse predict the number of triangles, which would make the comparison to GCN unfair.\n\nOur (incomplete) experiments when writing the paper suggest a larger aggregation area does improve the performance on these tasks but not by a lot. Thus we decided to keep our synthetic experiments to 1-layer so that it is also fair to the GCN (i.e. theoretically 3-layer GCN can look 3 hops away). Of course, if you feel like it is needed,  we are happy to add these results.\n\nWe will add the prediction of an untrained baseline.

Here is an initial response:\n\n1. We completely agree that Xu et al. 2019 did fundamental work in this area, and Theorem 3 is a natural extension of the work they did. Xu's original theorem seemed to implicate that GNNs aggregating over the immediate neighborhood are naturally constrained to 1-WL, and we show that by very so slightly changing the definition of the immediate neighborhood (L_1 arguably is still the immediate neighborhood) gives theoretically greater power. Moreover, the fact that it captures triangles leads to favorable performance in many areas.\n\nFurthermore, we believe Theorem 1 and Theorem 4 bring new contributions: specifically Theorem 1 formalizes what the N-GCN paper was proposing (look at larger aggregation regions) and shows that our hierarchy is complete under any aggregating regions that can be defined under the distance metric.\n\nTheorem 4 shows that our framework can, in the limit, discriminate between all graphs. Graph discrimination from a local point of view is hard (as from a local point one does not know if there are other disconnected segments), and the proof required the use of a special case of the Graph Reconstruction Conjecture.\n\n2. We believe this would lead to the ability to better utilize node features in a more nontrivial/nonlinear way (as we can combine node features across greater regions) and should improve results for harder node classification tasks. \n\n3. We agree that the baselines are not absolute state-of-the-art in each of these tasks. However, N-GCN and k-GNN represent the SOTA in moving away from immediate node aggregations, and their innovations are not orthogonal to other innovations (attention, residual, etc) in GNNs that would enable it to achieve better results. We chose not to include these to show clearly where the result improvement is coming from. Our results show that just by adding the L1 aggregation region, we are able to exceed results from N-GCN (which were missing the L-type aggregation regions, but theoretically looks at information up to 6 hops) and k-GNN (3 hops), demonstrating the importance of utilizing the hierarchy.\n\nThe QM7b and QM9 datasets are extremely large chemical/biological molecule datasets which are prized as large real-world databases. This datasets were not specifically targeted for our purpose and the molecule dynamics are affected by many highly nonlinear, nontrivial, and nonlocal interactions between the atoms. Therefore, the fact that our models outperforms others in this regime is significant and potentially important for biological applications."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1107/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1107/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Hierarchy of Graph Neural Networks Based on Learnable Local Features", "authors": ["Michael Lingzhi Li", "Meng Dong", "Jiawei Zhou", "Alexander M.

Thank you for pointing out these works. We are happy to add these works into our comparison. We would like to stress that the results in these papers do not significantly change what we presented. Specifically, it does not appear that any of the papers cited exceed the SOTA benchmarks cited in the paper (specifically the comparable datasets NCI1 (SOTA: 86.1), MUTAG (SOTA: 92.6)), Proteins (SOTA: 76.5), PTC-MR (SOTA: 63.6) ).  We do not claim we exceed these SOTA in our paper, and the results in this paper show this. We are happy to be more clear on this.\n\nOur example architectures performed the best on regression tasks (QM7b, QM9) where we were unable to find better results in the literature, but we were also prudent and did not claim we are setting the new SOTA.\n\nFurther we would like to emphasize that this is a framework and the experiments are intended to show that powerful GNNs can be constructed in a straightforward way, exactly as you pointed out. This is by no means the \"maximum\" power available under this framework and a lot of what we proposed can be easily combined with the other innovations/advancements (attention, residual, etc) in the literature for even greater performance. The experiments intend to show that using our framework, we are able to achieve greater increase in performance compared to the GCN baseline than the previous SOTA attempts at doing so (N-GCN, k-GNN), despite looking at a smaller region (up to 2 hops) compared to k-GNN (3 hops) and N-GCN (6 hops). This shows the power of systematically adding features to a network.\n\n3. The \"randomness\" refers to the fact that a length-k walk can be any random length-k walk. This follows terminology used in the N-GCN paper and other papers which relate random walks to GNNs. We are happy to update the terminology to the \"set of all walks\" for clarity.\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1107/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1107/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "A Hierarchy of Graph Neural Networks Based on Learnable Local Features", "authors": ["Michael Lingzhi Li", "Meng Dong", "Jiawei Zhou", "Alexander M.

The design of new models is straightforward, and the theoretical analysis is trivial, given Xu et al. 2019. The paper would be improved if the author(s) can provide optimization or generalization analysis.\n\n2. The statement about experiments is misleading. The paper claims SOTA results on several datasets. However, this paper does not report recent SOTA results:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02670\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13192\n\n3.
