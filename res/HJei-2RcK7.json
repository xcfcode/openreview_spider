We have updated the paper with Appendix A-E to address reviewers' concerns and further demonstrate Graph Transformer\u2019s (GTR) performance. Here is a summary of these updates: \n\n(1) R1 expressed concern on comparison of GTR with previous methods which do not require the relations of meta-test and base classes a priori. We argue that the relation of categories GTR requires are universal and general (e.g., borrowed from WordNet taxonomy (Miller, 1995)), and the usage of which inherently follows human learning where reconciliation of data-dependent visual recognition and universal knowledge happens. Besides, WordNet taxonomy knowledge graph (Miller, 1995) is adopted in many related zero-shot learning papers (Wang et al., 2018; Kampffmeyer et al., 2018; Salakhutdinov et al., 2011) as prior meta-test and base classes relations. Our experiment proves that this reconciliation leads to stronger performance in the challenging few-shot setting, and the learning of complex causal relations among medical abnormalities and diseases which is essential for explanatory diagnosis.  \n\n(2) To address R2\u2019s concern on memory overhead of GTR, we provided theoretical analysis of memory usage in Appendix B, as well as experimental results on the relation between memory usage, model performance and model size in Appendix E. Our experiment shows that GTR is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance on 1-shot classification using less memory and parameters than its direct baseline model Gidaris & Komodakis (2018). \n\n(3)To address R3\u2019s concern on computational efficiency of GTR, we provided theoretical analysis on time complexity in Appendix C. Our analysis shows that with sequences and graphs as output, GTR costs constant training time, and linear to the output size and constant testing time respectively. Thanks to GTR\u2019s global attention mechanism, it has higher computational efficiency than recurrent neural network, and is capable of scaling to large graphs. The scaling capability is further enhanced by our proposed trimming scheme which promotes sparsity of edges. \n\n(4) We additional conducted ablation study on weight of prior edges (\\lambda) in few-shot learning, and provided results in Appendix D. Our experiment shows that prior relations of meta-test classes are beneficial, and the combination of which and automatic learning leads to the best performance.   \n\n(5) Besides the 10 baselines we have already compared with in graph classification task, we additionally compared with AWE (Ivanov & Burnaev, 2018) and FGSD (Verma & Zhang, 2017) in section 4.3 Table 4, and showed improved performance. We have also added more discussion of recent related work in Appendix A, including AWE (Ivanov & Burnaev, 2018), FGSD (Verma & Zhang, 2017), GAML (Do et al.,2018), graph2vec (Narayanan et al., 2016), graph2graph (https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xYr3C5t7), and graph2seq (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeXehR9t7; https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ske7ToC5Km), and highlighted the difference and advantages of the proposed approach. \n\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Transformer ", "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have gained increasing research interests as a mean to the challenging goal of robust and universal graph learning.

Message passing including intra- and inter-graph is a common strategy in graph neural networks (Do et al.,2018; Gilmer et al., 2017; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018). However, the underlying design, formulation, and effectiveness of models can vary drastically. Our proposed GTR is novel in that it uses a multi-head global attention mechanism to enable global context encoding and parallelism. These technical merits mitigate the challenging vanished gradients problem in RNNs due to sequential processing, and enables long-term relationship modeling and fast training which RNNs and most GNNs with only local context encoding suffer. Besides, the second last paragraph in section 1. Introduction details GTR\u2019s technical merits. \n\nWe have added more discussions of relevant approaches in Appendices A, including Graph Attentional Multi-Label Learning (GAML) (Do et al.,2018), and other  previous work or parallel ICLR submissions on graph transformation such as graph2vec (Narayanan et al., 2016), graph2graph (https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xYr3C5t7 ), and graph2seq (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeXehR9t7; https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ske7ToC5Km).\n\n2. Graph Transformer is able to process large graph inputs as the sparsity among edges can be promoted. For example,  in the few-shot learning experiments, we propose to trim edges by a threshold, resulting in a sparse graph representation. The sparser the graphs are, the easier for GTR to extract features from the most related nodes, and the faster the information flows among strongly correlated nodes. The user-defined sparsity degree controls the scalability of GTR to large graphs, and the intensity of modeling long-term relationship between nodes, which is lacked in many GNNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017;Defferrard et al., 2016). In addition, different sparsity levels in different GTR layers can also be implemented, so as to gradually distill significant high-level semantics from large low-level input graphs. \n\nIn our experiment of medical abnormality and disease classification on the CX-CHR dataset, the abnormality graph contains 155 nodes and the computation by our GTR model is fast. In contrast, in the experiments conducted in GAML (Do et al.,2018), the average numbers of nodes are only 27.68 and 25.31 for the 9cancers and 50proteins datasets, respectively, which are much smaller than ours.\n\nReferences   \n[1] Dehghani, Mostafa, Stephan Gouws, Oriol Vinyals, Jakob Uszkoreit, and \u0141ukasz Kaiser. \"Universal transformers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.03819 (2018). \n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Transformer ", "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have gained increasing research interests as a mean to the challenging goal of robust and universal graph learning.

We agree that for graph inputs such as knowledge graphs, positional encoding is not necessary since the input nodes are fixed and prior edges are given. We indeed do not use positional encoding in the experiments of knowledge graph transformation such as few-shot classification (section 4.1) and medical abnormality and disease classification (section 4.2), and graph representation learning (section 4.3). \n\nPositional encoding can be useful for sequence data (e.g., text) and visual data (e.g., image). For example, positional encoding can be used to encode object locations in an image. There is previous work (Liu et al., 2018) on incorporating positional cues such as coordinates as visual features to enhance representation learning and downstream tasks. We are happy to add ablation study on the effectiveness of positional encoding for visual features in our revised version. \n\n2. In terms of memory overhead, GTR scales linearly with the graph size thanks to the proposed global attention mechanism. It does not require any additional memory compared to the standard Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks. Please refer to Table 5 in the revised paper which summarizes the memory complexity for sequence and graph outputs.\n \nWe compute memory usage of GTR and baseline model Gidaris & Komodakis (2018), and conduct ablation study on model size on 1-shot learning in Appendices E as well as theoretical analysis in Appendices B. Specifically, we study how memory usage and model performance change with parameter size by changing feature dimensions and hidden feature dimensions, and fixing all other hyper-parameters. The results and analysis is summarized in Table 7. Most importantly, GTR using 512 as feature dimension and hidden feature dimension (last row of Table 7) only consumes 0.0278G memory which is less than that used by Gidaris & Komodakis (2018) (0.0407G), and obtains much better results (60.6778\u00b10.7095% v.s. 56.32\u00b10.86%). This demonstrates that GTR is not only effective, but also memory efficient. Furthermore, all results are still larger than that of all baseline models, maintaining GTR\u2019s state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the memory usage for medical abnormality and disease classification (section 4.2) and graph classification experiment (section 4.3) is only 0.0476G and 0.0217G respectively. \n \nIn terms of experiments on large datasets, the CX-CHR dataset used in the medical abnormality and disease classification is relatively large as it has 33,236 patient samples and 40,411 images in total where every patient can have multiple images. We are happy to conduct additional experiments on larger dataset. \n \nLast but not least, graph transformer holds several technical metrics that we missed to present in our initial version such as its time efficiency by requiring significantly less time to train than baseline methods, and only constant training and testing time for graph output. We add detailed explanation in Appendices C in our revised paper. \n\nReferences \n[1] Liu, Rosanne, Joel Lehman, Piero Molino, Felipe Petroski Such, Eric Frank, Alex Sergeev, and Jason Yosinski. \"An intriguing failing of convolutional neural networks and the coordconv solution.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.03247 (2018).\n\n\n\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1201/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Graph Transformer ", "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have gained increasing research interests as a mean to the challenging goal of robust and universal graph learning.

In such setting, any permutation of the 5 classes are still different task instances,  and thus the difficulty level of the problem is the same as that studied in previous few-shot learning works. WordNet (Miller, 1995) categorial taxonomy relations is an example we used for incorporating rich semantic knowledge in few-shot learning. It is similar to many existing work in zero-shot learning where the word embedding of novel classes are given a priori  for learning implicit relations of novel categories using pre-trained word embeddings (Socher et al., 2013;Frome et al., 2013), or explicit categorical relations such as the hierarchical structure of classes represented as knowledge graphs (Salakhutdinov et al., 2011; Deng et al., 2014). For example, (Wang et al., 2018) uses semantic embeddings of novel categories and the categorical relationships from WordNet knowledge graph to predict classifiers for zero-shot learning. (Kampffmeyer et al., 2018) follows this line and explores WordNet knowledge graphs of novel and base categories for zero-shot learning. In these methods, semantic features such as word embedding and knowledge graphs of novel categories are required as input. \n\nCompare to previous few-shot learning literature, our method indeed requires prior knowledge of novel category relations in addition to the few training samples of novel categories. However, this prior knowledge is general, universal, and can be easily obtained from rich textural semantic space (e.g., word embeddings trained from sufficiently large corpus, and WordNet taxonomy) a priori instead of hand-engineered. For example, the categorial relations in few-shot learning are borrowed from WordNet  taxonomy (Miller, 1995), and statistical computed from training data in medical abnormality and disease classification.  \n\nThe incorporation of prior categorical relations in few-shot learning highly aligns with human learning (Lake et al., 2015). For example, when teaching a baby what a bird is like, a teacher not only shows a few visual examples, but also provides verbal/textual descriptions of specific characteristics of the bird such that the baby can associate the novel category with categories that have already been learned. The learning process includes both visual understanding that is data-dependent, and contextual understanding which is universal and general. \n\nIntuitively, both universal and task-dependent categorical knowledge are beneficial for learning from limited examples. Graph Transformer demonstrates its superior capability of distilling information from prior universal knowledge, and effectively adapts itself for new training samples as specific tasks change. It also shows that the reconciliation of the universal knowledge-based and the task-dependent automatic learning are the key to success in empowering machine learning models in the few-shot learning task and the medical abnormality and disease classification task. \n \n\nReferences \n[1]  R.

The highest 1-shot accuracy is 61.58+-0.71% achieved when \\lambda=0.9. The accuracies of 5-shot learning for \\lambda=0.0 and 1.0 are 72.12+-0.64% and 72.95+-0.64% respectively. The highest 5-shot accuracy is 73.21+-0.63% achieved when \\lambda=0.7. It is worth noting that \\lambda indicates the weight on prior edges. So \\lambda=0.0 and 1.0 correspond to only using the learned edges, and only using the pre-defined edges respectively. \n\nBesides, the experiment shown in our paper was obtained only in the first round of our model, and used fixed learning rate 0.01 during episodic training. After allowing learning rate for episodic training to decrease 10 times whenever encountering validation performance plateau, we obtained the above improved results. The results demonstrate that: 1) GTR with prior category similarity improves few-shot learning performance over its direct baseline framework Gidaris & Komodakis (2018) on both 1-shot and 5-shot learning, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on 1-shot learning; 2) 1-shot learning relies more on the prior knowledge of similarity between base and novel categories than 5-shot learning; 3) GTR(\\lambda=0.0) is slightly lower than that achieved by Gidaris & Komodakis (2018), however not statistically significant, indicating that the attention mechanisms in both models have similar effectiveness in this task. We will add more ablation study in our revised version. \n\nFor the question on GTR for image input, images are usually first fed to a deep network for features extraction, and the extracted features such as the output of the last convolutional layer of a deep network are then used as input of GTR. Thus, the visual input to GTR generally has small size such as 5*5*128 and 16*16*256 (thus, graph node size is 25 and 256). In graph classification task, we adopted naive average pooling for aggregating node features for class-level graph classification. However, other techniques such as cluster-based pooling can be incorporated.
