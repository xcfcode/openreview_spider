We address your questions below.\n\n1. Stability of Gram-Schmidt\nBoth your approach and the Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) were added to our experiments. While we did not experience big differences between the Classical Gram-Schmidt (CGS) and MGS, we will add a discussion of numerical robustness to the paper acknowledging the quadratic dependency of CGS on the condition number of the input matrix [GLR05]. \n\nFurthermore, we agree that whenever possible simpler neural network modules should be preferred over more complex ones. Particularly when the uncertainty is isotropic (i.e. the first three entries of Z are equal) considerable reductions of the output space are possible and the proposed matrix V can be readily used. As you write in your paper, V(q) is an injective mapping (from a 3 dimensional manifold) to the ring of orthonormal matrices (which is a 6d manifold [Lee03, Example 8.33]). Thus, by using V(q), we would restrict the expressiveness of our loss model.\n\n2. Multi-Modal Representation\nWe are incorporating a discussion of how our approach can be extended to Mixture Models and are currently evaluating Bingham Mixture Density Networks. See the response to the reviewer above for further details.\n\nReferences:\n[Lee03] J.M. Lee, Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, Springer, 2003.\n\n[GLR05] L. Giraud, J. Langou, M.

As noted in [LPB2017], calibration and accuracy are two orthogonal concepts and, thus, require independent evaluation. We used the difference between EAAD and MAAD to get some insight into the former that can also easily be interpreted. In practice, the acceptable difference between these two metrics is application dependant. For instance, in certain grasping applications being a few degrees wrong about the orientation of an object might be more acceptable than the same amount of error in motion estimation on autonomous vehicles.

We address your questions below.\n\n1. \u201cYou only compared with one baseline. How does the model compare with a loss that is not based on directional statistics or Gaussian models?\u201d\n\nIn the newly added evaluations we included two non-probabilistic baselines for UPNA and IDIAP : The first loss is based on using a mean square error on the difference between the ground-truth and predicted quaternion and the second is a cosine based loss on the biternion representation. We will also add non-probabilistic baselines for T-Less.\n\n\n2. \u201cHow can you improve the model for multimodal cases?\u201d\n\nMost techniques that are used for estimating multimodal Gaussians are also applicable for the Bingham case. We are currently running evaluations using a Bingham variant of Mixture Density Networks on the T-Less dataset. Analogously to the Gaussian case, this may fail when trained directly. Thus, we first pretrain the MDN assuming the dispersion parameter Z to be fixed. Then, we train the entire network jointly. Similar strategies are also usual for Gaussian MDNs (as e.g. for the MDN baselines in [MICB19]).\n\nReferences\n[MICB19] O. Makansi, E. Ilg, O. Cicek, and T.

However, I would like to point out a couple of obvious issues that prevent this paper to be a good one:\n\n1. The Gram-Schmidt (GS) orthonormalization process is unnecessary and I would like to discourage the authors and the community from following that path. I understand that today's auto-grad methods make it seamless to use such arbitrary complex functions. But in this case there are two issues: (a). If one were to differentiate the GS by hand one would get a good grasp of the complexity involved. This means that the network will train or run slower. (b). Even if the computational aspects are not a problem, GS is known to be numerically unstable and one usually ends up with vectors that are often not quite orthogonal. Modified-GS (not employed in this paper) is one way to overcome this, but there is no guarantee to avoid the numerical issues altogether.\n\nUsing the parallelizable nature of quaternions, in our NeurIPS 2018 work, we have already given an alternative way as a more elegant solution to construct the M matrix for quaternions and this doesn't suffer from numerical issues:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.12279.pdf (look above equation 6). I suggest to employ that in future research.\n\n2. The paper only deals with the single modal case. This is of some limited interest only. I would certainly like to see a better treatment of this problem, rather than a half done solution.\nThe paper claims that it deliberately avoids using \"Mixture density networks\" (MDN) for evaluation reasons. However, even if used, MDNs are known to suffer for such higher dimensional and complex multimodal distributions. One certainly needs cleverer strategies and I encourage the authors to continue to work on the problem, making it a strong contribution. It is not very convincing to just leave out the multimodal scenario.", "title": "Good idea.
