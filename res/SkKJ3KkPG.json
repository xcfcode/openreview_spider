Rather than outputting a distribution over all possible classes, a query network receives as input the category it should predict, and it outputs a decision for that category alone. Experiments on a synthetic dataset demonstrate that query networks outperform multi-class networks when using smaller network architectures, and perform on-par with multiclass networks as network size increases.\n\nPros:\n(+) Clean, simple idea\n(+) Paper is clearly written\n(+) Mushroom dataset is interesting\n\nCons:\n(-) Similar to answer embeddings which have previously used for VQA\n(-) Some missing citations\n(-) Limited experiments\n(-) No discussion of test-time computational complexity\n\nNOVELTY\nQuery networks seem like a nice way to deal with complex output spaces; the notion that this allows the network to adapt its feature extraction to the particular category under consideration is intuitive. These query networks are similar to the answer embeddings used in state-of-the-art methods for VQA including [1] and [2] (which are not cited); however query networks are slightly different since they inject class information into the early CNN layers while answer embeddings for VQA inject this information into fully-connected layers.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\nThe experiments on the synthetic mushroom dataset show that the idea has merit, but I would have liked to see a bit more experimental evaluation. I appreciate the ablation study of different network sizes, but I would have also liked to see results on some standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10 or CIFAR100. I would also like to see experimental validation of the claim that query networks can \u201cadjust visual feature extraction based on the query itself\u201d; to test this claim the authors could for example compare with a version of the model where class information is injected into the fully-connected layers.\n\nThe mushroom dataset also seems like an interesting contribution on its own - will this dataset be publicly released?\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY\nOne downside of query networks compared to multiclass networks is that query networks will require C independant forward passes to fully annotate an image with C potential classes, while a multiclass network requires only a single forward pass. I would have liked to see some discussion of this potential downside.\n\nOVERALL\nOn the whole query networks seem like an interesting idea, and the paper presents some preliminary results demonstrating that the idea may be worthy of further investigation. The novelty and experiments are somewhat lacking, but may be sufficient for a workshop paper.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Jabri et al, \u201cRevisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines\u201d, ECCV 2016\n[2] Fukui et al, \u201cMultimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for Visual Question Answering and Visual Grounding\u201d, EMNLP 2016", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "An Analysis of Query-Based Approaches to Image Attribute Prediction", "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have emerged as the de facto method for solving many classification-based computer vision tasks.

This experiment seems to indicate that the query networks perform substantially better than standard networks at lower capacity. \n\nOne point of contention for me is the claim that the networks have the same capacity. Considering the fact that the one-hot query representation is tiled across the input map, the initial set of filters are something on the order of 3x3x(35+3) parameters compared to the 3x3x3 in the standard net.  Notably, only one set will be active at a time such during any forward pass only 9 extra weights can be active per spatial location. Furthermore, the primary point of restriction demonstrated in the results (Figure 3) is changing the width of the fully connected layers. This seems somewhat trivial that the multiclass network will do worse with fewer neurons given that same bottleneck needs to encode information about every attribute while the query network must simply encode the binary result.\n\nIn general, I think this paper is on the right track and has the potential to provide valuable insight; however, this workshop submission may be a bit premature.

We explore a similar setting which compares multi-class classification networks against query-based networks across a wide variety of attributes in a single image. We show that query-based networks outperform traditional multi-class networks given a fixed network capacity due to their ability to focus on information relevant to the current query. We also show that query networks learn faster than multi-class networks because their focus-based representation on specific attributes allows for more multi-modal flexibility per training iteration.", "paperhash": "walsman|an_analysis_of_querybased_approaches_to_image_attribute_prediction", "keywords": ["Attribute prediction", "feature representation", "visual question answering"], "_bibtex": "@misc{\n  walsman2018an,\n  title={An Analysis of Query-Based Approaches to Image Attribute Prediction},\n  author={Aaron Walsman and Daniel Gordon and Dieter Fox},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkKJ3KkPG}\n}", "authorids": ["awalsman@cs.washington.edu", "xkcd@cs.washington.edu", "fox@cs.washington.edu"], "authors": ["Aaron Walsman", "Daniel Gordon", "Dieter Fox"], "TL;DR": "We show the effectiveness of query-based networks on learning image attributes over the standard multi-class networks.", "pdf": "/pdf/ad5882a67d2425c77907495fdaddacc7ae7dd824.pdf"}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1518629844880, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Acceptance_Decision", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"], "reply": {"forum": null, "replyto": null, "invitation": "ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/-/Submission", "writers": {"values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "signatures": {"description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content.", "values": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs"]}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Workshop/Program_Chairs", "everyone"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 1, "value": "ICLR 2018 Workshop Acceptance Decision"}, "comment": {"required": false, "order": 3, "description": "(optional) Comment on this decision.", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{0,5000}"}, "decision": {"required": true, "order": 2, "value-dropdown": ["Accept", "Reject"]}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": [], "cdate": 1518629844880}}}], "count": 5}
