The authors demonstrated this tool by applying this tool to show some visualizations of some auto-encoders (VAE, WAE and AAE).\n\nPros:\n\n1. The paper is easy to follow and the visualization results are clear. It is easy to understand the metrics from the figures of the visualization tool.\n\n2. The visualized metrics are useful and can show the differences between the WAE and the AAE compared with the VAE, which means that the visualizations are successful.\n\n3. The visualization tool can also analyze the attributes in the latent space, which is useful.\n\nCons:\n \n1. It is better if more generative models (e.g. GAN) can be studied using this tool.", "rating": "3: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper24/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Workshop/DeepGenStruct/Paper24/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Interactive Visual Exploration of Latent Space (IVELS) for peptide auto-encoder model selection", "authors": ["Tom Sercu", "Sebastian Gehrmann", "Hendrik Strobelt", "Payel Das", "Inkit Padhi", "Cicero Dos Santos", "Kahini Wadhawan", "Vijil Chenthamarakshan"], "authorids": ["tom.sercu1@ibm.com", "gehrmann@seas.harvard.edu", "hendrik.strobelt@ibm.com", "daspa@us.ibm.com", "inkit.padhi@ibm.com", "cicerons@us.ibm.com", "kahini.wadhawan@ibm.com", "ecvijil@us.ibm.com"], "keywords": ["visualization", "peptide", "interactive", "auto-encoder", "vae"], "TL;DR": "We present a visual tool to interactively explore the latent space of an auto-encoder for peptide sequences and their attributes.", "abstract": "We present a tool for Interactive Visual Exploration of Latent Space (IVELS) for model selection.
