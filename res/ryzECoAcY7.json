However, we did previously run an experiment with 4-level agents in the inverted pendulum task using a slightly different version of HAC.  In this older version of HAC, the subgoal space was the concatenation of the desired Cartesian (x,y,z) end-effector position and the desired angular velocity of the pendulum (i.e. a 4-dim subgoal space).  Whereas in the latest version of HAC, the subgoal space in the inverted pendulum task is just the state space, which is the 2-dim vector including the angle of pendulum and the angular velocity of the pendulum.  A video of the 4-level agents in the inverted pendulum task is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NGMkQ29oU .  With the older version of HAC, we did find that the 4-level agents outperformed agents using 1, 2, and 3 levels of hierarchy in the inverted pendulum task.  \n\n\nR2/R3 - Can you provide ablation tests examining subgoal testing?  (R3) How does HAC perform without subgoal testing?  (R2) Does exploration noise need to be turned off when subgoal testing?\n\nWe have not implemented any ablation tests that examine subgoal testing using the latest version of HAC.  However, we did perform limited ablation tests using previous versions of the algorithm, and the results do support our implementation of subgoal testing.  With these previous versions of the algorithm, agents that did not use subgoal testing were not able to solve the UR5 Reacher task.  Similarly, we did previously implement an agent in the inverted pendulum task that penalized all missed subgoals.  In the single trial that was implemented, performance was significantly worse than when noise was turned off during subgoal testing.  This latter result may have occurred because penalizing all missed subgoals even when exploration noise is added may disincentivize a level from setting distant subgoals as these are more likely to be missed when a level uses a noisy policy.  When a level needs to set closer subgoals, the level needs to learn a longer sequence of subgoal actions, which can slow learning.      \n\n\nR3 - Is it necessary to use the same value for the policy limit parameter H (\u201cT\u201d in initial draft) for each level?\n\nNo, the policy limit parameter for each level can be set to whichever value the user prefers.  We designed HAC to use a single value for H for two reasons.  First, using different values of H for each level may hurt the ability of agents to equitably divide the task amongst its levels.  Different values for H will mean that one level needs to learn a longer sequence than the others, and learning may slow if this difference is large.  Second, a single value for all levels limits the number of hyperparameters that need to be set by the user.  \n\n\nR1 - What if the goals are unknown?\n\nWe assume the scenario in which the agent is given a set of goal states to learn to achieve.  However, this set of goal states can include all possible goal states so the designer is not required to specify a particular set of goals.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight", "abstract": "Hierarchical agents have the potential to solve sequential decision making tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions.

Consider the situation in which a two-level agent is in state A with a task goal of state C.  The higher-level proposes state B as a subgoal, but in less than T low-level actions, the agent does end up achieving the goal state C.  Due to its strategy of replacing the original subgoal action with the subgoal state that was achieved, the higher level within the HAC agent would receive the transition [state = A, subgoal action = C, reward = 0, next state = C, goal = C].  In other words, the upper level within HAC would replay the episode as if it had originally proposed state C as the subgoal.  On the other hand, HIRO\u2019s off-policy correction strategy chooses the action component in the higher level transition to be the subgoal state that would most likely cause the sequence of (state, action) tuples that occurred at the lower level when the low-level policy was trying to achieve the original subgoal state B.  In the example above, this will most likely be state B or some other state that is not state C.  Thus, the higher level HIRO agent will likely receive the transition [state = A, subgoal action = B, reward = cumulative low level reward, next state = C, goal = C].  We believe that using state B or some other state that is not state C as the subgoal action component is a critical error because this transition likely will not be valid in the future, while the transition passed to HAC likely will.  As the lower level continues to improve, at some point proposing subgoal state B will not result in the agent ending in state C.  This renders the update HIRO made obsolete.  At the same time, the lower level policy should be able to learn to move the agent from state A to at least close to state C.  When this occurs and HIRO again needs to decide on which subgoal state action to choose for the above high-level transition, it is likely that it will choose state C as the subgoal that would most likely cause the low-level (state, action) tuples that previously occurred given the current low level policy.  The higher level in HIRO would then make a similar update to the one that the higher level within HAC made possibly much earlier in training.   \n\nThe main result here is that because HAC agents replace the original subgoal with the actual subgoal state achieved, HAC agents can learn all policies within the hierarchy in parallel.  On the other hand, HIRO may need to wait for the policy at one level to converge before it can accurately train the policy at the next higher level, which should cause HIRO to learn more slowly than HAC.  This also has important consequences for adding more levels to the hierarchy.  Because HAC learns all policies in parallel, adding more levels can be helpful as it can shorten the sequence of actions that each level needs to learn.  However, when one policy is learned at a time as in HIRO, there is less of a benefit to inserting additional levels into the hierarchy. \n\n\n[1]  O. Nachum, S. Gu, H. Lee, and S.

In this note, we would like to provide an update on the hierarchical RL comparison we have implemented.  We will post a separate comment shortly addressing the other questions and concerns the reviewers and anonymous reviewer had.\n\nWe have completed a comparison to the algorithm HIRO (HIerarchical Reinforcement learning with Off-policy correction)[1].  We chose to compare to HIRO because (i) the algorithm has been peer-reviewed as it was recently accepted to the NeurIPS (NIPS) 2018 conference and (ii) the method has proven that it can outperform the other leading hierarchical RL algorithms that work in continuous state and action spaces: FuN (FeUdal Networks)[2] and Option-Critic[3].  The paper introducing HIRO is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08296.\n\nWe compared the two-level version of our approach, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), to HIRO, which by design has two levels, on both the relatively easy inverted pendulum task and the relatively more difficult UR5 reacher task.  In both tasks, the two-level version of HAC outperforms HIRO.  The outperformance is particularly substantial in the UR5 reacher task as HIRO is unable to maintain a goal achievement success rate > 0%, while the two-level version of HAC can achieve a 90+% success rate in around 900 episodes.  We will provide these performance comparison charts in the revised paper.\n\nBelow we discuss two key differences between the algorithms that we believe enable HAC to outperform HIRO.  We will explain the remaining key differences in the revised paper.  \n\nThe first significant difference between the algorithms is that HIRO does not use Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)[4] at the upper level of the hierarchy.  HIRO also does not use HER at the lower level and instead uses a distance-based reward function.  The data augmentation technique HER is critical because it helps the upper-level Universal Value Function Approximator (UVFA)[5] learn about the (state, action, goal) tuples that should have high Q-values.  In other words, HER helps the higher-level UVFA learn about the helpful subgoal actions that can move the agent from the current state to goals throughout the goal space.  This is important because the UVFA can then attempt to transfer these high Q-values to the subgoal actions that are relevant for achieving the higher level\u2019s current set of task goals.  HER is particularly important for relatively difficult tasks, such as UR5 Reacher, in which it is unlikely that the goal can be achieved with a random policy.  Without HER in these situations, because the sparse reward is rarely achieved and because there are no high Q-values to transfer, the UVFA will likely be unable to assign high Q-values to the subgoal actions that can solve the task, which should slow down learning.\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight", "abstract": "Hierarchical agents have the potential to solve sequential decision making tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions.

Each level of the hierarchy is rewarded for reaching a goal state. The top level's goal state is the environment goal, lower level goals states are the actions of the higher levels. The lowest level's actions are primitive actions. Each level can act until it reaches it goal or a maximum of T steps. Then HER is used to still learn from missed subgoals. For example, if the lowest level is given a subgoal and fails to achieve it, it is trained with a new experience where the goal was the achieved state. In addition, the level above is trained with an experience where the action it chose (the subgoal that was not achieved) is replaced with the subgoal that was achieved. So HER is replacing goals on one level and replacing actions on the higher level. The paper shows nice empirical results across 6 domains.\n\nThe two main differences from prior work are:\n1. Explicit constraint on how long the policies at each level can be.\n2. Use of HER in a novel way (on goals and actions) to learn from failed attempts at reaching subgoals from lower levels.\n\nThe use of HER in this work is really powerful and everything fits together nicely to make it work.\n\nThe only un-satisfying part of the algorithm is the need for a subgoal testing phase. Some actions are randomly decided to be testing phases, where all exploration is turned off at lower levels and the agent at the level selecting that subgoal is given negative reward if the subgoal is not achieved. This feels a bit unnatural to me. Does it not work if you punish a level for selecting a failed subgoal even if exploration is on? Does this phase unnecessarily punish levels for selecting subgoals that aren't reached early in learning, where even with no exploration a lower level may not have learned to reach the subgoal yet?\n\nThe main drawback of the paper is that there is no empirical comparison to related work. Instead the approach is only compared to doing learning with no hierarchy. Still, in all 6 domains, there is a clear improvement to using the hierarchy vs a flat hierarchy. \n\nPros:\n- Nice approach for hierarchical deep RL\n- Great use of HER to improve subgoal learning\n- Good empirical results showing benefit of approach over flat learning\nCons:\n- No empirical comparison to related work\n- Subgoal testing phase seems a bit hacky.\n", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper886/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight", "abstract": "Hierarchical agents have the potential to solve sequential decision making tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions.

The proposed method is a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that can use policy hierarchies with an arbitrary number of levels. To improve the sample efficiency in the learning process, the authors proposed to apply the hindsight experience replay mechanism at each level. Also, in order to avoid the actor function to output an unrealistic subgoal, the authors proposed the subgoal testing technique. \n\nThe proposed framework is interesting. And the example in Section 3.5 clearly demonstrate how this framework works. The authors proposed to solve a UMDP by solving a hierarchy of k UMDPs, where k is a hyperparameter. Each level (except for the bottom most level) will output subgoal states for the next level to achieve. This hierarchy is reasonable and easy to understand. However, from the definition on Page 3, it seems that all of the intermediate levels i (the case where 0 < i < k - 1) has the same state and action spaces. They are all equal to the state set of the original UMDP. Under this setting, will adding more intermediate levels help improve the performance a lot? We only see results with at most one intermediate level in the experiment. It will be better if the authors can show results on more levels (i.e. at least 4 levels in total). \n\nMoreover, the proposed framework has a policy limit parameter T, meaning that we only consider if a goal can be achieved within T steps or not, at each level. Is this parameter necessary to be the same for all levels? Also, it will be better if the author can show some results on the performances of the proposed method according to different values for T. The authors also proposed the subgoal testing technique. It is also better if the authors can show some performance comparisons on the cases with and without this technique.\n\nThe authors claimed that their method has the advantage over some existing HRL methods (e.g. the Option-Critic Architecture [1]) that their method can use policy hierarchies with an arbitrary number of levels while these methods can only use policy hierarchies with two levels. In the experiments, the authors also showed that, in some of their experiments, the 3-layer agent (with 2 subgoal layers) outperforms the 2-layer agent (with 1 subgoal layer), under their framework. However, the authors did not compare their 2-layer agent's performance with these existing HRL methods, which means that we do not know if their 3-layer agent's performance is better than that of some of the existing 2-layer agent methods. In addition to that, as I mentioned before, it is better if the authors can show experiment results on more levels (e.g. 4 levels and more) to show that their method can perform well in practice for policy hierarchies with many levels.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Pierre-Luc Bacon, Jean Harb, and Doina Precup.
