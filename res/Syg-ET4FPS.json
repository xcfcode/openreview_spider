The algorithm works by maintaining a probability distribution over the chance player / reward pair (i.e. an environment model).\n\nI give a weak recommendation to accept the paper. Although I haven't checked the proofs in detail, the premise seems to be sound - the authors extend model-based exploration results from MDPs to games. The essence of the argument seems to be that the model of the chance player becomes close to d^\\star quickly enough to get a sub-linear bound.\n\nThe main complaints I have about the paper concern clarity.\n\n1. The paper is very densely written. This isn't necessarily bad, but it makes the paper a bit hard to understand. It would benefit the manuscript greatly to provide a figure which shows how the algorithm works for a small toy game. There is space left in the paper, so even a one-page figure would fit in. The figure should show all the major quantities: d, \\sigma, u.\n\n2. The meaning of the quantity \\mathcal{G}_T^i should be more thoroughly described, given it is important in the proof. \n\n3. You define a game with N players, but the algorithm works with 2.\n\n4. Do you really need all the notations in section 2.1? Why not just define the ones used in the algorithm?\n\n5. Can you discuss how large the constants \\xi can become in practice? The definition of \\xi^i seems to be different on page 10 and in Theorem 1 - please disambiguate.\n\nI ask the authors to add a figure and address the issues above. \n\nI am not an expert in this sub-field so I may have missed aspects of the paper.\n\nMinor points:\n- In Figure 1, please say that \"default\" is your algorithm.\n- \"optimal in the face of uncertainty\" => \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" ", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper476/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper476/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Posterior sampling for multi-agent reinforcement learning: solving extensive games with imperfect information", "authors": ["Yichi Zhou", "Jialian Li", "Jun Zhu"], "authorids": ["vofhqn@gmail.com", "lijialia16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszj@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) is a useful framework for making decisions in an unknown environment.

Then, CFR is applied in the inner loop; but instead of finding the NE strategy, one player finds the strategy that basically maximizes the reward deviation between two games sampled from the posterior, given that the opponent is playing Nash in the first game.\n\nThe authors prove convergence bounds for their algorithm, and demonstrate its performance on Leduc Hold'em with game parameters randomly chosen from a Dirichlet distribution.\n\n-------------------------\n\nI agree with the authors that standard CFR suffers from the requirement that the full game is known, so it doesn't work well in its standard form when the environment is not known. There *are* other regret minimizers that do work in the model-free setting ([1], [2], [3]), none of which are discussed by the authors.\n\nI also find the proposed setting somewhat unconvincing. The authors are considering a situation where the environment is unknown, but it's not the RL setting because you still must control both (opposing!) agents. Of course, you can't actually find a Nash Equilibrium if you can't control the other player (because they might just never explore part of the game tree). But you would want your algorithm to be a regret minimizer regardless of your partner's strategy. Is this true of the proposed algorithm?\n\nThe proposed interaction strategy described in Eq. 5 and 6 is clever: basically, each player explores a part of the tree that maximizes the difference in payoffs between the two sampled games. This seems a bit inefficient thouggh, why doesn't the agent just find the BR to \\sigma_{-i} under \\tilde{d} given that the opponent plays the NE under d? I don't see why you would want to explore parameters that have a high reward uncertainty if there's a different strategy that does better than the whole confidence interval. It's like UCB: you should play a strategy not with the highest uncertainty, but with the highest optimistic payoff.\n\nI think the work could be substantially improved by comparing against model-free baselines, e.g. fictitious self-play [2], CFR with outcome sampling [1]. The current work deosn't provide any evidence of what benefits the Bayesian approach provides over model-free regret minimization. Especially since the Bayesian approach presumably does not scale as well due to the requirement of maintaining beliefs over all possible games, and the requirement that a correct prior is provided. I would be curious to see Bayesian and model-free appraoches compared in games of different sizes to see how the different methods scale.\n\nNits:\n- such as the private pokers in poker games (private cards)\n- h_1, h_1 \\in H^C, are independent\n- The reference to Neil 2018 should be \"Neil Burch\", not \"Burch Neil\"\n- And if you're going to say \"we can directly apply the technique from [100-page PhD thesis]\", please mention the page number.\n\n\n\n[1] Lanctot, Marc, et al. \"Monte Carlo sampling for regret minimization in extensive games.\"\u00a0Advances in neural information processing systems. 2009.\n[2] Heinrich, Johannes, Marc Lanctot, and David Silver. \"Fictitious self-play in extensive-form games.\"\u00a0International Conference on Machine Learning. 2015.\n[3] Srinivasan, Sriram, et al. \"Actor-critic policy optimization in partially observable multiagent environments.\"\u00a0Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018.\n\n\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I assessed the sensibility of the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper476/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper476/AnonReviewer2"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Posterior sampling for multi-agent reinforcement learning: solving extensive games with imperfect information", "authors": ["Yichi Zhou", "Jialian Li", "Jun Zhu"], "authorids": ["vofhqn@gmail.com", "lijialia16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszj@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) is a useful framework for making decisions in an unknown environment.

So the target of the interaction strategy is to *fix the bias*. More formally, the \u201cbias\u201d can be described by the term \\mathcal{G}_T^i, and we proved that our interaction strategy can make sure \\mathcal{G}_T^i decrease in a speed of O(\\sqrt{\\log T/ T}). That\u2019s why we design the interaction strategy in this way.\n\nThen, as for your comment \u201cyou should play a strategy not with the highest uncertainty, but with the highest optimistic payoff\u201d, what you said is true in the setting of single agent reinforcement learning just like UCB as you commented. However, playing strategies with a high optimistic payoff may not be efficient in the setting of multi-agent reinforcement learning: if \\sigma^{-i} is not a good strategy for the opponent, then playing (BR(\\sigma^{-i}), \\sigma^{-i}) may provide little information about the Nash where BR(\\sigma^{-i}) is the best response of \\sigma^{-i} under \\tilde{d}_t, though player i can receive more payoffs in the simulation. And in our algorithm, \\sigma_t^{-i}_t is not Nash. Instead, it is generated by CFR with a biased knowledge. Thus, \\sigma_t^{-i} may not be a good strategy. \n\nAccording to the reason above, we failed to establish any theoretical connection between (BR(\\sigma^{-i}_t), \\sigma^{-i}_t) and the exploitability.

Below, we address your concerns starting with a potential misunderstanding.\n\nQ1: A potential misunderstanding: \nYou commented that \u201cgiven that the opponent is playing Nash in the first game\u201d. But this is not a correct description of our algorithm. Actually, the opponent is playing the strategy generated by CFR in the last round, i.e., \\sigma^{-i}_t, instead of the average strategy (the approximate Nash). We have polished our description on the interaction strategy in Sec.3 to make it clearer.\n\nQ2: On the regret minimizers in the model-free setting and missing baselines:\nThanks for the kind suggestion. We agree that it is very valuable to compare our method with Fictitious self-play (FSP) [3] and MCCFR with outcome sampling (MCCFR-OS) [2]. We have included them and added comparison in the revision.\n\nIn fact, we have already discussed the FSP in Sec. 4 and evaluated our algorithm against FSP-PSRL in the first submission, and our algorithm shows a better convergence rate (See Sec. 5, Fig. 2). We have added FSP-Fitted-Q using the same hyperparameters as reported in [3], as a new baseline method in Sec.5. And FSP-Fitted-Q converges much slower than FSP-PSRL. Also, we have added the discussion on MCCFR-OS in Sec. 4 and done additional experiments on MCCFR-OS in Sec. 5 of the revision. In our implementation of MCCFR-OS, we use epsilon-greedy to do exploration as suggested in [2]. We set epsilon=0.1. The performances of FSP-Fitted-Q and MCCFR-OS are very poor compared with other algorithms. This may be because (1) a model-free algorithm is very unusual to outperform model-based methods in terms of sample complexity on tabular RL tasks (Please refer to [4], Sec.4.5 of [5] for some related results); (2) they don\u2019t have efficient exploration strategies: but to the best of our knowledge, there exists few principled ways to do exploration efficiently in MARL even on tabular tasks. And developing a method, which is efficient at least in theory, to do exploration is exactly the motivation of our work. \n\nAs for another related work [6] you mentioned, we have included it in the related work. We didn\u2019t include it as a baseline method since we concentrate on the tabular-based methods to compare their exploration efficiency. The use of functional approximators in [6] involves extra learning error and the comparison is less significant.\n\nQ3: About the proposed setting:\nThanks. Indeed, controlling both agents is not reasonable if you are using the trained strategy to play with an opponent which you cannot control. But controlling both agents in training is very standard and widely used. Previous work on Markov games under the RL setting [1] (which is a general setting in MARL) also assumes both agents to be controlled by one algorithm in the training phase to make sure that the generated strategy approaches the Nash Equilibrium. This setting is also used in the fictitious self-play and MCCFR with outcome sampling that you mentioned. In Sec.2 of the revision, we have refined our description for the setting.\n "}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper476/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper476/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Posterior sampling for multi-agent reinforcement learning: solving extensive games with imperfect information", "authors": ["Yichi Zhou", "Jialian Li", "Jun Zhu"], "authorids": ["vofhqn@gmail.com", "lijialia16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn", "dcszj@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"], "keywords": [], "abstract": "Posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) is a useful framework for making decisions in an unknown environment.

We have revised Section 2 to make it clear that our focus is on two-player zeros-sum games;\nwe start with the extensive game with N players so as to provide a general definition and introduce related notations, which subsumes TZIEG as nontrivial special cases.\n\nQ4: Unnecessary notations:\nThanks. We have checked the notations carefully and removed unnecessary ones. \n\nQ5: Constants \\xi:\nConstants \\xi are parameters related to the structure of the game. Our definition of \\xi is from Corrollary 2 in [1]. Generally, we have the lower and upper bounds for \\xi as: sqrt{|\\mathcal{I}|} \\leq \\xi \\leq |\\mathcal{I}|. In most games, \\xi is much smaller than |\\mathcal{I}|, e.g., in No limit Texas Hold, \\xi is about 10000 as shown in [1] while the size of the game tree is more than 10^13.

PSRL is really an application of Thompson sampling principle, but it is important that it doesn't happen every step but instead on a longer timescale. It might be helpful to cite \"a tutorial on thompson sampling\" Russo et al.\n- Do you think there are promising avenues towards PSRL with generalization (rather than tabular)?
