The authors pick a few example words and provide a detailed analysis. This is useful to understand how the test perplexity varies with #training examples for these individual settings. However, it is hardly enough to draw conclusion about the general applicability of the technique or effectiveness of the results. Why were these specific words chosen? If the reason is due to some statistical property (e.g., frequency) observed in the corpus, then why not generalize this idea and demonstrate empirical results for a class of words exhibiting the property. Such an analysis would be useful to understand the effectiveness of the overall approach. Another idea would be to use the one/few-shot learning to learn embeddings and evaluate their quality on a semantic task (as suggested in Section 3.3), but on a larger scale.\n\nThe technical contributions are also not novel.

Based on this idea, this work tries to obtain a better understanding of words in the one-shot or few-shot setting by leveraging surrounding word. They do this by language modeling sentences which contain rarely seen or never seen words. They evaluated their model using percent change in perplexity on test sentences containing new word by varying the number of training sentences containing this word. 3 Proposed Methods to model few-shot words: (1) beginning with random embedding, (2) beginning with zero embedding (3) beginning with the centroid of other words in the sentence. They compare to 2 Baseline Methods: (1) centroid of other words in the sentence, and (2) full training including the sparse words. Their results show that learning from centroids of other words can outperform full training on the new words. \n\nExplanation\nThe paper is well written, and the experiments are well explained.  It is an interesting paper, and a research topic which is not well studied. The experiments are reasonable. The method seems to work well. \n\nHowever, the method provides a very marginal difference between the previous method in Lazaridou et al. (2017). They just use backdrop to learn from this starting position. The main contribution of this work is the evaluation section. \n\nWhy only use the PTB language modeling task. Why not use the task in Gauthier & Mordatch or Hermann et al. The one task of language modeling shows promising results, but it\u2019s not totally convincing. \n\nOne of the biggest caveats is that the experiments are only done in a few words. I\u2019m not sure why more couldn\u2019t have been done. This is discussed in section 4.1, but I think some of these differences could have been alleviated if there were more experiments done. Regardless, the experiments on the 8 words that they did chose were well done. \n\nI don\u2019t think that section 3.3 (embedding similarity) is particularly useful. \n", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "writers": [], "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": true, "forumContent": {"title": "One-shot and few-shot learning of word embeddings", "abstract": "Standard deep learning systems require thousands or millions of examples to learn a concept, and cannot integrate new concepts easily.

Briefly, we made this choice initially a) to allow us to explore the variation among different training sentences and different numbers of training sentences for the same word in more detail, and b) because our original experiments required training a new language model from scratch for each new word, which meant running many new words would require thousands of hours of compute time. However, it is useful to evaluate our approach across many words, and so we have added an experiment to the paper which does so while still maintaining computational feasibility.\n\nIn this experiment, we selected 100 of the ~150 words that appear exactly 20 times in the PTB train corpus (omitting the words we used in prior experiments). Instead of training separate models without each word as we had previously, we trained a single model with NONE of these words. We then tested our one-shot learning technique and the centroid technique on these sentences, and compared to results obtained from ``full training with all words'' -- a model trained with the train sentences for each of the hundred words and the rest of the PTB training corpus. Notice that this comparison is not as precise as the earlier ones -- the ``full training with all words'' model receives about 2.5% more training data over all than any of the one-shot learning models, which means it will both perform better even on other words and will thus have more relevant linguistic structure to learn the new words from. Nevertheless, the comparisons between our technique and the centroid technique are still valid, and the comparison to the full training with all words gives a *worst-case* bound on how poorly one-shot methods will do compared to full training. In these experiments, we saw that our method performed both relatively consistently across different words, and performed consistently better than the centroid method.

We had not encountered this work previously, and we agree that they share some similar features and will reference it in our final version of the paper.

This is important, because in practice when a sentence containing a new word is encountered, it is unlikely to conveniently be a definition of that word.\n\n* Furthermore, the only metric on which their approach shows improvement is the similarity of the produced embeddings to the \"true\" embedding. This may or may not be meaningful, since our representational similarity analyses suggest that there are dissimilar word embeddings that nevertheless produce similar performance in a complex task.\n\n* We demonstrate behaviorally relevant improvements (that is, our model's ability to do its task in the context of the new word improves).  We view this as an important part of exploring whether the representation learned is actually of real use in a language processing task.\n\n* Finally, we conducted more detailed analyses of the behavior and errors produced by our approach, such as the impact on prediction of other words and how this is affected by replay.

For instance, from just hearing a word used in a sentence, humans can infer a great deal about it, by leveraging what the syntax and semantics of the surrounding words tells us. Here, we draw inspiration from this to highlight a simple technique by which deep recurrent networks can similarly exploit their prior knowledge to learn a useful representation for a new word from little data. This could make natural language processing systems much more flexible, by allowing them to learn continually from the new words they encounter.", "pdf": "/pdf/c9ade40c8f59a1058b5d9f15b7ef14eed2a4bf09.pdf", "TL;DR": "We highlight a technique by which natural language processing systems can learn a new word from context, allowing them to be much more flexible.", "paperhash": "lampinen|oneshot_and_fewshot_learning_of_word_embeddings", "_bibtex": "@misc{\nkyle2018oneshot,\ntitle={One-shot and few-shot learning of word embeddings},\nauthor={Andrew Kyle Lampinen and James Lloyd McClelland},\nyear={2018},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkYgAJWCZ},\n}", "keywords": ["One-shot learning", "embeddings", "word embeddings", "natural language processing", "NLP"], "authors": ["Andrew Kyle Lampinen", "James Lloyd McClelland"], "authorids": ["lampinen@stanford.edu", "mcclelland@stanford.edu"]}, "tags": [], "invitation": {"rdate": null, "duedate": null, "tddate": null, "ddate": null, "multiReply": null, "taskCompletionCount": null, "tmdate": 1512791684658, "id": "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/-/Paper532/Public_Comment", "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference"], "readers": ["everyone"], "invitees": ["~"], "reply": {"replyto": null, "forum": "rkYgAJWCZ", "writers": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)"}, "signatures": {"values-regex": "~.*|\\(anonymous\\)", "description": "How your identity will be displayed with the above content."}, "readers": {"description": "The users who will be allowed to read the above content.", "value-dropdown": ["everyone", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Authors_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Reviewers_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Area_Chairs_and_Higher", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Program_Chairs"]}, "content": {"title": {"required": true, "order": 0, "description": "Brief summary of your comment.", "value-regex": ".{1,500}"}, "comment": {"required": true, "order": 1, "description": "Your comment or reply (max 5000 characters).", "value-regex": "[\\S\\s]{1,5000}"}}}, "nonreaders": [], "noninvitees": ["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper532/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper532/Reviewers", "ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper532/Area_Chair"], "cdate": 1512791684658}}}], "count": 11}
