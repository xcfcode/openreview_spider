The dataset is collected from the X-Plane simulation environment and consists of 8011 landings, each landing consists of time series data from 1090 sensors. Their evaluation metric is a combination of disentanglement score, regression tasks, and failure classification. The authors test a combination of baseline models from basic autoencoders to dynamic actions-aware encoders. The writing is generally clear but I have doubts about the proposed evaluation metrics, experiments, and significance of the dataset (details below).\n\nStrengths:\n1. The task seems to be novel and complex. The authors have done a good job of collecting the dataset and ensuring that the data is clean and comprehensive.\n2. The authors have performed a comprehensive job of evaluating the combinations of baseline models for their proposed task.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Table 4 on evaluation results, while comprehensive, lacks some explanation. The issue with MSE is that it is hard to interpret what these values mean. Specifically, how difficult is this task? How well can a human perform on this task? How well are the baselines doing relative to human-level performance, and is there room for improvement? The answers to these questions are important towards whether this new dataset will be a strong benchmark for representation learning.\n2. There is less novelty in terms of the models presented for evaluation since they are composed of existing models. What are some state-of-the-art models for similar tasks, and do they constitute fair comparison?\n\nQuestions to authors:\n1. Refer to weakness points 1 and 2.\n2. What biases do you think might exist in the dataset during the collection process? How might these biases affect what the models learn, and how can they be mitigated?\n3. How do you ensure that all sensors are active at all times and that all sensors provide useful information for predicting the label? Are there cases where the multisensor data is noisy in certain modalities or missing in other modalities? If so, what are some models that can remain robustness to noisy or missing modalities?\n4. Why do you think disentangled representations will help? Sure, they have been generally shown to help learn more interpretable representations, and help in flexible generation from disentangled factors. But in terms of discriminative or generative performance on your newly proposed dataset, does learning disentangled representations help? What are some models that can learn effectively learn such disentangled representations?\n\nPresentation improvements, typos, edits, style, missing references:\nSection 3, line 7, 'with with a frequency' -> 'with'\nI would suggest referring to some recent work on multimodal temporal fusion, such as \"Memory Fusion Network for Multi-view Sequential Learning.

The issue with MSE is that it is hard to\n> interpret what these values mean. Specifically, how difficult is this task? How well can a human perform on this\n> task?\n\nWe include the MEAN baseline for that purpose. It is difficult to make a fair comparison with human performance on these tasks since normally a human pilot will have access to full information on some factors from the cockpit (such as wind) or can reason about other factors from experience (unavailable in the training set) and better predict the state at time moment t+k. In this sense, our benchmarks measure a model's ability to catch the hidden factors from the observations. \n\nIn the paper, we have added a clarification on the MEAN baseline: \n\u201cTo establish a simple baseline for our models we use the mean target value over the training set as a prediction. In Table 4, the ``MEAN baseline'' row shows the absolute MSE values for MEAN and the other rows are normalized to the MEAN baseline.\u201d\n\n> There is less novelty in terms of the models presented for evaluation since they are composed of existing models.\n> What are some state-of-the-art models for similar tasks, and do they constitute fair comparison?\n\nThere are not too many models currently available for multimodal temporal data. We have implemented and compared two state of the art models:\n-- Decouple Dynamics (Zhang et al., 2018; arXiv:1804.10689) proposes the method to explicitly extract embeddings from temporal data and then train a RL agent on such representations;\n-- Multimodal Temporal Encoder (Yang et al., 2017; arXiv:1704.03152) proposes an encoder specifically designed for multimodal temporal data (originally for video and audio streams).\n\nHowever, as the evaluation table (Table 4) shows, these models are not necessarily the best for any given task..\n\n> What biases do you think might exist in the dataset during the collection process? How might these biases affect\n> what the models learn, and how can they be mitigated?\n\nWe use the same aircraft and the same valid landing settings, which in particular means that the initial weight of the aircraft is the same and changes only as the fuel gets burned. This can be used to compute the flight altitude and distance to start point. A change in the initial weight might influence the representation quality, and to avoid it we varied the starting location of the aircraft (so that the weight would be different by the time landing begins). Also, for an incorrect landing (crash) into the forest or the city, the airplane does not stop but keeps moving through objects until simulation is over; this is a feature of X-Plane, but in our experiments it has not made a difference for learning representations.\n\nGenerally, we have tried to avoid potential biases by adding a large number of airports and runways.\n \n\n> How do you ensure that all sensors are active at all times and that all sensors provide useful information for\n> predicting the label? Are there cases where the multisensor data is noisy in certain modalities or missing in other\n> modalities? If so, what are some models that can remain robustness to noisy or missing modalities?\n\nWe have selected the most highly variable sensors, excluding the dead ones (the ones that do not change during the flight). We have also ensured that the factors we predict in benchmarks are related to sensor readings. Actually, all benchmarking factors affect plane dynamics that can be (theoretically speaking) estimated from the provided time series. We do not model sensor faults, modeling of sensor noise is left to the X-Plane simulator, and normally the sensors work without any interruptions in the simulation.\n\nIn future work, we plan to investigate the stability of different models to missing modalities or suddently increased noise in some sensors.\n\n\n> Why do you think disentangled representations will help? Sure, they have been generally shown to help learn more\n> interpretable representations, and help in flexible generation from disentangled factors. \n\nIn machine learning, disentanglement of different factors in a representation is generally useful when (1) there are many different tasks the latent representation might serve for, (2) some of these tasks are not known in advance, and (3) there is a need to understand and/or present to the user the underlying factors behind a decision; see, e.g., (Bengio et al., 2014, arXiv:1206.5538; Chen et al., 2016, arXiv:1606.03657). All three factors are present in our case: we present a wide set of tasks in the paper already, and the ultimate purpose would be to use the resulting representations for control purposes, i.e., for tasks that are not well defined in advance at all.\n\n\n> Presentation improvements, typos, edits, style, missing references:\n\nFixed and added, thank you!\n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper974/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper974/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper974/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Learning State Representations in Complex Systems with Multimodal Data", "abstract": "Representation learning becomes especially important for complex systems with multimodal data sources such as cameras or sensors.

Releasing this dataset as a benchmark for comparing representation learning algorithms can potentially impact the community greatly;\n2. The authors combined several existing work on measuring representation learning algorithms and proposed an evaluation framework to evaluate the quality of learned representation using supervised learning tasks and disentanglement scores;\n3. The authors implemented an extended list of representation learning algorithms and compared them on the dataset;\n\ncons:\n1. the paper lacks clarification and guideline to convince the readers of the usefulness of the dataset and the evaluation framework. The authors spent almost half of the space explaining different existing representation learning algorithms. A more convincing story would be to find a few well-established representation learning algorithms to corroborate on the reliability of the dataset and the evaluation metrics;\n2. More details should be put into describing the dataset. It is not clear why this dataset is particularly suited for evaluating representation learning in the context of reinforcement learning. Do the authors have insight on the difficulty of the task? While having multi-modality is appreciated, it might worth thinking a separate dataset focusing on a single modality, e.g., image;\n3.  Given that the authors designed the dataset for evaluating representation learning for reinforcement learning, it is worth evaluating these algorithms on solving the main task using some standard RL techniques on top of the learned representations.\n4.
