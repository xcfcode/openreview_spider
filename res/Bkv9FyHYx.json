The authors also consider issues of temporal evolution in the ratings, beating competitive baselines like TimeSVD++.\n\nNegatively, it's not clear whether LSTMs are really beneficial here over \"traditional\" rating+text methods. No quantitative comparison to another rating+text method is provided, though many are discussed. Text prediction is discussed in terms of perplexity, but again this is not quantitatively or qualitatively compared to alternatives.\n\nOverall though, I think the paper is worth accepting due to the overall promise of the idea, even if the experiments are not quite convincing yet.", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "nonreaders": [], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"TL;DR": "", "title": "Joint Training of Ratings and Reviews with Recurrent Recommender Networks", "abstract": "Accurate modeling of ratings and text reviews is at the core of successful recommender systems.
