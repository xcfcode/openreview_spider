It achieves this by employing neural architecture search (NAS) on top of reinforcement learning. Their main contribution is a \u201cflexible and safe\u201d search space; experiments are carried out on CIFAR-10 and -100. Standard performance results are augmented by diagnostic studies.\n\nThis paper received a total of five reviews which, remarkably, yielded the same assessment: the paper had merits but was marginally below the acceptance threshold. In general, the reviewers thought the idea was interesting and straightforward, experiments extensive and the paper was clearly written. The primary concerns brought up were novelty (i.e. just cGAN + NAS?, R1 and R2), minimal performance gain (R4, R5), unclear motivation (R2), lack of comparisons --- including to other NAS for GAN methods --- (R1,R3), limited to low-resolution datasets (R2,R3), no reporting of time or space complexity (R1,R3), unclear where improvement comes from --- no control for capacity --- (R5). \n\nOn the point about comparing to NAS + GAN works, the authors responded, stating that the NAS + GAN methods brought up by the reviewer were unconditional GAN methods and pointed out that they made unconditional GAN comparisons in the Appendix.\n\nThe authors also emphasized to multiple reviewers that the point of the paper was not to improve NAS. Interestingly, they also made a comment to R5 that the point of the paper was not to improve performance of cGANs, but to improve understanding of them.\t\n\nThe reviewers are unanimous in that this paper falls just below the bar for the reasons outlined above. Following the discussion phase, I see no reason to overturn their recommendation. I hope that the authors can use the feedback from these reviews to improve this paper and re-submit it."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Program_Chairs"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Searching towards Class-Aware Generators for Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks", "authorids": ["~Peng_Zhou2", "~Lingxi_Xie1", "~XIAOPENG_ZHANG7", "~Bingbing_Ni3", "~Qi_Tian3"], "authors": ["Peng Zhou", "Lingxi Xie", "XIAOPENG ZHANG", "Bingbing Ni", "Qi Tian"], "keywords": ["NAS", "cGAN"], "abstract": "Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) were designed to generate images based on the provided conditions, e.g., class-level distributions.

For example, the SPADE\u2018s discriminator only judges whether the input image is real or fake. Besides, I think simply concatenating semantic mask with input cannot make the generator and discriminator of cGANs fully cooperate. A possible improvement scheme, I think, is that we can design class embedding (namely, learnable parameters) for the generator, and then use a classification-based loss for the discriminator such as Multi-hinge loss [1]. In this way, the discriminator and generator will fully cooperate. \nLooking forward to your reply\uff01\n\n[1]I. Kavalerov, W. Czaja, and R.

In fact, the current RL-based search algorithms for GAN are limited to only search the generator network architecture but not the discriminator network architecture. The reason is that for the current weight-sharing RL-based NAS method, it is difficult for us to get a metric to evaluate the quality of the discriminator during the searching process. For a sampled generator architecture, we can obtain its IS or FID, but for a sampled discriminator, we cannot get any valuable metrics. However, AdversarialNAS can search for the discriminator and generator at the same time because it is based on a differentiable search method.\n\n**The authors should add competing results from AdversarialNAS and AutoGAN. Specifically, the Intra FIDs on CIFAR10, FID, and IS scores on CIFAR100 of the two methods should be reported.**\n\nWe respectfully disagree with the reviewer. AdversarialNAS and AutoGAN are unconditional GANs. Let them be compared with NAS-caGAN (a conditional GAN) in terms of intra FID is not fair. In fact, we have provided the comparison results of NAS-GAN (an unconditional GAN model searched by our method) with AdversarialNAS and AutoGAN in the appendix (Table 11).\n\n**Training and testing times, as well as the consumed GPU resources.**\n\nThe search time is within two days using one GTX 1080ti GPU.

We like these architectures too. We provide our summary of the paper above. Please refer to it for common questions. Below are the responses to the specific comments\n\n**Clarify the difference between the CMConv and the modulated convolution in Karras et al [1].**\n\nThe only difference between CMConv and modulated convolution [1] is that CMConv uses learnable class embeddings as the input of modulated convolution, so that class information can be injected into the convolution kernel parameters. We will further clarify and emphasize this point in our paper.\n\n**Quantitative results in Table 2 seem not promising**\n\nTable 2 shows some results of cGANs on CIFAR100. NAS-caGAN is inferior than FQ-GAN and Multi-hinge GAN. We think the reason may be that NAS-caGAN did not utilize feature quantization [2] and multi-hinge loss [3] for the discriminator, which are effective to improve FID and IS respectively. However, we want to emphasize that the main contribution of this paper is not to achieve good performance on CIFAR, but that we use NAS to search for a distinct generator network architecture for each class. By analyzing all the class-aware generator architectures, we found some interesting rules for conditional GANs. To realize this idea, we have overcome many difficulties, including introducing CMConv for sharing data with ordinary convolution, multi-net NAS obtaining multiple network architectures through one search, and mixed-architecture optimization enabling training multiple class-aware generators easier. We sincerely hope that reviewers will not reject this paper just for reasons of performance.\n\n**List infra-FIDs of one existing unconditioned GAN method in the Table 1**\n\nWe answer the reason why we did not compare with unconditional GANs in Table 1. If we list the performance of unconditional GAN in Table 1, we are sure that some reviewers will criticize us for comparing conditional GAN with unconditional GAN. In order not to cause controversy, we think it is better not to list unconditional GANs in Table 1.\n\n**Have a table with quantitative results of IS/FID on CIFAR-10**\n\nThe reviewer might have overlooked some results.

We summarize the paper here and highlight findings that may be beneficial to the community.Then we clarify questions from every individual review.\n\n**What did we do?**\n\nWe design class-aware generators for conditional GANs. Although the idea seems straightforward, non-trivial technical efforts are required. We list these technologies as follows.\n\n* We use NAS to automatically design the generator network architecture for each class. In particular, we propose a multi-net NAS algorithm, which can obtain the generator network architectures of all classes through only one search.\n\n* Inspired by Karras et al. [1], we introduce a new operation named class-modulated convolution (CMConv). This operation allows the training data to be shared among different generator architectures and thus alleviates the issue of limited training data for each class.\n\n* We develop mixed-architecture optimization, such that multiple class-aware generators can be optimized at the same time. This allows us to easily apply the idea of class-aware generators to datasets with more classes such as CIFAR100 in the paper.\n\n**The core idea of this paper is to make the generator architecture be class-aware. Is it useful?**\n\nYes, we are sure that the class-aware idea is valuable. However, the value is not to boost performance, but to help us discover some key rules about cGANs. We emphasize two rules discovered by analyzing the class-aware generators. If we do not use class-aware generators, it is difficult for us to clearly discover these statistical rules.\n\n1. Coordination between the discriminator and the generator is important for cGANs. In particular, the unconditional discriminator leads to sparse use of conditional operators in the generator, while there will be more conditional operators in the generator when using the conditional discriminator (i.e., projection discriminator employed in the paper). This phenomenon was discovered by analyzing the searched class-aware generators. We emphasize that this discovery is beneficial to the community, and it can help us improve some of the existing GAN-based methods. For example, for image-to-image tasks, SPADE [2] used an unconditional GAN. If we want to improve the performance of SPADE, we first need to design a class conditional operator for the generator, and then let the discriminator also have an ability to distinguish categories. We think this is a direction worth trying because our paper has shown that the coordination between generators and discriminators is critical.\n\n2. The position of injecting class information into the generator is important for cGANs. Specifically, we find that the conditional operator is more likely to appear in the early stage (close to the input noise) of the generator. This rule is also discovered by analyzing the class-aware generators and is beneficial to the community. For example, when doing style transfer tasks, we must be careful in which layers to inject content information and in which layers to inject style information. Perhaps we are not the first to discover this phenomenon, but we verified this phenomenon by means of NAS and class-aware generators.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* We acknowledge that the performance of the current NAS-caGAN on CIFAR100 is ordinary compared to the current mainstream cGAN models (refer to Table 2 in the paper). However, the main purpose of class-aware is not to achieve state of the art, but to enable us to better understand the properties of cGANs by means of analyzing class-aware generators, so that we know what to focus on when using cGANs.\n\n* There are no high-resolution experiments. The experiment of using GANs to generate high-resolution images requires a lot of computing resources. Besides, it will become more complicated when combined with NAS. Therefore, currently we do not conduct high-resolution experiments. However, we believe that this does not affect the main contribution of this paper.\n\nAll in all, this paper has implemented a new idea, namely using class-aware generators for cGANs. Although the experiments are limited to CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, we found some interesting rules through analyzing the searched class-aware generators. This is the first work to realize the idea of class-aware generators, with non-trivial efforts. **Please do not reject this paper on the pretext of not achieving state of the art.** We believe that readers will get inspiration for cGANs from this paper. Finally, if you find the above comments to be useful and employ any of them in the future, please cite this paper. Thanks a lot!\n\n\n[1]T. Karras, S. Laine, M. Aittala, J. Hellsten, J.

The Class-Modulated Conv is proposed to condition the search space.", "review": "Pros:\nThis paper designs class-aware generators (increasing flexibility) for cGAN by RL-based neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. GAN models with better flexibility are promising to yield better performances.\n\nClass-Modulated convolution (CMconv) is designed to increase model flexibility while enabling data sharing among classes, increasing the efficiency of training data.\n\nMixed-architecture optimization is presented to ease the training procedure of multiple class-aware generators.\n\nCons:\n\nThe proposed Class-Modulated Conv also inserts the class embedding to a common convolution, which is similar to a regular BN. The architectures for different categories are still weight-sharing, which is quite a common approach in NAS. Thus, this work may be treated as applying NAS to cGAN.\n\nFor searching network for GANs, the main challenge lies in how to provide stable and efficient supervision as a reward. Note that during training, the generator (G) and discriminator (D) play as rivals. Searching for the architectures of G and choosing IS as a reward only helps the G compete against D. I wonder whether it is the optimal choice, so the authors need to consider the settings in [1], i.e., updating the architectures for both G and D.\n\nMany NAS algorithms for GAN models are relevant to this work, but none of them is evaluated against the proposed method in the experiments. I think the authors should add competing results from AdversarialNAS [1] and AutoGAN. Specifically, the Intra FIDs on CIFAR10, FID, and IS scores on CIFAR100 of the two methods should be reported.\n\nNeither time complexity nor space complexity is reported. Considering that the resolution of outputs is only 32$\\times$32, I wonder whether the proposed method is prohibitively expensive to be applied to practical applications that require higher resolution. Note that the resolution for most generation tasks is at least 256$\\times$256 or 128$\\times$128.

The authors design a Class-Modulated Convolution to allow for the weight-sharing among different searched architectures. The proposed NAS-caGAN outperforms the model that employs searched class-agnostic architecture on CIFAR 10 and achieves better results compared with cproj (Miyato & Koyama, 2018) on CIFAR 100. \n \n##########################################################################\n \nReasons for score: \n\nOverall, I vote for rejecting, but I am happy to modify the score if the authors could provide further details about my concerns. My major concerns are about the baseline choice, computational costs, and the evidence to support the method\u2019s utility (see cons below).  Hopefully the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period. \n \n##########################################################################\n \nPros: \n1. The idea of using an RL-based NAS to search for the optimal architecture of different categories is quite interesting and empirically demonstrates its superior effect when compared with the searched identical generator architecture regardless of the category class.\n2. Overall, the paper is well written and technically sound. \n3. Good ablation test that highlights the utility of the class-projection (cproj) discriminator over a standard GAN\u2019s discriminator.\n4. Good illustration of the proportion of different operators (i.e., RConv and CMConv) in each layer of the class-aware architecture.\n \n##########################################################################\n \nCons: \n1. The key concern about the paper is the lack of experiments to validate the utility of the proposed method compared with the previous work. Despite the paper asserting that the usefulness of searching for distinct architecture for different categories, the paper only compares the **searched** class-agnostic model (NAS-cGAN) with the proposed class-aware one (NAS-caGAN), and ignores the comparison with the literature on CIFAR 10, such as (Brock et al., 2018; Kavalerov et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020) .\n2.  Another concern is the baseline presented. \n(1) Most recent works such as (Kavalerov et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020) selected BigGAN (Brock et al., 2018) as their baseline. Considering the limited results (not achieving the state-of-the-art on neither of the presented metrics), a deeper analysis and performance comparison of the proposed framework would have been helpful to argue for its effectiveness. \n(2) It is interesting to inject CMConv operation at the first layer of BigGAN, which achieves a better result than other operator settings. Why not use BigGAN as the baseline?\n3. Could the authors provide the details about computational and **time** costs of the proposed method? How much time/resources would this method take to search?  \n4. In the Sec.4.1, the paper claims that this method could benefit other works. Considering the lack of convincing experiments to support this argument, it is doubtful about its correctness.\n5. For the \u201cmoving average\u201d, it would be better to provide more details about it. The paper claims the usage of it for training stability, but never mentions the details about it, which seems not very clear to me.\n6. In the Sec.2, it would have been nice to supplement the details compared with the recent literature of GANs with NAS.\n \n#########################################################################\n \nMinor comments: \n1. Table 3:  The reported evaluation score is not mentioned, which might be FID.\n2. The \u201cmoving average\u201d has not been well addressed in the main paper. \n3.

Specifically, this work aims to find a dedicated architecture for each class.  \n\nStrengths:  \n-Paper is well written.  \n-Demonstrates that optimizing architectures for each class yields some improvement over using a single architecture for all classes.  \n-Architectures learned by the NAS reveal insights about how to use existing building blocks, such as where best to place feature modulation layers in the network.  \n\nWeaknesses:  \n-No random baseline (see [1]).  \n-Given how close NAS-cGAN and NAS-caGAN are in terms of performance, confidence intervals should be reported to confirm that improvement is significant.  \n-Majority of improvement comes from fine-tuning on each class individually. It is unclear how much of this improvement is simply due to additional capacity.  \n-Complexity of the model appears to be disproportionate to the improvement in performance (lots of implementation effort for a somewhat small gain in performance).  \n\nRecommendation and Justification:  \nWhile I think this paper is well written, after reading it I am not convinced of the usefulness of the core idea, which is that generator architectures should be class-aware. It is never explained why it might be desirable for each class to have a distinct generator network, and I cannot think of any reason why this may be the case aside from increased model capacity. For this reason I think that this paper is currently marginally below the acceptance threshold, but look forward to the author's explanation.  \n\nClarifying Questions:  \n-How is calibration performed exactly? Is this procedure the same for NAS-cGAN and NAS-caGAN? Is a separate copy of weights fine-tuned for each class?  If a new copy of weights needs to be created for each class, proper comparison would be to a non-NAS model with up to n_classes times more model capacity than the base model.  \n\n[1] Li, Liam, and Ameet Talwalkar. \"Random search and reproducibility for neural architecture search.\" Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.

Within the framework, the paper also proposes an operator, Class-Modulated convolution (CMconv), to allow the training data to be shared among different architectures, so as to balance the training data across classes. The proposed method leverages a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the search algorithm, and learns the sampling policy for NAS. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the class-aware NAS can outperform class-agnostic NAS.\n\n- The paper is well written with sufficient figures and plots. \n- The proposed idea is straightforward and convincing.\n- Rich experiments and analysis are conducted. Implementation details are clearly described in the appendix.\n- I like the figures architecture searched specifically for different classes.\n\nHowever, I still have some concerns:\n\n- From my point of view, the proposed CMconv has exactly the same architecture as the one in Karras et al., instead of using class embedding as input. Please clarify the difference and clearly point out in the paper.\n\n- Quantitative results in Table 2 seem not promising. The proposed method is not compatible with the SOTA. Although the paper claims that the proposed idea can be applied to the existing methods and performs better, there\u2019s no evidence showing that.\n\n- It\u2019d be better to also list infra-FIDs of one existing unconditioned GAN method in the Table 1, for the lower bound / baseline of the experiments.\n\n- For fair comparison, it\u2019s better to have a table with quantitative results of IS/FID on CIFAR-10, listing the existing methods with conditioned/unconditioned, such as AutoGAN, style GAN etc. \n\nOverall, the proposed method is interesting, NAS by MDP with class-aware functionality, which can ideally outperform the class-agnostic based method. The experiments are comprehensive, with strong ablation study and analysis. However, it still requires some clarification and convincing experiments to demonstrate the performance. \n\nI'm willing to rate higher if the concerns are addressed.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2548/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper2548/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Searching towards Class-Aware Generators for Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks", "authorids": ["~Peng_Zhou2", "~Lingxi_Xie1", "~XIAOPENG_ZHANG7", "~Bingbing_Ni3", "~Qi_Tian3"], "authors": ["Peng Zhou", "Lingxi Xie", "XIAOPENG ZHANG", "Bingbing Ni", "Qi Tian"], "keywords": ["NAS", "cGAN"], "abstract": "Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) were designed to generate images based on the provided conditions, e.g., class-level distributions.
