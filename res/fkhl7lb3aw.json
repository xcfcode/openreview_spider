Specifically, the proposed ROGA generates samples of minority classes by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to explore the sample space. Moreover, to reduce the noise samples generated by ROGA, the authors propose to calculate the fitness as the Gaussian similarity with the surrounding samples and eliminate the samples with low fitness. My detailed comments are as follows.\n\nPositive points:\n1. The authors propose an algorithm named ROGA to generate samples of minority classes to balance the quantitative difference between classes.\n\n2. To reduce the noise samples, the authors propose to calculate the fitness as the Gaussian similarity with the surrounding samples and eliminate the samples with low fitness. \n\n3. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nNegative points:\n1. The authors argue that the generation space of the proposed method is widened mainly due to the initial random sampling over the entire sample space. However, during the optimization process of GA, the sample space may be rapidly narrowed down, which makes the generation space much smaller. How to demonstrate that ROGA can ensure the sample generation space is as wide as possible during the optimization? More description and experimental analysis are required.\n\n2. The experiments are insufficient in Section 4.3. In Table 3, the compared methods are SMOTE [1] and its extensions, which are not up-to-date. It would be better to compare ROGA with more closely related and up-to-date methods such as OHEM [2], Focal Loss [3], and SMOTE-WENN[4].\n\n3. It is not clear why the samples with low fitness are selected to perform the crossover and mutation operation. Does the algorithm converge effectively under this setting?\n\n4. The reason behind the choice of the mutation operation is not clear. Why the feature value can only be positively scaled?\n\n5. Lots of experimental details such as hyper-parameters $p$, $\\beta$, training iterations, and the probability of crossover/mutation are missing, which makes the paper hard to be reproduced.\n\n6. In Table 3, why the performance of the proposed method on the wine_quality data set is much poorer than others. More explanations are required.\n\n7. The ablation study is insufficient. $K$ plays an important role in sample generation. More results on different values of $K$ are required.\n\nMinor issues:\n1. In Section 2.2, \u201cRACOG and WRACOG (Das et al. (2015)) used the dependency tree algorithm \u2026\u201d should be \u201cRACOG and WRACOG (Das et al. (2015)) use the dependency tree algorithm \u2026\u201d.\n\n2. In the Introduction, \u201coversampling methods only can estimated \u2026\u201d should be \u201coversampling methods only can estimate \u2026\u201d.\n\n3. In Section 4.4, \u201ctraditional oversampling paradigm that try to \u2026\u201d should be \u201ctraditional oversampling paradigm that tries to \u2026\u201d.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Nitesh V.

Each individual in the GA population corresponds to a synthetic sample, and the fitness function is based on the similarity (in feature space) of the synthetic sample compared to nearby samples of the same and different classes; standard crossover and mutation operators are used. In a limited set of experiments, the proposed approach sometimes outperforms competing approaches.\n\nI think the basic idea of using a GA to avoid local minima in the feature space is reasonable, and the proposed fitness function makes sense, though it is perhaps a bit obvious. However, I believe the paper has several key limitations that need to be addressed.\n\nThe discussion on related work omits a large number of highly related references. In particular, a large number of existing papers propose to use genetic algorithms for oversampling, including: [Saladi and Dash, Soft Computing for Problem Solving, 2019], [Tallo and Musdholifah, ICST, 2018], [Ha and Lee, IMCOM 2016], and [Qiong et al., JDIM 2016]. While the proposed approach likely differs from these in some respects, the complete lack of context with respect to existing GA approaches for addressing class imbalance makes it difficult to judge the methodological novelty.\n\nSecond, the set of baselines considered in the work is rather limited. Thus, it is not clear if the paper meaningfully improves empirical performance compared to state of the art. In addition to lacking any other GA baselines, the experiments also lack a representative generative adversarial network-based approach. Considering the prevalence of such approaches, at least a standard implementation should be included in the comparison.\n\nThird, the experimental design itself could be significantly improved. The current design does not allow for any estimate of variance in performance of the methods on each dataset. Thus, it is not possible to tell if any of the results are significant. Indeed, additional experiments suggest that the proposed approach is not stable, so that further calls into question the empirical advantage of this approach. A simple way to estimate such variances could be to perform cross-validation by bootstrapping the dataset (e.g., k-fold cross-validation). It is also not clear how the hyperparameters for the other baseline methods are selected.\n\nIt is also not clear how the approach may work for datasets with non-numeric features, such as text or images.

Results in classification scenarios with imbalance dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nA lot of grammatical errors mar the readability of the manuscript. Resolving them through proofreading and copy-editing would improve the clarity of the paper. \n\nThe related work section is extensive and provides a good overview of related literature on methods that address class imbalances. However, the whole section reads like a laundry list of previous methods instead of painting a cohesive story about what has been done, what gaps remain and most importantly how the proposed method (ROGA) can address these gaps. It is difficult to place where ROGA fits in amongst previous literature.\n\nSection 4.2 (definitions for accuracy, precision, recall, F1, TP, FP) is background and does not belong in the method section. I would suggest that these could be removed entirely from the paper as this are basic machine learning terms that are well known and understood.  \n\nThe presented results seem to be the max score achieved across 20 independent experiments. Is this correct? If so, this will have high bias. Why not report the first order statistics based on the 20 experiments? For example, the mean score achieved, and standard deviation would enable the reader to have a much more balanced view of the method\u2019s merits and limitation.\nFurther, it seems this max selection was not used for the other baselines in the comparative results. This would raise significant questions regarding the validity of the comparative results.\n\nWhat is the added computational cost of ROGA versus a traditional oversampling method that does not use a population? Since the fitness uses K-nearest neighbor Gaussian similarity, the computation overhead can be substantial depending on how many iterations must be run. This should be reported as it is an important consideration in large scale deployments. \n\nThe novelty in the method is marginal. The principal contribution of the method is an attempt to leverage the diversity benefits of a population-based method (GA in this case) towards generating higher quality synthetic samples for oversampling. However, the results as they stand do not fully corroborate that this benefit translates effectively to improved performance. \n", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1413/AnonReviewer4"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2021/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2021/Conference/Paper1413/AnonReviewer4"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "ROGA: Random Over-sampling Based on Genetic Algorithm", "authorids": ["~ZONGDA_HAN1", "qiaoxq@bupt.edu.cn", "zhanshubo@cincc.cn"], "authors": ["ZONGDA HAN", "XIUQUAN QIAO", "SHUBO ZHAN"], "keywords": ["class imbalance", "over-sampling", "genetic algorithm"], "abstract": "When using machine learning to solve practical tasks, we often face the problem of class imbalance.
