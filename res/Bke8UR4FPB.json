The core observation is that the Jacobian of a ReLU network is piecewise constant w.r.t to the input. This Jacobian is chosen to encode the hard splits of a decision tree. The paper establishes an exact equivalence between decision trees and a slightly modified form of the locally constant networks (LCN). The LCN used for experiments is slightly relaxed to allow for training, including \"annealing\" from a the softplus nonlinearity to ReLU during training, adding one or more output layers to perform the final prediction, and training with connection dropout. Experiments show LCN models outperform existing methods for oblique decision trees, but ensembles are often matched or outperformed by random forests.\n\n*Rating*\nPerhaps the greatest attribute of decision trees is utter simplicity. (The second best attribute the out-of-the-box competitive accuracy of tree ensembles on a wide variety of problems.) An argument to be made for this paper is that it leverages the machinery of learning DNNs to learn more powerful, oblique tree-like models. The counterpoint is that despite the added complication, it's still often beaten by ensembles of CART trees. Overall, the idea is clever, the presentation could be improved slightly, and the experiments raise existential questions for this kind of work. My current rating is weak reject.\n\n(1) It's difficult to know how LCNs should be compared to traditional decision trees, with accuracy, number of parameters, prediction speed, and training time/parallelism as viable components. The paper focuses almost exclusively on accuracy, while cross-validating over model sizes and other hyperparameters. This is a reasonable choice, though a discussion of model size and prediction speed would be welcome. I do have two significant questions about the experiments:\n\n(2) It seems unfair that LCN has access to one or more hidden layers between the splits and the final output, denoted g_\\phi. Would competing decision tree models improve with such a layer learned and appended to the final tree? Would LCN suffer from using a tabular representation like the others?\n\n(3) Despite the assertion that these are datasets that necessitate tree-like predictors, the LLN method outperforms LCN and the trees on 4/5 datasets and is competitive with ensemble methods. While not explicitly stated, am I correct that LLN is essentially a traditional ReLU-network? If high accuracy is the goal, then why should I go to the trouble of training LCN when a traditional DNN is better. And if a tree is needed, then LCNs should be evaluated on more than just accuracy.\n\n(4) LCNs seem to present a less bulky alternative to e.g. Deep Neural Decision Trees (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06988), but that work should be cited and discussed\n\n(5) The proof sketch in Section 3.6 of the equivalence between the \"standard architecture\" and decision trees is difficult to understand and not convincing. (On second reading I noticed the subtle vector \"\\mathbf 0\" indicating that all entries of \"\\grad_x a^i_1\" are zero. Some further exposition and enumeration of steps would clear up confusion.)\n\n(6) Overall the presentation is reasonable, other than the notes below. I did find myself searching back over the (dense) notation section and following sections looking for definitions of variables and terms used later. Consider better formatting (e.g. more definitions in standalone equations), strategic pruning of some material to make it less dense, and repeating some definitions in line (e.g. see below for \"p7:... remind the reader\").\n\n*Notes*\n(Spelling typos throughout; most are noted below)\np3: clarify in 3.1/3.3 that L is the number of outputs\np4: \"interpred\"\np5: \"aother\"\np5: Theorem 2 proof: note that the T/T' notation is capturing left/right splits\np5: \"netwoworks\"\np5: \"Remark 5 is important for learning shallow...\": should \"shallow\" be \"narrow\" instead?\np7: in the first paragraph, remind the reader of the definitions of \u00f5^M and J_x \u00e3^M\np7: \"Here we provide a sketch of [the] proof\"\np7: \"unconstraint\" should be \"unconstrained\"\np7: \"...can construct a [sufficiently expressive] network g_\\theta\"\np7: \"simlify\"\np9: Table 2: instead of \"2nd row\", ..., use \"1st section\", ...; also consider noting which methods are introduced in this paper\np9: Figure 2: text is too small\n", "review_assessment:_checking_correctness_of_derivations_and_theory": "I carefully checked the derivations and theory."}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1139/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1139/AnonReviewer3"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["guanghe@csail.mit.edu", "tommi@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Oblique Decision Trees from Derivatives of ReLU Networks", "authors": ["Guang-He Lee", "Tommi S.

Furthermore, due to how the locally linear regions of f can be partitioned, canonical LCNs are strictly less powerful than oblique decision trees given a fixed depth M as proved in Sec. 3.5. \n\nHence, we obtain the claimed ordering. In fact, by Theorem 8 (updated, originally given as a sketch of proof), we can even prove standard LCNs = canonical LCNs.\n\n\n(3) Yes, LLNs are ReLU networks. The point of including LLN is to compare it with ALCN, since both are continuous functions and thus much more powerful than tree methods. We show that ALCN often outperforms LLN. \n\nIf high accuracy is the only goal, currently random forests work well for these chemical/tabular data, outperforming neural networks with ReLU activations by a large margin. However, please see our general response above for why LCN still provides new insights in this setting.\n\nIf a tree model is needed, clearly LCNs are much better than traditional oblique decision trees: we can often get 10% absolute improvements in testing AUC. Since LCN can always be explicitly converted to an oblique decision tree, the only difference *in testing time* between oblique decision trees and LCNs is the accuracy. Other factors are discussed in (1).\n\n(4) Thank you for the reference. It seems a relevant paper that also uses deep networks to learn decision trees. The paper focused on axis-parallel decisions (traditional decision trees), while we work on oblique decisions. We will cite and discuss the paper in the camera-ready version. \n\n(5) Thank you for the feedback. The sketch of the proof is now replaced by a formal theorem with proof in Appendix A.2.\n\n(6) and *Notes*: Thank you for the comments. The typos have been addressed, and we will improve the other presentation issues in later revision. \n\nRe \"Remark 5 is important for learning shallow...\" Thank you for pointing this out. Here we meant that given a fixed number of neurons, the one neuron per layer setting is the most powerful architecture.\n\nMinor technical clarification: we \u201canneal\u201d LCNs during training, but the LCNs used in testing time are indeed piece-wise constant (not relaxed). Adding any number of layers mapping from the Jacobian to the prediction does not affect the piece-wise constant nature. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1139/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2020/Conference/Paper1139/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2020/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"authorids": ["guanghe@csail.mit.edu", "tommi@csail.mit.edu"], "title": "Oblique Decision Trees from Derivatives of ReLU Networks", "authors": ["Guang-He Lee", "Tommi S.

LCNs is competitive with the state-of-the-art method. \n    (b) Training speed:\n        (i) If assuming matrix multiplication and a batch can be fully parallelized, the time complexity is O(MT (N/B) ), where M is the tree depth, T is the number of epochs, N is the number of data, and B is the batch size. One can always tune the batch size and the number of epochs (and even optimizers) to optimize training speed. We only tuned the validation performance in our experiments.\n        (ii) The time complexity for traditional methods is hard to analyze precisely, since the number of data in each split highly depends on the dataset. \n        (iii) In our experiments, the training time with depth = 12 on the HIV dataset is 8.8 min for HHCART / 8.6 min for TAO / 18.0 min for LCN with batch size = 64. \n    (c) Model size:\n        (i) The space complexity of decision nodes in oblique decision trees is O(2^M D).

HMEs use softmax units instead of decision units in non-terminal nodes, so HMEs only approach oblique decision trees in the theoretical limit. Hence, HMEs realize continuous functions instead of piece-wise constant functions as oblique decision trees. \n\nThere are some practical advantages of using oblique decision trees over HMEs-style (soft) decision trees. For example, it requires a full tree traversal for HMEs to make a prediction in O(2^M) where M denotes the tree depth, while it only takes O(M) for oblique decision trees to make a prediction. Moreover, being piece-wise constant allows us to tractably compute some useful inference problems like \u201cwhat is the feasible region of input space that leads to a specific prediction value / diagnosis\u201d. \n\nNevertheless, we can still do an empirical comparison with HMEs. We use the HME implementation with the most stars on GitHub: https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Mixture-Models\n\nEven with parallel computing on 16 CPUs, the implementation is still prohibitively slow due to the inherent complexity of the HME learning algorithm (exponential to tree depth), and we can only obtain some early results on small datasets. The experiment protocol is the same. We tune the depth in {2,3,...,12} by validation set, and report the testing performance of the tuned model. \n\nWe report (mean \u00b1 std) of testing AUC score over multiple runs. \nBace: \nHME (4 runs):    0.706 \u00b1 0.009\nLCN (10 runs):   0.839 \u00b1 0.013\nALCN (10 runs): 0.854 \u00b1 0.007\n\nSider:  \nHME (1 run):      0.582 \u00b1 0.000\nLCN (10 runs):   0.624 \u00b1 0.044\nALCN (10 runs): 0.653 \u00b1 0.044\n\nEmpirically, HME performs much worse than the proposed LCN and ALCN models. \n\nIt takes 4.5 hours to train an HME on the Bace dataset with depth = 12, and it takes 42.3 hours on the HIV dataset with depth = 6, so we cannot report the complete experiments for the other datasets during rebuttal.

The authors built the equivalence between LCN and decision trees, and also demonstrated that LCN with M neurons has the same representation capability as decision trees with 2^M leaf nodes. The experiments conducted in the paper disclose that training LCN outperforms other methods using decision trees. \n\nThe detailed comments are as follows:\n\n1) The idea of LCN is very interesting, and the equivalence to decision trees is also very valuable, as it provides interpretability and shines light on new training algorithms. \n\n2) The derivation of LCN and the equivalence is clear. The analysis based on the shared parameterization in Section 3.5 is helpful to understand why LCN with M neurons could be of equal capability to decision trees with 2^M leaf nodes. \n\n3) One weakness is that the performance of ELCN seems to be very close to RF, as shown in Table 2. \n\nI am not sure whether some similar ideas to LCN have been explored in the literature.
