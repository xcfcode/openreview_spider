Another contribution of the paper is theoretical treatment of (a simplified version of) the proposed architecture showing that it can\u2019t fit random noise (and thus maybe better suited for denoising).\n\nThe paper is clearly written, and the proposed architecture has too cool properties: it\u2019s compact enough to be used for image compression; and it doesn\u2019t overfit thus making early stopping notnesesary (which was crucial for the original DIP model).\n\nI have two main concerns about this paper.\nFirst, it is somewhat misleading about its contributions: it's not obvious from abstract/introduction that the whole model is the same as DIP except for the proposed architecture. Specifically, the first contribution listed in the introduction makes it look like this paper introduces the idea of not learning the decoder on the dataset (the one that starts with \u201cThe network is not learned and itself incorporates all assumptions on the data.\u201d).\n\nMy second concern is about the theoretical contribution. On the one hand, I enjoyed the angle the authors tackled proving that the network architecture is underparameterized enough to be a good model for denoising. On the other hand, the obtained results are very weak: only one layered version of the paper is analysed and the theorem applies only to networks with less than some threshold of parameters. Roughly, the theorem states that if for example we fix any matrix B of size e.g. 256 x k and matrix U of size 512 x 256 and then compute U relu(B C) where C is the vector of parameters of size k x 1, AND if k < 2.5 (i.e. if we use at most 2 parameters), then it would be very hard to fit 512 iid gaussian values (i.e. min_C ||U relu(B C) - eta|| where eta ~ N(0, 1)). This restriction of the number of parameters to be small is only mentioned in the theorem itself, not in the discussion of its implications.\nAlso, the theorem only applies to the iid noise, while most natural noise patterns have structure (e.g. JPEG artifacts, broken pixels, etc) and thus can probably be better approximated with deep models.\n\nSince the paper manages to use very few parameters (BTW, how many parameters in total do you have? Can you please add this number to the text?), it would be cool to see if second order methods like LBFGS can be applied here.\n\nSome less important points:\n\nFig 4 is very confusing.\nFirst, it doesn\u2019t label the X axis.\nSecond, the caption mentions that early stopping is beneficial for the proposed method, but I can\u2019t see it from the figure.\nThird, I don\u2019t get what is plotted on different subplots. The text mentions that (a) is fitting the noisy image, (b) is fitting the noiseless image, and (c) is fitting noise. Is it all done independently with three different models? Then why does the figure says test and train loss? And why DIP loss goes up, it should be able to fit anything, right? If not and it\u2019s a single model that gets fitted on the noisy image and tested on the noiseless image, then how can you estimate the level of noise fitting? ||G(C) - eta|| should be high if G(C) ~= x.\nAlso, in this quote \u201cIn Fig. 4(a) we plot the Mean Squared Error (MSE) over the number of iterations of the optimizer for fitting the noisy astronaut image x + \u03b7 (i.e., FORMULA ...\u201d the formula doesn\u2019t correspond to the text.\nAnd finally, the discussion of this figure makes claims about the behaviour of the model that seems to be too strong to be based on a single image experiment.\n\nI don\u2019t get the details of the batch normalization used: with respect to which axis the mean and variance are computed?\n\nThe authors claim that the model is not convolutional. But first, it\u2019s not obvious why this would be a good thing (or a bad thing for that matter). Second, it\u2019s not exactly correct (as noted in the paper itself): the architecture uses 1x1 convolutions and upsampling, which combined give a weak and underparametrized analog of convolutions.\n\n> The deep decoder is a deep image model G: R N \u2192 R n, where N is the number of parameters of the model, and n is the output dimension, which is typically much larger than the number of parameters (N << n).\nI think it should be vice versa, N >> n\n\nThe following footnote\n> Specifically, we took a deep decoder G with d = 6 layers and output dimension 512\u00d7512\u00d73, and choose k = 64 and k = 128 for the respective compression ratios.\nUses unintroduced (at that point) notation and is very confusing.\n\nIt would be nice to have a version of Figure 6 with k = 6, so that one can see all feature maps (in contrast to a subset of them).\n\nI\u2019m also wondering, is it harder to optimize the proposed architecture compared to DIP?

The theorem uses the assumption: k^2 log(n_0)  / n <= 1/32. This is equal to k^2 <= n/ (32 \\log(n) ), and with the parameters of the described case, this indeed says that k^2 <= 2.56. However, the constant 1/32 is not optimal and can be made larger, e.g., by increasing the probability in the statement. Then the bound on k would be less restrictive. The condition essentially says that k^2, the number of parameters, should be smaller (by a logarithmic factor) than the dimension of the output. In this regime the decoder is underparameterized, and throughout the paper, we operate in the regime where the decoder is underparameterized.\n\nThanks for asking your colleagues, that is certainly helpful! We do think that the architecture is quite different: our architecture is an underparameterized network without convolutions and an decoder-like structure, while the architecture of the DIP is overparameterized and has an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections.

Not only does the network require no training (just as the DIP); it also does not critically rely on regularization, for example by early stopping (in contrast to the DIP).''\nBefore that, in the introduction, in the original and revised version, we have a paragraph devoted to the DIP explaining that Ulyanov et al. introduced the idea of using a deep neural network without learning as an image model.\n\n2/ Regarding the theoretical contribution: We fully agree that a limitation of the theorem is that it pertains to a one layered version of the decoder. We are currently extending this to the multilayer case, but still have to address a technical difficulty in counting the number of different sign pattern matrices. \n\nRegarding the assumptions: The proposition uses the assumption that k^2 log(n_0)  / n <= 1/32. Here, the constant 1/32 is not optimal. k^2 is essentially the number of parameters of the model, and n is the output dimension. \nThe proposition is only interesting if k^2 log(n_0)  / n <= 1/20 even without this assumption (due to the right hand side of the lower bound) therefore this assumption is not restrictive. \n\nThe bound is applicable if the number of parameters, k^2 is smaller than a logarithmic term times the number of output parameters, i.e., it allows the number of parameters to scale almost linearly in the output dimension. This is the regime in which the deep decoder operates throughout the paper.\n\nWe agree that many natural noise patterns have structure, and that those can be better approximated with deep models, and are thus more difficult to remove.\n\n3/ We have added the sentence ``In the default architectures with $d=6$ and $k=64$ or $k=128$, we have that N = 25,536 (for k=64) and N = 100,224 (k=128)\nout of an RGB image space of dimensionality 512\\times512\\times3=786,432 parameters.'' to specify the number of parameters. \nThanks for the suggestion to try second order method like LBFGS; we have tried LBFGS as a response to the reviewer's comment. It converges in significantly fewer iterations, but each iterations is so much more expensive that overall it optimizes slower than ADAM or gradient descent. \n\nMinor comments:\n\n1/ Figure 4: We have added labels and the sentence ``Early stopping can mildly enhance the performance of DD; to see this note that in panel (a), the minimum is obtained at around 5000 iterations and not at 50,000.'' in the caption to clarify. \nAlso, we have added the sentence ``Models are fitted independently for the noisy image, the noiseless image, and the noise.'', and rewrote the paragraph\nThanks for pointing this out!\nWe agree that here we present only results for one image, but we did carry out simulations for many images, and those plots are qualitatively the same for all the images considered. Thus our conclusions about the model do not only hold for one image.\n\n2/ Normalization is applied channel wise. Let z{ij} be the j-th column in the i-th layer. Then z{ij} is normalized independently of any of the other channels.\n\n3/ We have reworded the corresponding paragraphs to make clear that while we do not use convolutions, and thus this is not strictly speaking a convolutional neural network, it shares many structural similarities with a conventional neural network, as pointed out by the reviewer.\n\n4/ The equation is correct in that the parameter choices in the paper are such that the deep decoder has much fewer model parameters N than its output dimension. Thus N is much less than n.\n\n5/ We agree that it is not optimal to use unintroduced notation at this point, but we made this compromise so that we can illustrate the performance of the deep decoder without introducing its details, but wanted to give a reader the chance to later see exactly what parameters we used.\n\n6/ Unfortunately choosing k=6 is too small to have a small representation error, i.e., to represent the image well. We have, however not hand-selected the 8 images shown out of the 64, and the other 64-8 images look very similar. We have all the images in the jupyter notebook that comes with the paper.\n\n7/ Great question, it is faster to optimize the deep decoder since the adam/SGD steps are cheaper, but it indeed seems to require slightly more iterations for best performance than the DIP. \n"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1162/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1162/Reviewers/Unsubmitted"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1162/Authors", "ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Decoder: Concise Image Representations from Untrained Non-convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements.

To reflect both points, we have revised the text to:  \n``The network does not use convolutions. \nInstead, the network does have pixelwise linear combinations of channels, and just like in a convolutional neural network the weights are \nare shared among spatial positions.\nNonetheless, they are not convolutions because they provide no spatial coupling between pixels, despite how pixelwise linear combinations are sometimes called `1x1 convolutions.' '',\nand we have also added a subsection comparing the compression performance of our architecture to that of a decoder with convolution layers. In a sense, what the deep decoder is doing is separating multiple roles that proper convolutional layers fill:  the DD breaks apart the spatial coupling inherent to convolutions from their channel dependence and equivariance. Further, it says that the spatial coupling need not be learned or fit to data, and can be directly imposed by upsampling.\n\n2/ Yes, the upsampling analysis in Figure 5 also extends to two-dimensional images. We agree that natural images are only approximately piece-wise smooth after all, and the deep decoder only provides an approximation of natural images (albeit a very good one).\n\n3/ We agree and have changed `batch normalization' to `channel normalization' throughout.\n\n4/ Great point; we have added the sentence ``The optimal $k$ trades off those two errors; larger noise levels require smaller values of $k$ (or some other form of regularization). \nIf the noise is significantly larger, then the method requires either choosing $k$ smaller, or it requires another means of regularization, for example early stopping of the optimization.\nFor example $k=64$ or $128$ performs best out of $\\{32,64,128\\}$, for a PSNR of around 20dB, while for a PSNR of about 14dB, $k=32$ performs best.''\n\n5/ We do not mention the standard deviation, but do specify the SNR throughout (e.g., in table 1 in column identity).

They provide a structured and deterministic function G that maps a set of parameters C to an image X = G(C). The number of parameters C is smaller than the number of free parameters in the image X, so this results in a predictive model that can be used for compression, denoising, inpainting, superresolution and other inverse problems.\n\nThe structure of G is as follows: starting with a small fixed, multichannel white noise image, linearly mix the channels, truncate the negative values to zero and upsample. This process is repeated multiple times and finally the output is squashed through a sigmoid function for the output to remain in the 0..1 range.\n\nThis approach makes sense and the model is indeed more principled than the one taken by Ulyanov et al. In fact, the DIP of Ulyanov et al. can hardly be considered \"a model\" (or a prior, for that matter), and instead should be considered \"an algorithm\", since it relies on the early stopping of a specific optimization algorithm. This means that we are not interested in the minimum of the cost function associated to the model, which contradicts the very concept of \"cost function\". If only global optimizers were available, DIP wouldn't work, showing its value is in the interplay of the \"cost\" function and a specific optimization algorithm. None of these problems exist with the presented approach.\n\nThe exposition is clear and the presented inverse problems as well as demonstrated performance are sufficient.\n\nOne thing that I missed while reading the paper is more comment on negative results. Did the authors tried any version of their model with convolutions or pooling and found it not to perform as well? Measuring the number of parameters when including pooling or convolutions can become tricky, was that part of the reason?\n\nMinor:\n\n\"Regularizing by stopping early for regularization,\"\n\nIn this paper \"large compression ratios\" means little compression, which I found confusing.\n", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1162/AnonReviewer3"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Decoder: Concise Image Representations from Untrained Non-convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements.

The parameter of the convolution are fitted to each target image, where the source noise tensor is fixed. The method is shown to serve as a good model for natural image for a variety of image processing tasks such as denoising and compression.\n\nPros:\n* an interesting model which is quite intriguing in its simplicity.\n* good results and good analysis of the model\n* mostly clear writing and presentation (few typos etc. nothing too serious).\n\nCons and comments:\n* The author say explicitly that this is not a convolutional model because of the use of 1x1 convolutions. I disagree and I actually think this is important for two reasons. First, though these are 1x1 convolutions, because of the up-sampling operation and the layer wise normalizations the influence of each operation goes beyond the 1x1 support. Furthermore, and more importantly is the weight sharing scheme induced by this - using convolutions is a very natural choice for natural images (no pun intended) due to the translation invariant statistics of natural images. I doubt this would have worked so well hadn't it been modeled this way (not to mention this allows a small number of parameters).\n\n* The upsampling analysis is interesting but it is only done on synthetic data - will the result hold for natural images as well? should be easy to try and will allow a better understanding of this choice. Natural images are only approximately piece-wise smooth after all.\n\n* The use of the name \"batch-norm\" for the layer wise normalization is both wrong and misleading. This is just channel-wise normalization with some extra parameters - no need to call it this way (even if it's implemented with the same function) as there is no \"batch\".\n\n* I would have loved to see actual analysis of the method's performance as a function of the noise standard deviation. Specifically, for a fixed k, how would performance increase or decrease, and vice versa - for a given noise level, how would k affect performance.\n\n* The actual standard deviation of the noise is not mentioned in any of the experiments (as far as I could tell)\n\n* What does the decoder produce when taking a trained C on a given image and changing the source noise tensor? I think that would shed light on what structures are learned and how they propagated in the image, possibly more than Figure 6 (which should really have something to compare to because it's not very informative out of context).", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1162/AnonReviewer2"], "readers": ["everyone"], "nonreaders": [], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"], "details": {"replyCount": 0, "writable": false, "overwriting": [], "revisions": false, "forumContent": {"title": "Deep Decoder: Concise Image Representations from Untrained Non-convolutional Networks", "abstract": "Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements.
