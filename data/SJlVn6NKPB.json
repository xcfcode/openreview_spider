Although unlabeled data is abundant, recent self-supervised learning approaches are ill-suited to the remote sensing domain. In addition, most remote sensing applications currently use only a small subset of the multi-sensor, multi-channel information available, motivating the need for fused multi-sensor representations. We propose a new self-supervised training objective, Contrastive Sensor Fusion, which exploits coterminous data from multiple sources to learn useful representations of every possible combination of those sources. This method uses information common across multiple sensors and bands by training a single model to produce a representation that remains similar when any subset of its input channels is used. Using a dataset of 47 million unlabeled coterminous image triplets, we train an encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations from any possible combination of channels from the input sensors. These representations outperform fully supervised ImageNet weights on a remote sensing classification task and improve as more sensors are fused.", "keywords": ["unsupervised learning", "representation learning", "deep learning", "remote sensing", "sensor fusion"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The authors present a method for learning representations of remote sensing images from multiple views.

The essential idea is to enforce similarity between representations of multiple views obtained by subsetting channels from multiple co-terminus sensor outputs.  This is implemented by training with the InfoNCE loss on high-level features (last two layers of a ResNet 50) of two views of the same image and multiple view of other images which are passed through the same weight-shared network. The evaluation is based on a custom task of classifying OSM labels. The results show that (a) the learned representation (up to 3 chosen channels) outperform a pre-trained ImageNet fine-tuned for the classification task, (b) multiple low resolution sensors can outperform a higher resolution sensor, and (c) visualisation of images indicates that stable high-level representations across sensors. \n\nThe paper makes a worthwhile contribution in introducing contrastive methods to satellite imagery - a domain well suited for analysing how contrastive methods work and also rich in applications of sensor fusion/augmentation for remote sensing applications. The experiments indicate that this is a promising direction, and the authors have helpfully open-sourced the dataset they used. The paper, however, is short on several accounts. Primarily, the experimental evaluation is sparse in detail and rigour. In addition, the paper makes unsubstantiated claims to \u201cargue out\u201d certain baselines from being compared. Finally, the results indicate modest improvements on a custom task, and thus remain inconclusive. \n\nThe paper bases all experimental evaluation and conclusions thereof on the custom task of classifying 12 classes of distinctive objects on 8400 images obtained from OpenStreetMap (OSM). These include diverse categories spanning generic bodies (water, forest), specific structures (substation, bridge), similar items (farm, farmland). The paper does not discuss why this is a good task (is it challenging, is it representative of remote sensing applications, are these most frequent OSM classes). Indeed, the experimental results provide no intuition on the classification task (eg. confusion matrix is essential especially given the middling accuracy of about 0.5). \n\nThe paper makes a strong claim that the \u201cdistributional hypothesis\u201d (of expecting that spatial or temporal similarity reflect in representation similarity) does not apply to satellite imagery because \u201cremote sensing imagery \u2026 can change abruptly between adjacent patches\u201d. No evidence is provided of what I believe is an unintuitive claim. Indeed, existing work [1] (as cited in the paper) uses this hypothesis to create representations for satellite images. Glaringly, having made the claim, the paper does not compare proposed approach with the representations computed in [1].  The paper also makes the claim that computing representation loss should be done with high-level features rather than individual pixels. Again, this is not substantiated as the paper does not compare the proposed methods with simple auto-encoder baselines. In the absence of these baselines, the results of this paper on a custom data-set remain inconclusive. \n\nThe evaluation leaves out several other expected experiments. A few suggested conditions for ablation tests are listed:\n(a) Different augmentation across channels\n(b) Different values of \\lambda_L (only an extreme case of last two layers has been presented)\n(c) At least one other CNN-backbone, perhaps a deeper ResNet\n(d) Different orderings of introducing the channels (not only by low or high resolution ordering)\n(e) Different sizes of the tiles for learning representations (curiously the paper does not mention the size of the tiles as used currently)\n\nFinally, and more broadly, the proposed approach aims to compensate the lack of supervised labels by exploiting redundancy across multiple sensors/channels. In the chosen setup, this redundancy is very high as 4 different RGBI co-terminus sensors are chosen, thereby requiring augmenting and drop-out to simulate some variation.

Sometimes we do penalize the model for representing patches of one class the same way, but in practice the majority of batch examples correspond to distinct classes.

Fine-tuning, or learning a classifier on top of the frozen representation? In the case of fine-tuning, the ImageNet baseline could be extended to more channels.\u201d\n\nWe think there may be some misunderstanding as to our evaluation section. In our experiments, the representations are transferred as-is, with no fine-tuning or stacking additional models. We will update our paper to clarify this point, and to reflect that experiments with fine-tuning may be valuable further work.\n\n> \u201cAs an additional baseline, how does a network trained from scratch on the available labeled training data perform?\u201d\n\nThe same network trained from scratch on the OpenStreetMap data, with access to labels, would undoubtedly produce much better representations for the task we measure (clustering points by category). However, we\u2019re aiming to demonstrate that CSF learns representations that are useful for many tasks, especially those for which large quantities of data are not available. We\u2019d like to point out that recent work in semi-supervised learning (e.g. [TODO: cite CPC v2 paper]) has achieved results competitive with supervised learning only by dramatically changing the network architectures between the two evaluations (in this case, from AlexNet to a very large ResNet). \n\n> \u201cThe authors evaluate on a single data set, that seems to not have been used previously.

We agree that evaluation on more standard benchmarks could strengthen our results. However, due to the aforementioned shortage of prior work on unsupervised learning in remote sensing, we did not find a comparable unsupervised benchmark using the data sources we had available \u2014 this is part of why we have open-sourced our data.

Does adding the backward prediction loss really help?\u201d\n\nBecause the two views are sampled independently, the loss is not actually symmetric. The loss is computed from a similarity matrix with row $i$ corresponding to view 1 of scene $i$ in the batch, and column $j$ corresponding to view 2 of scene $j$ in the batch \u2014 the rows and columns are not interchangeable. Using both the forward and backward loss adds supervisory signal, and it is a minor computational cost relative to that of the entire ResNet encoder.\n\n[1] Helber P, Bischke B, Dengel A, Borth D.

The argument is that in remote sensing one often has access only to a subset of all possible images/channels, so it would be useful to get the same embedding for each subset depicting the same scene. The basic idea is to generate, during training, two versions of the same patch by randomly dropping out channels, and to penalise the difference between the two corresponding embeddings, using the InfoNCE loss. The latter ensures that the patch remains \"recognisable\" among a set of random non-matching patches, so as to avoid learning a trivial embedding that is the same for any input.\n\nThe high-level goal, to train an encoder that always gives a similar encoding (and consequently similar downstream results) for a given patch, independent of the sensor channels used, is certainly appealing. It is also true that one would like to do this with unsupervised learning or transfer learning, since labelled data is scarce in remote sensing. Unfortunately, in my understanding the paper does not make much progress towards that goal.\n\nNovelty is limited, the work is a variation of the CMC method. Yes, it splits channels randomly, not by views; and uses a Siamese architecture, not separate encoders; which it can afford to do since there are no viewpoint differences. And it computes the loss at more than one layer - which is a fairly trivial and popular thing to do. Moreover it is not well justified in this case, since all that matters in a feed-forward architecture is that the final embeddings are similar. Constraining lower layers might empirically help - in particular speed up learning - but conceptually there is no reason to reduce the lower layers' capacity to somehow turn different inputs into the same output. If they are really very different (think RADAR images) this could in principle even hurt. \n\nBoth in the discussion and in the experiments, I miss crucial and obvious baselines. First, it does in my view not make sense to use pre-trained ImageNet features as the only baseline. Yes, they are known to work surprisingly well also for remote sensing data - but, unsurprisingly, not nearly as well as pre-training on similar remote sensing images. A more natural baseline would be to pre-train on the same type of imagery, with a proxy task for which it is easy to get labels automatically  - actually the paper implicitly suggests that labels from OpenStreetMap might be a good candidate. Beyond reducing the domain gap, this also has the advantage that one is not limited to 3 channels, and that one can use an architecture suitable for the task (e.g., standard architecture with a lot of pooling are known to not perform well for semantic segmentation of remote sensing data). Labels for supervised learning might in many remote sensing tasks be scarce, but to get any old labels and pre-train a reasonable proxy task is still easy, as map data is abundant.\n\nPerhaps even more important is another natural baseline. In spirit, the proposed method is closer to a generative embedding, since the supervision signal is not a discriminative task, but rather encourages embeddings to stay unique for each patch, and hence in principle fully decodable. Arguably, the most obvious way to achieve the same thing is a Siamese pair of auto-encoders for the two training patches, with an additional loss on the difference between the latent representations. Without that baseline it is impossible to tell whether the InfoNCE loss does a good job - in some sense it feels like making the task harder if one demands not only that a patch of water can be decoded from the embedding, but that it should be distinguishable from any other patch of water that resembles it even in raw pixel space.\n\nThe data used in the experiments is somewhat unconvincing, as it is really the opposite of diverse, multi-modal remote sensing channels. The same four R-G-B-NIR channels from sensors with not so different resolutions. The claim that the method homes in on high-level similarity and overcomes low-level radiometric differences would be much more credible if one uses short-wave infrared, thermal, perhaps even Radar images. Moreover, the gains are disappointingly small: even in the best case of 12 channels, the improvement over ImageNet pre-training is roughly from 4.5/10 correct neighbours to 5/10 correct neighbours. The even lower gains with fewer channels underline the need to have a pre-trained baseline without a massive domain gap. The classification accuracy of kNN does improve with the proposed embedding (at least for some combinations - for Pleiades RGB it is the same), but that experiment is unnatural. If one has the labels to do kNN, one might as well use them to train a proper classifier, i.e., add a couple of fully connected layers and fine-tune in a supervised fashion.\n\nA number of technical details in the experiments remain unclear. Section 4.2 suggests the channels in Fig. 4 were added in a fixed order - why? There are many potentially viable combinations of, say, 4 channels, not just one. Furthermore, Fig. 5 suggests to me that the learned similarities are in fact not \"high-level\", but (up to rotation invariance) fairly low-level texture properties like \"homogeneous green patch\", \"bright straight line on dark background\", etc. I am not sure what suggests to the authors that there is much sensor invariance. Again, channels with really different wavelength would be more convincing here.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the paper repeatedly makes strong, but unsupported claims about the special properties of remote sensing images.  It makes no sense to state that standard pictures often have \"one subject\" - ImageNet does, but a look at standard datasets like Cityscapes or DepthInTheWild shows that it is not true in general. In the same vein, I don't see why the content changes more unpredictably at the same location across time - arguably the rate of change is much lower, because only large-scale changes impact the image, and because there aren't many dynamic occluders. And the \"distributional hypothesis\" certainly also holds for remote sensing images, just at different scale - otherwise people would not use all sorts of smoothness priors, super-pixel segmentations, etc. when working with them. And I do not understand why the adjacent-patch approach of CPC needs nearby patches to be similar - in my view it only requires that nearby patches are not conditionally independent, so basically any type of patterns.\n\nA small detail: some references, while not wrong, seem rather arbitrary. E.g., (Wu 2018) is a little-known random example. Why not use earlier, more standard references - for semantic segmentation of remote sensing data with deep learning one could for example think of (Maggiori, Audebert, Marmanis, Kampffmeyer, Sherrah, ...).\n\nOverall, while the paper brings up a valid question, it does not give a convincing answer. The justification of the method and its novelty is to some degree contrived, the dataset is ill-suited to really prove the point, and the natural baselines are missing.", "title": "Official Blind Review #2", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 3}}}
