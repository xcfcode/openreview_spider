ST-DNN extend convolutional networks, which aggregate data from fixed shape (square) neighbor-hoods to compute descriptors, to be defined on arbitrarily shaped regions. This is useful for segmentation applications, where it is desired to have descriptors that aggregate data only within regions of segmentation to avoid mixing data from different regions, otherwise, the descriptors are difficult to group to a unique region.  We formulate these descriptors through partial differential equations (PDE) that naturally generalize convolution to arbitrary regions, and derive the methodology to jointly estimate the segmentation and ST-DNN descriptor.

ST-DNNs, in contrast to conv. layers, can natively support non-rectangular neighborhoods (regions). Similarly to conv. layers, ST-DNNs can be stacked to increase expressivity. ST-DNNs themselves correspond to solutions to the Poisson PDE. The paper describes how these layers can be trained and used for prediction. Results are reported on a texture dataset.\n\nNovelty\nThe authors suggest ST-DNNs that natively support non-rectangular regions. ST-DNNs are natively co-variant to translations and rotations (as opposed to CNNs)\n\nImpact\nST-DNNs can outperform CNN-based networks in a texture segmentation setting when the data is scarce.\nClarity\nThe paper is exceptionally clear. The mathematical reasoning is sound and the notation helps to understand the relationship between the components. The appendix contains a plethora of additional information and is clearly structured.\n\nEvaluation\nThe authors performed experiments with regard to two texture datasets, (i) Real-World Texture Segmentation, and (ii) Synthetic Texture Dataset. Both datasets are comparatively small (<300 images)\n\nStrengths (Reasons to accept)\nMathematically speaking, the paper presents solid derivations that are easy to follow. The notations help to understand the meaning.\nIn general, the clarity of the plots, the diagrams and the algorithms are good \nThe description of the training and the prediction phase is extraordinarily clear and sensical.\n\n\nWeaknesses (Reasons to reject)\nThe choice of the Poisson PDE seems somewhat arbitrary. The argumentation why this choice was made seems to also apply in a much more general context to simpler approaches\nThe authors argue (Related work) that pre-existing segmentation approaches have difficulty in handling the larger number of classes typically found in texture segmentation tasks. This claim doesn\u2019t seem warranted and a proper justification is missing.\nSection 3.2 mentions that images need inevitably to be downscaled to make the model fit into memory. This seems to be an achilles heel of the model that could have probably been addressed differently.\nThe evaluation of the paper is unnecessarily restricted to texture segmentation. It would have been interesting to test the system on classical segmentation problems that necessitate a more hierarchical segmentation approach (e.g. autonomous driving) as opposed to the very local nature of texture segmentation. If ST-DNNs underperform on mainstream segmentation tasks, this is valuable information to the community. \nMost of the proofs are straightforward (owed to the fact that some property is inherited from the Poisson PDE) and could have either been left out or abridged\nThe argument that neighborhoods ideally have to be non-rectangular is not entirely convincing. A practical toy example (simpler than texture segmentation) that showcases the (supposed) shortcomings of CNNs would be useful here.\nThe reliance on an initial mask is a limitation of ST-DNNs compared to conventional CNNs.\nAdmittedly, ST-DNNs seem to cope better with small dataset sizes than CNNs in the texture setting. The readers should be convinced that this property is important, perhaps through a high-impact example where data is scarce.\n\nFormatting\nThe authors did not follow the ICLR style for citations as described in Section 4 of the template, replacing named citations (e.g. Gou et al, 2017) with a numeric citation (12). This effectively gives the authors more space for content than competing submissions.\n\nQuestions and other comments to the authors\nWhich are the most compelling reasons to prefer Poisson PDEs over other PDEs or even simpler approaches?\n\n\n=============UPDATE==============\nI am generally satisfied with the answers provided by the reviewers and I have increased my score accordingly. \n", "title": "A clearly presented framework for shape-tailored networks, but needs better motivation", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "PS6OLbTDD9s": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SYGZtgPuK8g", "comment": "We would like to that the reviewer for the meticulous feedback, it has helped us improve the paper a lot.\n\n1. The choice of the Poisson PDE seems somewhat arbitrary. \n\nThe motivation for using Poisson PDE is as follows (see also page 3 paragraph tilted shape-tailored deep network):\nit is known that the derivative of Gaussians can approximate  convolutional kernels. The generalization of Gaussian smoothing to region of arbitrary shape is the Heat Equation, which is computationally expensive to solve. There we have chosen the Poisson equation as it is the steady state of a heat equation and it can be solved efficiently (see Appendix D for more details). We have added some explanation to the \"Additional Comments \" section in Supplementary material. The PDE formulation also allows us to acheive the theoretical guarantees for desirable covariance and robustness properties.\n\n\n2. pre-existing segmentation approaches have difficulty in handling the larger number of classes \n\nThis comment is sepcifically about semantic segmentation methods where the output classes are restricted to a few classes (usually around $10^2$) which is not comparable to the number of texture classes in real life.\n\n3. Section 3.2 mentions that images need inevitably to be downscaled to make the model fit into memory.\n\nImages are downsampled to use packages like PyTorch we have also trained on full size images and the downsampling does not result in any significant performance decrease (see Appendix D).\n\n4)\tThe evaluation of the paper is unnecessarily restricted to texture segmentation. \n\nWe would like to highlight that the main motivation of the paper is to present the first deep learning based segmentation method that is shape tailored and has desirable invariance/ robustness properties by design. DNN based methods, although they have been shown to work on semantic segmentation datasets, do not display these properties and hence their perfromance drop in many real settings where simple transformations of objects are widely present. Our work is primarily focused on the theoretical properties with proof of concept on textured datasets which displays a lot of these transformation like domain deformation, translation, rotation and scale change.\n\nAdditionaly we have  extended the experimetn section as well, kindly see the \u201cAdditional Experiments\u201d comments. \n\n\n5) Most of the proofs are straightforward (owed to the fact that some property is inherited from the Poisson PDE) and could have either been left out or abridged.\n\nThe proofs are in the Appdendix. Our intention in highlighting these properties in the main paper is to empahsize the fact that our's is the first Deep Learning based segmentation approach that exhibits these properties.  \n\n\n6) The argument that neighborhoods ideally have to be non-rectangular is not entirely convincing.\n\nRectangular feature aggreagate statistics from across the boundaries of objects/ regions making it difficult to localize object boundaries. This has been demonstrated in previous work e.g. Khan2015. We have added a comment to \"Additional Comments\" section in the supplementary material.\n\n7) The reliance on an initial mask is a limitation of ST-DNNs compared to conventional CNNs. \n\nThe method can be intitialized with the clustering of our descriptors computed on the region (R) chosen to be the entire image which gives a reasonable segmentation (with e.g artificats near the bounaries similar to existing semantic segmentation methods without the post-processing). Our method further refines the segmenation iteratively to increase the accuracy of the segmentation.

I see that the authors conducted two experiments on texture segmentation datasets where both are very small datasets. Why does this happen? Small datasets usually can not tell us statistic conclusions as random things always influence the results pretty much. Or is it because that ST-DNN can only be applied or be useful on small datasets? If yes, this needs to be stated and clarified in the paper.\n\nThe success of our methods on small trainingset is actually one of the strenghts of our methods. DNNs even if we train them on large scale datasets and finetune on small datasets, they fail to perform on par with our method.

Our loss is an efficient formulation for metric learning. Rather than optimizing the distance of the descriptor for a pair of pixels or a triplets, our energy optimizes the distance for all pixels in the regions. Furthermore, notice that our formulation is much more time and compute efficient. We have used cross entropy loss for deep learning methods just for completeness so that it is evident that cross entropy type losses don't work in appearance learning problems.
