However, when the number of labeled nodes is very small, the performances of GNNs downgrade dramatically. Self-training has proved to be effective for resolving this issue, however, the performance of self-trained GCN is still inferior to that of G2G and DGI for many settings. Moreover, additional model complexity make it more difficult to tune the hyper-parameters and do model selection. We argue that the power of self-training is still not fully explored for the node classification task. In this paper, we propose a unified end-to-end self-training framework called \\emph{Dynamic Self-traning}, which generalizes and simplifies prior work. A simple instantiation of the framework based on GCN is provided and empirical results show that our framework outperforms all previous methods including GNNs, embedding based method and  self-trained GCNs by a noticeable margin. Moreover, compared with standard self-training, hyper-parameter tuning for our framework is easier.", "keywords": ["self-training", "semi-supervised learning", "graph convolutional networks"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper is develops a self-training framework for graph convolutional networks where we have partially labeled graphs with a limited amount of labeled nodes.

The reason is that the computational cost of the original GCN model is dominated by previous layers, where the entire graph is included. So even if all nodes become pseudo labels, the size of the entire network is increased by at most a factor of 2, and the number of parameters remains the same. Therefore, the computational costs will increase by at most a small constant in theory. We have also verified this empirically. We record the training time of GCN and GAT before and after applying our framework. In the experiments, the training size is 20 per class, the number of epochs is 200, and the time is the average time (in seconds) of 25 runs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCora       \n           GCN        2.6\n         DSGCN     6.3\n           \n           GAT        4.7\n         DSGAT     8.7\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Citeseer\n          GCN         3.0\n         DSGCN     9.7\n\n         GAT           5.2\n        DSGAT      11.9\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. \"For CiteSeer 20 and 50, why does \\beta = 0.45 switch from the other experiments?\"\nWe didn\u2019t use \\beta = 0.45 for CiteSeer 20 and 50. As explicitly explained in the paper, we use a threshold of 0.6 when the number of labels per class is below 3 and set the threshold to 0.75 for label rate above 3 but below 10. Otherwise, the threshold is 0.9 by default. In Figure 1, \\beta=0.45 here is used for comparison with other thresholds on various label rate. We are sorry for any ambiguity in the paper. \n\n\n3. \"Will such self-training be useful for general NN self-training procedures\"\nWe believe our self-training method will be useful for general NN training, although we think it is most effective for GNN models.

For these models, we observe notable improvements even when the label rate is high. We emphasize that our framework is very flexible to use: to apply to a different a base model, the implementation and tuning is almost effortless. All the additional experimental results will be added in the final version.\n\n2. \"The proposed framework makes modification on the existing work, which is a good extension, but the novelty is limited.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t think our framework is a just modification of [1]. \n\nWe propose three techniques to address additional complexity introduced when applying a standard self-training framework. Our techniques are very effective in this aspect: only roughly 15 lines of code are needed to wrap any base GNN model, only one additional hyperparameter, and significant accuracy boosting even compare with standard self-training. \n\nMoreover, in our framework, we update the training set after each epoch instead of after a full training of the base model, and we also propose a simple gradient computation strategy, so that the training process is end-to-end and there are no explicit training stages as in standard multistage self-training. This makes the model easier to implement, train, and extend. \n\nOur framework's apparent simplicity might make it seem like a simple modification, but we don\u2019t think simple means limited novelty. Simplicity, flexibility, and better performance of our framework makes it more suitable to use in practice.\n\n3. \"The gap of the experiment results between the proposed method and the baseline methods are quite small.\"\nThis is not true. 1. The improvement achieved by dynamic self-train over the base model GCN could be more than 15%. 2. Compared with the four self-training methods in [1], the gap could be also as large as 14%. \n\n[1] Li et al.
