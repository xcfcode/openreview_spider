Our\ngoal is different than the standard sentiment analysis goal of predicting whether\na sentence expresses positive or negative sentiment; instead, we aim to infer the\nlatent emotional state of the user. Thus, we focus on predicting the emotion word\ntags attached by users to their Tumblr posts, treating these as \u201cself-reported emotions.\u201d\nWe demonstrate that our multimodal model combining both text and image\nfeatures outperforms separate models based solely on either images or text. Our\nmodel\u2019s results are interpretable, automatically yielding sensible word lists associated\nwith emotions. We explore the structure of emotions implied by our model\nand compare it to what has been posited in the psychology literature, and validate\nour model on a set of images that have been used in psychology studies. Finally,\nour work also provides a useful tool for the growing academic study of images\u2014\nboth photographs and memes\u2014on social networks.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This work combines words and images from Tumblr to provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis than just positive-negative.

For text processing the authors use a standard LSTM taking as input GLOVE vectors of words in a sentence. For visual information, authors use a pretrained CNN (with fine tuning). A fully connected layer is used to fuse the multimodal information. Experimental results are reported in a self generated data set. \n\nThe contribution from the RL perspective is limited, in the sense that the authors simply applied standard models to predict a bunch of labels (in this case, emotion labels). It is interesting the \"psychological\" analysis that the authors present in Section 6. Still, I think the contribution in that part is a: sentiment-psychologically inspired analysis of the Thumbrl data set. \n\nI think the author's statement on that this study leads to a more plausible psychological model of emotion is not well founded (they also mention to learn to recognize the latent emotional state). Whereas it is true that psychological studies rely on self - filled questionnaires, comparing a questionnaire (produced by expert psychologist) to the tags provided by users in a social network is to ambitious.

The method relies on sentiment pre-processing from GloVe and image pre-processing from Inception.  \n \nMy strongest criticism for this paper is against the claim that Tumblr post represent self-reported emotions and that this method sheds new insight on emotion representation and my secondary criticism is a lack of novelty in the method, which seems to be simply a combination of previously published sentiment analysis module and previously published image analysis module, fused in an output layer. \n\nThe authors claim that the hashtags represent self-reported emotions, but this is not true in the way that psychologists query participants regarding emotion words in psychology studies.  Instead these are emotion words that a person chooses to broadcast along with an associated announcement.  As the authors point out, hashtags and words may be used sarcastically or in different ways from what is understood in emotion theory.  It is quite common for everyday people to use emotion words this way e.g. using #love to express strong approval rather than an actual feeling of love.   \n\nIn their analysis the authors claim:\n\u201cThe 15 emotions retained were those with high relative frequencies on Tumblr among the PANAS-X scale (Watson & Clark, 1999)\u201d.\nHowever five of the words the authors retain: bored, annoyed, love, optimistic, and pensive are not in fact found in the PANAS-X scale:\n\nReference: The PANAS-X Scale: https://wiki.aalto.fi/download/attachments/50102838/PANAS-X-scale_spec.pdf Also the longer version that the authors cited: \nhttps://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/clark/panas-x.pdf\n\nIt should also be noted that the PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Scale) scale and the PANAS-X (the \u201cX\u201d is for eXtended) scale are questionnaires used to elicit from participants feelings of positive and negative affect, they are not collections of \"core\" emotion words, but rather words that are colloquially attached to either positive or negative sentiment.  For example PANAS-X includes words like:\u201cstrong\u201d ,\u201cactive\u201d, \u201chealthy\u201d, \u201csleepy\u201d which are not considered emotion words by psychology.  \n\nIf the authors stated goal is \"different than the standard sentiment analysis goal of predicting whether a sentence expresses positive or negative sentiment\" they should be aware that this is exactly what PANAS is designed to do - not to infer the latent emotional state of a person, except to the extent that their affect is positive or negative.\n\n\nThe work of representing emotions had been an field in psychology for over a hundred years and it is still continuing.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrasting_and_categorization_of_emotions.\n\nOne of the most popular theories of emotion is the theory that there exist \u201cbasic\u201d emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness (enjoyment), Sadness and Surprise (Paul Ekman, cited by the authors).  These are short duration sates lasting only seconds.  They are also fairly specific, for example \u201csurprise\u201d is sudden reaction to something unexpected, which is it exactly the same as seeing a flower on your car and expressing \u201cwhat a nice surprise.\u201d  The surprise would be the initial reaction of \u201cwhat\u2019s that on my car?  Is it dangerous?\u201d but after identifying the object as non-threatening, the emotion of \u201csurprise\u201d would likely pass and be replaced with appreciation.  \n\nThe Circumplex Model of Emotions (Posner et al 2005) the authors refer to actually stands in opposition to the theories of Ekman.  From the cited paper by Posner et al : \n\"The circumplex model of affect proposes that all affective states arise from cognitive interpretations of core neural sensations that are the product of two independent neurophysiological systems. This model stands in contrast to theories of basic emotions, which posit that a discrete and independent neural system subserves every emotion.\"\nFrom my reading of this paper, it is clear to me that the authors do not have a clear understanding of the current state of psychology\u2019s view of emotion representation and this work would not likely contribute to a new understanding of the latent structure of peoples\u2019 emotions.\n\nIn the PCA result, it is not \"clear\" that the first axis represents valence, as \"sad\" has a slight positive on this scale and \"sad\" is one of the emotions most clearly associated with negative valence.\n\nWith respect to the rest of the paper, the level of novelty and impact is \"ok, but not good enough.\"  This analysis does not seem very different from Twitter analysis, because although Tumblr posts are allowed to be longer than Twitter posts, the authors truncate the posts to 50 characters.  Additionally, the images do not seem to add very much to the classification.  The authors algorithm also seems to be essentially a combination of two other, previously published algorithms.\n\nFor me the novelty of this paper was in its application to the realm of emotion theory, but I do not feel there is a contribution here.

As we believe this is by no means a settled field, we see our contribution as that of providing a new measurement tool, more robust than standard sentiment analysis, for the automatic measurement of emotion. We reference both Ekman and the Circumplex model because we see our work as attempting to find evidence, positive or negative, for these theories.

It is quite common for everyday people to use emotion words this way e.g. using #love to express strong approval rather than an actual feeling of love.\u201d\n\nAs we describe in the paper, there is no agreed upon gold-standard for measuring emotion in psychology. Self-report is considered the best, but there can be demand effects (Orne 1962) through which subjects try to tailor their responses in some way due to the fact that they are participating in a study. By contrast, behavioral measures (Webb et al, 1966) can be more reliable as they are less subject to demand effects. We see all of the performance by users on Tumblr as behavioral, with the emotion tags are as a behavioral report of emotion. We agree that there is noise inherent in this measure, due to, e.g. sarcasm, but did not see reason to worry that this was a significant source of bias.\n\n2) \u201cIn their analysis the authors claim:\n\u201cThe 15 emotions retained were those with high relative frequencies on Tumblr among the PANAS-X scale (Watson & Clark, 1999)\u201d.\nHowever five of the words the authors retain: bored, annoyed, love, optimistic, and pensive are not in fact found in the PANAS-X scale:\n\nReference: The PANAS-X Scale: https://wiki.aalto.fi/download/attachments/50102838/PANAS-X-scale_spec.pdf Also the longer version that the authors cited: \nhttps://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/clark/panas-x.pdf\n\nIt should also be noted that the PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Scale) scale and the PANAS-X (the \u201cX\u201d is for eXtended) scale are questionnaires used to elicit from participants feelings of positive and negative affect, they are not collections of \"core\" emotion words, but rather words that are colloquially attached to either positive or negative sentiment.

We extracted as many posts as possible for various emotions and kept the 15 emotions with the highest relative frequencies.

Very simple methods (e.g. LIWC) can do a decent job at this task. But do these methods capture latent emotional state? (Whether this emotional state is conceived of as positive/negative affect, core emotions, or a circumplex model is a separate issue we discuss below). We argue that there is strong evidence that standard sentiment analysis methods do NOT correspond to the latent emotional of the user and have added a citation (Flaxman and Kassam, 2016) backing up this claim.
