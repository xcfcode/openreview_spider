To better understand the transfer of task information, we study an architecture with a shared module for all tasks and a separate output module for each task. We study the theory of this setting on linear and ReLU-activated models. Our key observation is that whether or not tasks' data are well-aligned can significantly affect the performance of multi-task learning. We show that misalignment between task data can cause negative transfer (or hurt performance) and provide sufficient conditions for positive transfer. Inspired by the theoretical insights, we show that aligning tasks' embedding layers leads to performance gains for multi-task training and transfer learning on the GLUE benchmark and sentiment analysis tasks; for example, we obtained a 2.35% GLUE score average improvement on 5 GLUE tasks over BERT LARGE using our alignment method. We also design an SVD-based task re-weighting scheme and show that it improves the robustness of multi-task training on a multi-label image dataset.", "keywords": ["Multi-Task Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "Many existing approaches in multi-task learning rely on intuitions about how to transfer information.

We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s effort to provide detailed comments which we have incorporated in the revision. Here are our changes with respect to each comment.\n\n  > \u201c1. I suggest the author to merge the Figure 3 and Data generation (Page 4) part for a better presentation. e,g which \u201cdiff.covariance\u201d is task 3 or 4?  And why we use different rotation matrix Q_i ?\u201d\n\n    - We have revised Figure 3 and the Data generation paragraph in Sec. 2.3 to clarify the two issues.\n    - Figure 3 is simplified to 2 curves without affecting the message. The caption connects the figure to the generation process. And the generation process is revised accordingly in reference to the figure.\n    - The different rotation matrices Q_i are used to create a \u201ccovariate shift\u201d between the two tasks. As Figure 3 shows, this shift leads to a negative transfer of MTL in the regime where the number of source data points is small.\n\n  > \u201c2. In algorithm 1 (Page 5), I suggest the author use a formal equation (like algorithm 2) instead of descriptive words.\n     -- Step 2, I have trouble in understanding this step.\n     -- Step 3, how to jointly minimize R_1,\\dots, R_k, A_1, \\dots, A_k ? we use loss (3)  or other losses?\n     -- I suggest that the author release the code for a better understanding.\u201d\n\n    - We have revised the description of algorithm 1 to define a formal loss. To minimize the modified loss over the alignment matrices and the output layers, we use standard training procedures (mini-batch SGD, cf. Appendix C.3). Our code will be open-sourced after the reviewing process.\n\n  > \u201c3. For theorem 2, can we find some \u201coptimal\u201d c to optimize the right part ? Since 6c + \\frac{1}{1-3c}\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\X_2\\theta_2} might be further optimized.\u201d\n\n    - The error bound $6c + \\frac{1}{1-3c}\\frac{||\\epsilon||}{||X_2\\theta_2||}$ decreases with c so the smaller c is the better. We have revised Theorem 2 and added a discussion regarding the error bound (Appendix B.2.2).\n\n  > \u201c4. In section 3.3. (Figure 6)  of the real neural network, the model capacity is the dimension of Z or simply the dimension before last fc-layer?\u201d\n\n    - The model capacity is the dimension before the last fc-layer. We have revised this sentence to make it clear.\n\n  > \u201c5. Some parts in the appendix can be better illustrated:\n    (a) I am not clear how proposition 4 can derive proposition 1.\n    (b) Page 15, proving fact 8: last line \\frac{1}{k^4}sin(a^{prime},b^{prime}) should be \\frac{1}{k^4}sin^{2}(a^{prime},b^{prime}).\u201d\n\n    - (a) We have revised proposition 4 so that it becomes more clear that it can derive proposition 1. In particular, proposition 4 states that the subspace of the shared module is all that matters, hence having the $\\{\\theta_i\\}$\u2019s in its column span suffices. Proposition 1 instantiates this intuition.\n    - (b) Thanks for catching the typo. We have fixed it.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #1"}, "SkgiOcavjB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJlRuaviKB", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and for the appreciation of our theoretical contribution and our effort on writing. We respond to the two comments under \u201ccons\u201d here.\n\n  > \u201cThere is not much of novelty in the algorithm and architecture. Their method is very similar to domain adaptation but for multi-learning setting.\u201d\n\n    - We do agree that in domain adaptation, it is well-understood that the divergence between the source and target distributions can cause negative transfer. Hence, the general recipe is to correct this divergence by matching the source distribution to the target. In the multi-task setting, however, the interaction/interference between the tasks is much more complicated, e.g. positive and negative effects can happen at the same time (e.g. figure 6). To determine the type of interference, we provide a theoretical framework to study this question in linear and ReLU models and we develop theory to identify the components which cause positive and negative transfers.\n    - We would like to emphasize that our covariance alignment algorithm and SVD-based reweighing scheme are both consequences derived from our theory. The additional experiments we added into the revision verify that the alignment algorithm can correct misaligned task data for linear models (Appendix C.5), and we have shown that it works well for highly non-linear networks (Sec. 3.2). Our insight for these empirical results is that there exists an alignment matrix that corrects the differences between the task covariances, which can cause negative effect in MTL. We believe that this insight is applicable to more sophisticated architectures.\n    - In addition to the algorithms, our theoretical framework provides some general rules of thumb and tools to help MTL in practice, including i) We show that the capacity of the shared MTL module should not exceed the total capacities of all the STL modules; ii) We propose the cosine similarity score to measure the similarities of task data and track the progress of the alignment procedure.\n\n  > \u201cIn the Theorem 2, they have assumed parameter $c <= 1/3$. They have not provided any insight of how much restrictive this assumption is.\u201d\n\n    - In Theorem 2, the assumption that $c <= 1/3$ arises when we deal with the label noise of task 2. If there is no noise for task 2, then this assumption is not needed. If there is noise for task 2, this assumption is satisfied when $\\sin(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ is less than $1/(3\\kappa(X_2))$. This is satisfied when the two single-task models are close enough, which is intuitively necessary to guarantee positive transfer. Indeed our experiments also show that the value of $\\sin(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ affects performance (Figure 8 and 9 in Appendix C.4).\n    - Theorem 2 guarantees positive transfers in MTL, when the source and target models are close enough and the number of source samples is large. While the intuition is folklore in MTL, we provide a formal justification in the linear and ReLU models to quantify the phenomenon.\n    - We have added these discussions to provide more insight on Theorem 2 into the revision in Appendix B.2.2.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #3"}, "r1x_6VTwsS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJeNT1T3YH", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for appreciating the contribution of our work, and we are grateful to the suggestions which help improve our work. We added experiments to evaluate our method on linear and ReLU models regarding the suggested gap between our theory and the experiments. We added the related work [1] and provided comparative experiments with [1]. We addressed the parts that are confusing as suggested. Here are our responses regarding each comment.\n\nResponse to major comments:\n\n  > \u201cOne issue with the submission is that there is a significant gap between the theory and experimental sections as theory only covers linear models and the experiments don\u2019t include linear models and purely focus on deep networks.\u201d\n\n    - We have added experiments to evaluate our alignment method (Alg 1) on linear and ReLU-activated models for synthetic data (Appendix C.4). Our method can indeed help these models in addition to deep networks.\n\n  > \u201cAdditional assumptions (1D labels, same input dimensionality across all tasks) should be emphasised to clarify limitations of all derivations.\u201d\n\n    - We have revised Sec. 2.1 to emphasize that the labels are 1D in our model (the same input dimensionality assumption is also stated in Sec. 2.1). A multi-label problem with k types of labels can be modeled by k tasks with the same covariates but different labels.\n\n  > \u201cWhere previous work addressed model similarity it often looks at models in the context of existing datasets (i.e. taking the data into account to describe boundaries etc) such that the emphasised novelty at looking at data similarity is to be taken with a grain of salt.\u201d\n\n    - We agree that if we compare two task models trained from the datasets, their similarity already depends on the data. In our experience in looking at LSTM/CNN/MLP models on sentiment analysis, however, we have observed that just measuring the similarity of the model weights or feature outputs is too crude to tell whether or not MTL shows positive or negative benefit, even for a single layer. This is likely due to the differences between the task data and the specific model used. And there is currently no theoretical framework to answer this question.\n    - To provide a more precise answer, we formulate this question in a simple setup. Our theory disentangles the model part and the data part. By doing so, figure 2 shows that task data similarity plays a second-order effect after controlling model similarity to be the same. Our intuition is that this arises from the shift of the covariance matrices between the task data. Our theory formalizes the covariances and our experiments show the benefit of aligning the covariance matrices on deep networks.\n    - We have revised the third paragraph in the intro to make it more clear.\n \n  > \u201cWhile the model with non-linear activation is mentioned at places, nearly all theorems rely on the linear model instead such that it might make sense to either work towards generalising the theorems or emphasising that most only apply to linear models.\u201d\n\n    - We thank Reviewer 2 for pointing these out. We have extended the theoretical result of Sec. 2.2 so that it applies to ReLU settings. The theoretical result of section 2.3 also applies to ReLU settings. So the only result which does not apply to the ReLU setting is proposition 3 in Sec. 2.4. The question of characterizing the optimization landscape in non-linear ReLU models is not well-understood based on the current theoretical understanding of neural networks. We think this is an open research direction and we have stated this question in the revised version.\n\nResponse to minor comments:\n\n  > \u201cy is used as label and as data terminology at different parts of the text\u201d\n\n    - Thanks for pointing out this issue. We have corrected the use of y in the revision.\n\n  > \u201cthe model in the first set of experiments has lower capacity than most models individually, suggesting that the capacity should be smaller even for individual tasks to prevent overfitting. An ablation over model capacities is mentioned but missing for 3.3\u201d\n\n    - We have added an ablation study over model capacities to show the performance of MTL and STL as we vary the capacities (Appendix C.5). This indicates the best performing capacities we choose in Figure 6. We also added plots on CNN/MLP to show the same results.\n\n  > \u201ccomparison against existing multitask loss weighting techniques should be performed [1]\u201d\n\n    - Thanks for pointing out this work. We have compared our method (Alg 1) to the techniques in [1]. This is added as a benchmark in Sec. 3.1. Our SVD-based scheme performs favorably on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. The results are in Sec. 3.2 and ablation results are in Sec. 3.3 and Appendix C.5.
