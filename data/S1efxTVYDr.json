However, MLE focuses on once-to-all matching between the predicted sequence and gold-standard, consequently treating all incorrect predictions as being equally incorrect. We refer to this drawback as {\\it negative diversity ignorance} in this paper. Treating all incorrect predictions as equal unfairly downplays the nuance of these sequences' detailed token-wise structure. To counteract this, we augment the MLE loss by introducing an extra Kullback--Leibler divergence term derived by comparing a data-dependent Gaussian prior and the detailed training prediction. The proposed data-dependent Gaussian prior objective (D2GPo) is defined over a prior topological order of tokens and is poles apart from the data-independent Gaussian prior (L2 regularization) commonly adopted in smoothing the training of MLE. Experimental results show that the proposed method makes effective use of a more detailed prior in the data and has improved performance in typical language generation tasks, including supervised and unsupervised machine translation, text summarization, storytelling, and image captioning.\n", "keywords": ["Gaussian Prior Objective", "Language Generation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Talk)", "comment": "This paper addresses the problem of poor generation quality in models for text generation that results from the use of the maximum likelihood (ML) loss, in particular the fact that the ML loss does not differentiate between different \"incorrect\" generated outputs (ones that do not match the corresponding training sequence).  The authors propose to train text generation models with an additional loss term that measures the distance from the ground truth via a Gaussian distribution based on embeddings of the ground-truth tokens.  This is not the first attempt to address drawbacks of ML training for text generation, but it is simple and intuitive, and produces improvements over the state of the art on a range of tasks.

If it is a hyperparameter, the sensitivity of different deviations for the performance should be experimentally reported. A small valued deviation would make the KL divergence close to zero, while a large one makes its convergence slow.\n- Another way to remedy the problem of KL divergence above is applying Wasserstein distance instead of KL divergence.

The proposed objective is simple to implement and can easily be added on top of a regular cross-entropy loss. The paper shows that the new objective shows consistent improvements across a wide range of tasks.\n\n- Something that perturbed me a lot when reading Section 4, is that the function f should take as input 2 arguments, and not just 1. Typically, in Equation 7, from what I understand the numerator should be exp(f(y'_i, y_i)/T), and the denominator the sum over the exp(f(y'_j, y_i)/T). In other words, the value of f assigns a score to a word y'_j which depends on the target word y_i. This is also what suggests Figure 1: f depends on the target word. I think this should really be clarified in the paper, and f needs to be defined formally. In Figure 1, what is the exact value of f when the model outputs \"armchair\" / when the model outputs \"armchairs\". If I did not understand correctly, please point me out.\n\n- The cross-entropy loss in a generative model is essentially the KL divergence loss KL(Q, P) where Q is the true distribution (i.e. a one-hot vector) and P is the model output. In Equation 7, when T -> 0, the distribution Q becomes this one-hot vector. In that case, from what I understand, the D2GPo objective is actually very similar to the initial MLE objective, except that you compute KL(P, Q) instead of KL(Q, P), and that Q is not exactly one-hot because you consider a T > 0. Can you confirm this? Also, any reason why you considered KL(P, Q) instead of KL(Q, P)?\n\n- What value did you use for the temperature T? Did you study its impact?\n\n- Same question for lambda in Equation 6, what is the value you considered, and did you study its impact?\n\n- As mentioned in the introduction of the paper, one drawback with traditional neural generative, is the generation diversity, i.e. the fact that generations are generic, and an easy way to see this is to observe that generations are mostly composed of the most frequent words in the vocabulary. Did you evaluate whether a model trained with D2GPo has more diversity, and is more likely to generate rare words compared to a regular model trained with MLE only?\n\n- Figure 1 in the appendix is helpful. It would be nice to move it to Section 4.\n\n- In the related work, you write \"the Transformer provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies\", which sounds a bit odd. There is no explicit memory component in the transformer, the ability to handle long-term dependencies comes instead from the self-attention mechanism.\n\nOverall the paper tackles an interesting problem which I feel has received surprisingly little attention from the community. The paper is well written, and has a lot of experiments supporting the method. But I think Section 4 needs to be clarified, and some experimental details are missing.

Please see our response below.\n\n1. About the incomplete definition problem.\n \nWe are sorry for the reading discomfort caused by incomplete definition. Exactly, function f should take 2 arguments as input. When we wrote this expression, we focused on the situation given by y_i, so we made an incomplete expression. Thank you for your suggestion. We have modified this expression and formally define function f.\n \n2. About the KL divergence item.\n \nThis is a writing error, which we have fixed in this version. In machine learning, p is the distribution of real labels, and q is the distribution of predicted labels. While in this paper, p represents the predicted distribution of the model, q represents a real label distribution, so this error is caused. In the implementation, we use torch.nn.KLDivLoss()(input=p, target=q).\n \n3. About the standard deviation (\\lambda) and temperature T.\n \nIn the experiments of this paper, we used the standard deviation of the KL diversity item  $\\lambda$=0.1 and temperature  T=2.0. We have studied the influence of different values on the experimental performance on the supervised NMT EN-DE transformer-base model. The results are shown in Appendix A.7.\n \n4. About generation diversity.\n \nWe did a statistic on the generations and references (see Appendix A.9). According to the results, more low-frequency words were predicted. Therefore, we have a reason to believe that a model trained with D2GPo has more diversity, and is more likely to generate rare words compared to a regular model trained with MLE only.\n \n5.

What the intention is to express is that Transformer provides a better memory representation than RNN (relying on self-attention to extract implicit memory instead of an explicit memory component). In our updated version, we have removed these misleading words.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #1"}, "HkgSXP8FiB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hkx6OwB0YB", "comment": "Thanks so much for your constructive reviews. Please see our response below.\n \n1. About the reference to the related paper.\n \nThe paper \"Neural Text Generation with Unlikelihood Training\" proposes a new objective, unlikelihood training, which forces unlikely generations to be assigned lower probability by the model. The paper claims that the likelihood objective itself is at fault, resulting in a model that assigns too much probability to sequences containing repeats and frequent words, unlike those from the human training distribution.  From this point of view, there are some similar points with our motivation, which are to some extent to make the model prediction consistent with human training distribution. The difference is that this paper focuses on low-frequency words, while our model focuses on negative tokens. Although from the final results, our model also reduces the prediction problem of low-frequency words. Therefore, these two works have some common ground, but there are also big differences. We have added a discussion to this paper in related work.\n \n2. About the criticisms.\n \nThank you for your valuable suggestions. We will revise the next version according to your suggestions due to the limited time in the rebuttal period.\n \n3. About the question on off-the-shelf fastText embeddings.\n \nYes, the off-the-shelf fastText embeddings work well for our proposed method. In our D2GPo for image captioning experiment, the off-the-shelf fastText embedding pretrained by Facebook \\url{https://fasttext.cc/} is used due to the image captioning baseline system is performed on word-level. For other tasks, the reason why the off-the-shelf pretrained embedding is not used is that other tasks are based on the subword level, and the BPE codes for different experimental settings are different, resulting in the inconsistency of subword grain and vocabulary. Therefore, we pretrained the embedding on the training data (after BPE) to ensure the consistency of vocabulary (fastText embedding and model). However, we are also working to solve this problem. By modifying fasText's training objective, n-gram characters are not only used as feature input, but also as prediction objective. In this way, we hope to solve the problem of embedding input for different subword grain in the future.\n \n4. About the question on the performance gain with D2GPo vary based on the number of training examples.\n\n \nThank you for your reminding, we have added the experiment (see Appendix A.8) of the low resource setting of supervised NMT EN-RO during rebuttal. We sampled 10K, 100K, 600K paired sentences from the bilingual training data of WMT16 English-Romanian to explore the performance of our method in different low-resource scenarios. We used the same BPE codes learned in the pre-trained stage to tokenize the training sentence pairs and the same fastText subword embedding pretrained using all the 600K training data. The results show that too little training data is not enough to train a robust model. In this case, the injection of prior knowledge can help to train the parameters of the model and substantially improve the translation performance. However, with the increase of training data, the model itself can be optimized well, and the improvement by introducing prior knowledge is not as substantial as before.\n \n5. About the question on generation quality and failure modes.\n\nWe have made some observations on the generated text, but it's hard to say whether we can see the generation quality has changed directly, which is very subjective. As you said, our model will encourage negative diversity, so there must be some failure modes due to incorrect or even opposite tokens have similar fastText embedding. Therefore, we did a statistic on the generations and references (see Appendix A.9). In this statistic, we filtered low-frequency words in the training set and counted them in the generations and reference, and the results showed that more low-frequency words were predicted. Therefore, we have reason to believe that part of the improvements comes from the diversity brought by D2GPo.\n \n6. About the technique question.\n\nWe used the pretrained neural network weights provided by MASS and then used back translation to train the unsupervised NMT model. The training data and BPE code are consistent with MASS. At present, our D2GPo was only used in the back translation training phase. Because we don't have enough computation resources and time to replicate MASS's unsupervised NMT experiments, we reported his results directly. As for whether D2GPo is useful in the pretraining phase, we are trying to re-pretrain MASS. If there is an updated result, we will report it in the next version.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #3"}, "r1griLLtjH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1gsgn90YB", "comment": "Thanks so much for your constructive reviews. Please see our response below.\n\n1. About the standard deviation (\\lambda).\n \nWe define the standard deviation of the KL diversity item as a hyperparameter, which is set to 0.1 in all experiments in this paper. We have studied the influence of different values on the experimental performance on the supervised NMT EN-DE transformer-base model. The results are shown in Appendix A.7. The experimental results show that the setting of  $\\lamda$ will affect the training process of the model. If it is too large, the model will have more uncertainty and reduce the performance of the model. If it is too small, the enhancement effect is not obvious.\n \n2. About the \"distance\" (difference) measure of distributions: f-divergence vs. Optimal Transport.\n \nThere are two common ways to measure the distance between two distributions: f-divergence and Optimal Transport (OT). KL diversity is one of the f-divergence, and OT distance is also known as Wasserstein distance. \n \nOT is weaker than f-divergence in topology, which is very important in the generation model. Because the support set of data is often a low-dimensional manifold in the input space, there is probably no overlap between the real distribution and the generated distribution, resulting in the failure of the f-divergence due to it is a distance measure to capture the probability density ratio of distributions. \n \nBack to our work, the generation distribution of the model and the prior distribution of the data are defined on the same support set (i.e., vocabulary), so KL divergence is applicable. \n\nIn our work, we fix the shape of the prior distribution, so we can use a more simple and intuitive distance measurement. In spite of this, we also try to implement the Wasserstein distance on our proposed D2GPo and used Sinkhorn Iteration to solve the problem. However, it is found that it is not suitable for language generation tasks due to the need to calculate the cost matrix. Suppose that for a batch, the size of the batch is B, the sequence length is S, and the vocabulary size is L, then for a batch, the target probability distribution size is (B x S) x L, and the cost matrix is (B x S) x L x L. For the language generation tasks, the target vocabulary is generally large (in supervised NMT EN-DE, the vocabulary size is 43640). In my preliminary experiment, the model tried to apply for 1783.30 GiB memory in the cost matrix calculation operation, so it is not feasible.\n \n3.

The prior penalizes incorrect generations/predictions when they are close to the reference; thus, in contrast with standard MLE alone, the training objective does not equally penalize all incorrect predictions. For the experiments, the authors use cosine similarity between fastText embeddings to determine the similarity of a predicted word and the target word. The method is tested on a comprehensive set of text generation tasks: machine translation, unsupervised machine translation, summarization, storytelling, and image captioning. In all cases, simply adding the proposed prior improves over a state-of-the-art model. The results are remarkable, as the proposed prior is useful despite the variety of architectures, tasks (including multi-modal ones), and models with/without pre-training.\n\nIn general, it is promising to pursue work in altering the standard MLE objective; changes to learning objective seem orthogonal to the modeling gains made in many papers (as evidenced by the gains the authors show across diverse models). This paper opens up several new directions, i.e., how can we impose even more effective priors? The authors show that it's effective to use a relatively simple fastText-based prior, but it's possible to consider other priors based on large-scale pre-trained language models or learned models. In this vein, a concurrent paper \"Neural Text Generation with Unlikelihood Training\" has also shown it effective to alter the standard MLE objective. I think it would be nice to discuss this paper and related works. Overall, I think the approach is quite general and elegant.\n\nMy main criticism is that the writing was unfocused or unclear at times. The intro discusses a variety of problems in generation, before explaining that the authors only intend to tackle one (\"negative diversity ignorance\"). It would have been more helpful to read more text in the intro that motivated the problem of negative diversity ignorance and the proposed solution. The second paragraph in the Discussion in Section 4 is rather ambiguous and hand-wavy. It would be nice to see the authors' intuition described more rigorously (i.e., explicitly describing in math how the cosine similarity score is used in the Gaussian prior, or describing in math how the central limit theorem is used). Some of the existing mathematical explanation in section 4 could be made simpler or more clear (the description of f(y) seems to be a distraction since it doesn't end up in the final loss).\n\nI would have also appreciated more analysis. After reading the paper, I have the following questions (which the authors may be able to address in the rebuttal):\n* Do off-the-shelf fastText embeddings work well? How important is it to train fastText embeddings on the data itself? If off-the-shelf embeddings worked well, that could make the method easier to use for others in practice.\n* How does the gain in performance with D2GPo vary based on the number of training examples? Priors are generally more helpful in low-data regimes. If that is the case here as well, you might get even more compelling results on low-data tasks (all tasks attempted here are somewhat large-scale, as I understand)\n* Qualitatively, do you notice any difference in the generations? How does the model make mistakes (are these more \"semantic\" somehow, i.e. swapping a different synonym in). Perhaps the gaussian prior has some failure modes, i.e., where it increases the probability of very incorrect/opposite words because they have a similar fastText representation. These kinds of intuitions would be useful to know\n\nI also have one technical question:\n* When you compare against MASS (Song et al. 2019), do you use the same code and/or pre-trained weights from MASS, or do you pre-train from scratch using the procedure from MASS? (The wording in the text is somewhat ambiguous.) I'm just wondering how comparable the results are vs. MASS, or if it would be useful to know how your version of the pre-trained model does.\n\n\nDespite my above questions/concerns, I think the proposed method or its predecessors could provide improvements across a variety of text generation tasks, so I overall highly recommend this paper for acceptance.\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "8: Accept", "confidence": 3}}}
