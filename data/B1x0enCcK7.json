We propose an automated method for generating object shapes with desired affordances, based on neural networks.", "abstract": "3D objects (artefacts) are made to fulfill functions. Designing an object often starts with defining a list of functionalities that it should provide, also known as functional requirements. Today, the design of 3D object models is still a slow and largely artisanal activity, with few Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools existing to aid the exploration of the design solution space. The purpose of the study is to explore the possibility of shape generation conditioned on desired functionalities. To accelerate the design process, we introduce an algorithm for generating object shapes with desired functionalities. We follow the principle form follows function, and assume that the form of a structure is correlated to its function. First, we use an artificial neural network to learn a function-to-form mapping by analysing a dataset of objects labeled with their functionalities. Then, we combine forms providing one or more desired functions, generating an object shape that is expected to provide all of them. Finally, we verify in simulation whether the generated object possesses the desired functionalities, by defining and executing functionality tests on it.", "keywords": ["automated design", "affordance learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper presents a novel problem formulation, that of generating 3D object shapes based on their functionality. They use a dataset of 3d shapes annotated with functionalities to learn a voxel generative network that conditions on the desired functionality to generate a voxel occupancy grid. However, the fact that the results are not very convincing -resulting 3D shapes are very coarse- raises questions regarding the usefulness of the proposed problem formulation. \nThus, the problem formulation novelty alone is not enough for acceptance. Combined with a motivating application to demonstrate the usefulness of the problem formulation and results, would make this paper a much stronger submission. Furthermore, the authors have greatly improved the writing of the manuscript during the discussion phase."}, "review": {"SyeGKeoanX": {"type": "review", "replyto": "B1x0enCcK7", "review": "This paper is addressing several research challenges as a method to generate objects with desired functionalities, a method to extract form-to-function mapping, a method to operationally support a functionality arithmetic. The work illustrated in this paper is really interesting and is addressing relevant and open problems in the domain of product design.\n\nNevertheless the manuscript has a couple of weaknesses, one concerned with the presentation and another related to the design of the study. \n\nThe lack of a consistent choice for the lexicon is sometimes misleading. It is not always clear whether the use of different terms is addressing synonyms or to discriminate between two distinct concepts. For example let consider the following pairs: functionality versus affordance, function versus functional, class versus category, feature versus shape. \n\nThe study addresses several questions. Not always is clear what is the purpose or better the research questions that are driving the design of the experiments. While in the manuscript the are many repetition of the objectives of the study, less attention is devoted to explain what are the working hypothesis underlying the proposed methods. For example, one of the objective is a method to generate objects with desired functionalities. Only in the final Section there is a brief mention of the dichotomy between meash-based versus voxel-based. As reported in Section 2 there are in literature other works but there is not a claim on what is the specific purpose of the present study. The contrast of voxel versus mesh looks like a motivation but it only a speculation. A similar comment might address the dichotomy deterministic (ontology) versus probabilistic (autoencoder). In this case the experiment design should provide some empirical evidence about this contrast.\n\nA minor comment. Figure 7a is illustrating the functional essence of table. According to the caption Figure 5a is illustrating the same functional essence for the same category/class table. Should the pictures look the same? \n", "title": "Interesting work that would deserve a better focus of experiment design", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "rJxXwY25nX": {"type": "review", "replyto": "B1x0enCcK7", "review": "\nThis paper proposed a 3D shape generation model. The model is essentially an auto-encoder. The authors explored a new way of interpolation among encoded latent vectors, and drew connections to object functionality.\n\nThe paper is, unfortunately, clearly below the bar of ICLR in many ways. It\u2019s technically incremental: the paper doesn\u2019t propose a new model; it instead suggests new way of interpolating the latent vectors for shape generation. The incremental technical innovation is not well-motivated or justified, either: the definitions of new concepts such as \u2018functional essence\u2019 and \u2018importance vector\u2019 are ad-hoc. The results are poor, much worse compared with the state-of-the-art shape synthesis methods. The writing and organization can also be improved. For example, the main idea should be emphasized first in the method section, and the detailed network architecture can be saved for a separate subsection or supplementary material. \n\nIt\u2019s good that the authors are looking into the direction of modeling shape functionality. This is an importance area that is currently less explored. I suggest the authors look into the rich literature of geometry modeling in the computer graphics and vision community, and improve the paper by drawing inspiration from the latest progress there. \n", "title": "An ad-hoc method for shape generation", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "H1eIA9Eqhm": {"type": "review", "replyto": "B1x0enCcK7", "review": "This paper presents a method for generating 3D objects. They train a VAE to generate voxel occupancy grids.

The method is described in too much detail, and the extra length (10 pages) is unnecessary. Cross entropy, VAEs, and many of the CNN details can usually just be cited, instead of being described to the reader.\n\n- The paper uses suggestive terminology, like \"functional essence\" and \"functional arithmetic\" for concepts that are fairly mundane (see Lipton and Steinhardt, 2018 for an extended discussion of this issue). For example, the \"functional essence\" of a class is essentially an average of the VAE latent vectors (Section 3.3.1). The paper claims, without sufficient explanation, that this is computation is motivated by the idea that \"form follows function\".\n\n- The results are not very impressive. There is no rigorous evaluation. They propose several nice metrics to use (eg. affordance simulation), but the results they present for each metric are quite limited. The qualitative results are also not particularly compelling.\n\n- The paper should more thoroughly evaluate the importance weighting that is described in Section 3.3.2.\n\n - The technical approach (combining VAE vectors to make new shapes) is not particularly novel[\n\nOverall:\n\nThe paper should not be accepted in its current form, both due to the confusing writing, and the lack of careful evaluation.\n", "title": "Cool idea, but not well written, and not sufficiently evaluated", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}}}
