The sample complexity of existing methods is high and depends on problem dimensionality, unlike the dimensionality-independent rates of first-order methods.

We therefore consider derivative-free optimization of a high-dimensional function that lies on a latent low-dimensional manifold. We develop an online learning approach that learns this manifold while performing the optimization. In other words, we jointly learn the manifold and optimize the function.

The authors develop an online learning framework which jointly learns the nonlinear manifold and solves the optimization. Moreover, the authors present a bound on the convergence rate of their algorithm which improves the sample complexity upon vanilla random search. The paper is overall well written and the core idea seems interesting. However, the reviewer has a few concerns which needs to be addressed. \n \n1) Methodology: This work depends on deep networks to learn the nonlinear manifolds which is justifiable by the power of deep nets. However, several issues may arise.\n\n1.1)  Globally optimizing the loss function of a deep network is no easy task and according to the authors, their theoretical results holds only if equation (6)--which includes the loss function of a deep net-- is globally optimized. \n\n1.2) Even if one could globally minimize the loss function up to a tolerance, this will require a large number of epochs resulting in a high overhead cost for each update of the algorithm. This cost should be considered during the evaluation of the performance of the algorithm. \n\n1.3) Finally, although the authors mention that : \" Experimental results suggest that neural networks can easily fit any training data\", the success of neural networks highly depends on their architecture and carefully tuning their several hyperparameters including the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes in each such layer, the choice of activation function, the choice of optimization method, learning rate, momentum, dropout rate, data-augmentation parameters, etc. One evidence around the necessity of carefully tuning the neural networks lies in appendix B where the authors mention their specific choice of hyperparameters for each experiment as well as the cross validation range they have used. Again, the overhead cost of finding a good deep network through cross-validation or any other method of choice (such as Bayesian optimization or Hyperband) should be considered towards the total cost of the algorithm.\n\n* Note that complex nonlinear manifolds might be better captured by complex yet flexible architecture as the authors also state that: \"If the function of interest is known to be translation invariant, convolutional networks could be deployed to represent the underlying manifold structure\". Hence, a simple fully connected network with fixed hyperparameters is suboptimal in capturing the different manifolds over various problems. This highlights the importance of exploring the space of hyperparameters.\n\n2) Experiments: The results are reported solely over the number of episodes (function evaluations) while the cost of each episode might be significantly different among different methods. Thus, for a thorough examination, reporting the performance over wall-clock time is recommended and required, ideally in both serial and parallel settings . It does not matter whether the time is spent for a function evaluation or for reasoning about the manifold through training the deep network, it should be taken into account.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n1.

We address the concerns as follows.\n\nQ: \u201cHow feasible is to expect the availability of the domain knowledge? ... downsides of the proposed method if the domain knowledge is not available, and a possible strategy to overcome the same.\u201d\n\nA: The specific form of domain knowledge we need is an architectural specification and the fact that the problem lies in some low-dimensional manifold. If any of the deep learning/representation learning methods have already been utilized for the domain, this domain knowledge typically already exist. We believe there are a large number of such domains for our method to be impactful. If such knowledge does not exist, we expect our method to perform the same as the original random search.\n\n\nQ: Is there any motivating reason to stick to the random search methods?\n\nA: The main reason for sticking to random search is existing literature (e.g., Mania 2018, Vemula 2019) showing their practicality for the problems of our interest. For example, they perform well for model-free learning of continuous control of a robot.

(like high dimension Bayesian optimisation).\u201d\n\nA: We added an additional comparison to Bayesian optimization. We chose the REMBO optimizer as it can scale to very high-dimensional spaces. Our results suggest that Bayesian optimization fails for continuous control problems on MuJoCo, and we discuss possible reasons in Section 5.1.

Can we think of any relation with standard metrics like simple regret or cumulative regret that are used to measure the optimisation performance?\n\nA: We reworded the explanation of performance profiles as it was somewhat confusing. We do not choose the Tau. It is the x-axis of the performance profile.

But according to the initial claim, method was supposed to work better in low dimensional problems. Is it because of the fact that the problem space is not drawn from high dimensional data distributions? \n\nA: Our method is best suited for high-dimensional problems lying in a low-dimensional manifold.

The ratio of improvement is between 1.7 and 3.7 times, and the trend seems not exactly to follow dimensionality.

However, we clarify the following points: 1) Our theoretical results only need eq (6) to be minimized over the observed data points. In supervised learning terms, we only need training error to be low, which is a relatively easier task. 2) Our empirical results suggest that a simple optimizer (a few iterations of SGD) typically suffices for all the problems we tried. 3) The optimization theory of NNs is an active research area, and with a better understanding, our proposed method can further be improved in the future.\n\nQ: 1.2 \u201cEven if one could globally minimize the loss function up to a tolerance, this will require a large number of epochs resulting in a high overhead cost\u201d\n\nA: For practical implementation, we only performed very few iterations of SGD (less than 10) at each step.

However, we disagree that these choices need to be searched entirely. For many interesting domains (any domain in which deep learning has been applied to), some of these architectural choices are part of the domain knowledge. For example, we did NOT perform any search over architecture.

To do this, we tie some hyper-parameters of our method to existing hyper-parameters. For example, the manifold dimension is set to be the same as the number of directions parameter in ARS (we denote this as $n=k$ in Appendix B). Moreover, we use a single regularizer multiplier ($\\lambda$) in all experiments and keep the manifold learning rate the same. Quantitatively, the cardinality of the hyper-parameter space for ARS is 735 for MuJoCo and 256 for other problems. The cardinality of the hyper-parameter space for our method is 780 for MuJoCo and 256 for other problems.

The larger the problem, the longer it takes to perform a single iteration.  I believe the main reason why many people use deep reinforcement learning to solve their problems is due to its dimension-independence.  I am not aware of a paper that tries to minimize the sample complexity. Thus, I think the idea in this paper is novel and may have influence on the literature (maybe an encouragement for a shift from deep reinforcement learning to derivative-free optimization methods). \n\nIn terms of presented results I think that there is not much that they could do wrong. They show in Figure 1 that the reward they achieved with their method is only outperformed by Augmented Random Search (ARS) on the Ant task. On all other tasks, their method at least performs on par with ARS which is a good result.\n\nIn Table 1 they show the number of episodes that are needed to achieve the reward threshold. Their method required less episodes than all other methods, but I think this is not the only criteria they should have looked at. So, it might be the case that their iterations take longer to compute than the iterations of the ARS and thereby making it slower. \n\nThe authors have showed that their method has a lower sample complexity, which is their goal of the research (\u201cOur major objective is to improve the sample efficiency of random search.\u201d). However, I am not sure whether this means that it also has a lower computational complexity. They address this issue briefly by stating that \u201cOur method increases the amount of computation since we need to learn a model while performing the optimization. However, in DFO, the major computational bottleneck is typically the function evaluation. When efficiently implemented on a GPU, total time spent on learning the manifold is negligible in comparison to function evaluations.\u201d This would mean that their iterations are performed in less computation time than the ARS, but I would have personally liked to see a number attached to this. \nIf we thus assume that this is the case, then their results are sound. However, I do not see this reduced complexity reflected in the results. If I look at the ratios between the number of episodes it takes to solve the tasks, they seem to be similar to the ones from the ARS. The number of episodes reduces by roughly 50% for all tasks but this keeps the ratio between the different tasks identical. I would have assumed that the ratios would increase in the favor of the larger problems like the Humanoid task. In other words, I still see the influence of the larger dimension in the results. Maybe I am too critical, but to me if they would have just found a faster method without the reduced sample complexity, they would have achieved similar results. \n\nOf course, this problem would not be present if the computation time increases with the number of iterations. In that case, the computation time would not reduce by a \u201cfixed\u201d ratio and would therefore decrease relatively much on the tasks with a higher dimension.
