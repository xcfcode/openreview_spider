I still doubt the motivation of this paper and the actual experimental performance compared with state-of-the-art methods are still ignored. Thus I decrease my score.\n\n[Original reviews]\nThis paper proposed to modeling image as the combination of a GAN with a Deep Decoder, to remove the representation error of a GAN when used as a prior in inverse problems. The proposed methods are evaluated on two image restoration tasks, including compressive sensing and image super-resolution. The effectiveness of the combination is also presented.\n\nAuthors devote themselves to remove the representation error of the GAN image prior. Intuitively, the manner of the proposed linear combination model is rough and less reasonable. In Alg.1, the detailed algorithmic process is presented, it is clear that authors need to pre-train the used GAN and Deep Decoder, then combine them to train one network. If the motivation of this paper is to remove the representation error of GAN, GAN should be viewed as the main body. However, the authors view GAN and Deep Decoder as the same position against the original intention.\n\nAdditionally, in the experimental part, the ablation studies indeed reflect the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, but it looks like the Deep Decoder plays a key role in all cases. In other words, the GAN image prior just plays a supporting role. This is also far away from motivation.\n\nMore importantly, I cannot see the surprising results because of this work only compare themselves with some basic version or na\u00efve methods. All state-of-the-art approaches to different tasks are ignored, which is the other big disadvantage. \n\nIn Table 2, what is the meaning of \u2018CSGM\u2019\uff1f The authors should describe it.\n\nIn a word, from the algorithmic and experimental perspective, this paper cannot achieve satisfying performance.\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "1: Reject", "confidence": 4}, "H1evWKPssB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJgwdLAaKr", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and corrections. We have updated table 2 to use \"GAN\" instead of \"CSGM\" to reflect that the value for that column represents the dimensionality of each GAN Prior's latent representation.\n\nIn response to your comments about the motivation of our model: our goal in this paper is to propose a simple model which can leverage benefits from a GAN Prior's learned approximation of the data distribution, without being tied to that distribution. The dependence of a GAN prior on its data distribution is a significant flaw, where we would ideally like to have strictly improved performance given examples of the class of images being recovered.\n\nSo, it is intentional that the GAN only plays a supporting role, for those images where is has learned useful representations.\n\nWe demonstrate that our model significantly reduces the representation error of the GAN, and comparisons to the Deep Decoder only indicate that the GAN Prior contributes its own benefits where it is possible. On out of distribution images, it is expected that the GAN Prior would be useless \u2013 our model is robust to this failure.\n\nWe appreciate your comments and look forward to improving this method further.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer 1"}, "B1e9ROPooS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJlxZVMlqr", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and corrections. We have updated the paper with a diagram of our model, and moved the hyperparameter descriptions to a section of the appendix. \n\nOur intention in the superresolution section is to demonstrate that our hybrid model is applicable for inverse problems besides compressed sensing. However, we agree with your concerns that improvement of the hybrid model over the deep decoder is not very significant. Since we already demonstrate that the hybrid model is no worse than a deep decoder via the out of distribution experiments, we have decided to remove the superresolution section from the paper.\n\nIn response to your concerns about n_pre, we observed that when n_pre is set to zero, there is some variance in the experimental results. The intuition is that both the GAN and Deep Decoder are randomly initialized, and so they can interfere with each other early in the inversion procedure. The results are otherwise not sensitive to choice of n_pre (within the same order of magnitude)", "title": "Response to Reviewer 3"}, "Sklns_wsir": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rkxEiTqbqB", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and corrections.

Anecdotally, we observe the invertible models perform significantly better (4-6 dB psnr) in most measurement regimes (> 2% measurement ratio). The improvement is slightly less for lower measurement ratios (1-2 db psnr). This comes at a cost of significantly more expensive inversion, and a larger representation size. \n2.

The combined model jointly infers the latent code for the trained GAN and the parameters in the untrained deep decoder. It also jointly infers the mixing coefficient alpha and beta during test time for each image, thus learning how much we should rely on GAN. The proposed hybrid model is helpful on compressed sensing experiments on the CelebA dataset; however, it is only marginally better than deep decoder on image super resolution and out-of-distribution compressed sensing.\n\nDetailed comments:\n-\tThe writing is clear and I was able to understand the model part of the paper. The algorithm box is helpful. However, I would still appreciate if the authors can provide an overall model figure in the model section to help understanding. \n-\tJointly learning the mixing coefficient is an interesting part of the model.\n-\tThe motivation in the abstract and intro could be strengthened. A smaller version of Figure 1 can be probably moved to the beginning of the paper to illustrate the problem of GAN. But even with the help of Figure 1, it is still unclear what is the fundamental problem for GAN. Simply combining a GAN with an untrained decoder model doesn\u2019t help elucidate the source of the problem. \n-\tThe proposed Hybrid model seems to help on compressed sensing experiments on CelebA. However, it doesn\u2019t help much on out-of-distribution experiments. Moreover, in the super-resolution task, as shown in Figure 5, the improvement over deep decoder is also not significant.\n-\tThe out-of-distribution experiments seems lack of thorough study. In particular, the paper only studies the transfer between CelebA -> Caltech-UCSD Bird dataset. It would be better if the paper can study a variety of other image datasets as well. Also some visualization on the Bird dataset should also be included.\n-\tEffect of n_pre needs to be further investigated. Why not directly train both models together? It would be good if the authors could comment on how sensitive the n_pre is and what is the intuition.\n-\tFor figures, I would recommend rename \u201cHybrid\u201d to \u201cHybrid (Ours)\u201d to highlight the paper\u2019s contribution, and use a brighter color.\n-\tFigure 5 should be renamed as a Table. \n-\tHyperparameter details should be moved to the Experiment section.\n\nConclusion:\nThe paper proposes a simple combination of a trained GAN and an untrained decoder model for the task of image restoration. Although the method is clear and straightforward, in the experiments, the influence of the new model component seems marginal. Moreover, the motivation is not strong enough.
