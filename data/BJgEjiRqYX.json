In this work we propose to structure the generator of a GAN to consider objects and their relations explicitly, and generate images by means of composition. This provides a way to efficiently learn a more accurate generative model of real-world images, and serves as an initial step towards learning corresponding object representations.

Whereas prior work has focused primarily on the representation learning part (eg. [3, 4, 5]), here our focus is on scaling these ideas to more complex datasets. In particular, among the multi-object datasets considered in relevant prior work are Multi-MNIST [3, 4, 7], Shapes [4, 5], and Textured MNIST [5]. In this work we consider several more complex datasets, including two relational version of Multi-MNIST (triplet, rgb), a variation on CIFAR10 that has RGB MNIST digits in the foreground, and high-resolution CLEVR images that contain many rendered geometric objects and require lighting and shadows to be modeled.\n\nIdeally we would be able to apply our approach to common segmentation datasets (eg.

In prior experiments we have explored several ablations and extensions of the current relational mechanism that approach these configurations. We were unable to obtain significantly better FID scores for any of these variations, and so we settled with the mechanisms proposed in [8] to model relations between objects. As our goal was to demonstrate the feasibility / benefits of incorporating such a mechanisms we did not consider it worth it to dedicate human evaluation to this.

Each of the object (foreground) generators draws an object in the scene at a random location (based on the mask, and RGB values), requiring location and size to be encoded in the latent representation z_i. This is important as it allows an inference model to extract this information correspondingly. \n\nWe would like to emphasize that the reported images in Figures 3 & 4 are representative of how the best performing models generate the scene. In other words, on all datasets we consistently find that the network generates the images as a composition of individual objects. Indeed on CLEVR we found cases in which a component generates more than one object, which is understood by the fact that the number of components is smaller than the number of objects in the scene (see also Figure 8 in Appendix A). We also find infrequent cases (primarily on CLEVR, although sometimes on CIFAR10) in which the background generator generates an additional object. This is understandable as there are no restrictions in our approach that prevent it from doing so. However, given that in almost all other cases the network generate images as compositions of objects and background it seems reasonable to conclude that these are due to optimization issues (as are common in GANs). After all, the compositional solution is clearly the superior choice, as is evident from our human evaluation compared to regular GAN.\n\n(4) We are unable to provide the experiment that you are proposing as unlike in [5] the MNIST digits considered in our approach do not appear at a fixed location.

Secondly, the fact that increasing the number of components to 4 or 5 reduces the accuracy with which the correct number of digits is generated only marginally (eg. Figure 6b) provides additional evidence that the relational mechanism has learned about the correct number of objects.\nFinally, the large difference in FID scores (Figure 9) in comparing k-GAN with and without a relational mechanism on rgb MM can only be explained by the relational mechanism correctly accounting for the different color of the digits.\n\n[1] Eslami, SM Ali, et al. \"Attend, infer, repeat: Fast scene understanding with generative models.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2016.\n[2] Greff, Klaus, et al. \"Neural expectation maximization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n[3] Greff, Klaus, et al. \"Tagger: Deep unsupervised perceptual grouping.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2016.\n[4] Lucic, Mario, et al. \"Are gans created equal? a large-scale study.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.10337 (2017).\n[5] Yang, Jianwei, et al. \"LR-GAN: Layered recursive generative adversarial networks for image generation.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2017.", "title": "Reply to Reviewer 2 [2 / 2] "}, "HyeRkQI26m": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkeddZo23m", "comment": "Thank you for your consideration and feedback.\n\nThe primary motivation of this work is to argue for object compositionality in deep generative models (and in particularly GANs), which originates from two key observations.

Second, in disentangling information content corresponding to different objects at a representational level they may be recovered a posteriori unlike in unstructured models.\n\nIn the following we will answer each of your comments.\n\n(1) Our conclusion regarding FID arises from the way the Inception network (that provides the embedding) was trained. In particular, by training on ImageNet for single-object classification it is unlikely that deep layers (eg. logits or final max-pool) provide high-level features that capture properties of multiple objects accurately. In particular, it suggests that FID is limited in accurately evaluating generated images containing multiple objects, even though it is accurate in evaluating generative models on ImageNet (or related single-object tasks like CIFAR10, etc.) as shown in [4]. Similarly, this does not preclude LR-GAN (or other compositional approaches) from using FID on ImageNet or CIFAR10.\n\nOn the contrary, we compute FID on multi-object images using an inception network that was pre-trained on single-object images (ImageNet). We are interested in verifying that the generated images are faithful with respect to the training distribution in terms of the number of objects, their identities, etc. To the best of our knowledge FID has not been used in this way previously. LR-GAN [5] evaluates the Inception score only on MNIST-ONE and not on MNIST-TWO, although they conclude that it is unsuitable even in the single object case (see Appendix 6.3). Based on our own observations in using FID on multi-object datasets (as summarised in Figure 9) we argue that FID is unable to judge generated images based on specific properties relating to multiple objects (eg. their total number, etc.). The large differences that are observed in evaluating the subjective quality (human eval - Figure 6a) for models with similar FID provide additional evidence that this is the case.\n\n(2) In this work we are interested generating scenes as compositions of objects, and in particular in verifying that this information can be disentangled at a representation level. This requires evaluation on datasets for which a clear notion of \u201cobject\u201d is available. Compared to prior work that has focused primarily on the representation learning part (eg.

[1]. Their approaches takes as input a pair of images (conditional generation) and corresponding segmentation masks that indicate which pixels of an input image belong to an object. Their framework then implements a means to compose the objects in the individual images to obtain a new image. On the other hand our generator only receives noise as input, and an important challenge is in learning how to disentangle information content belonging to different objects (identifying what objects are in the process), such that scenes may be generated in a compositional fashion. In that sense, our work and the work by Azadi et al. could be combined by using the Compositional GAN as a replacement for the \u201ccomposition\u201d operation in our approach, while ignoring the relational structure. One interesting observation is that the self-consistency loss from Azadi et al. could be used to learn a network that decomposes the composed image into images of individual objects, which is expected to benefit the discriminator (as per our discussion).

In particular, by factorizing complex relations into pairwise interactions, and weight sharing, this mechanism is compositional and invariant in the number of objects.

Unlike the counterpart which compose the images sequentially, the proposed method infer the relationships between multiple objects through a relational network before sending the hidden vectors to the generators. This way, the method can model the object-object interactions during the image generation. From the experimental results, the authors demonstrated that the proposed k-GAN can generate the images with comparable or slightly better FID compared with baseline GAN, and achieve plausible performance under the human study.\n\n[Strengthes]\n\n1. This paper proposed an interesting method for compositional image generation. Unlike the counterparts like LR-GAN, which generate foreground objects recurrently, this method proposed to derive the relationships between objects in parallel simultaneously. This kind of relational modeling has been seen in many other domains. It would be nice to see it can be applied to the compositional image generation domain.\n\n2. The authors tried multiple synthesized datasets, including multi-MNIST and its variants, CLEVR. From the visualization, it is found that the proposed k-GAN can learn to disentangle different objects and the objects from the background. This indicates that the proposed model indeed capture the hidden structure of the images through relational modeling. The human study on these generated images further indicate that the generated images based on k-GAN is better than those generated by baseline GAN.\n\n[Weaknesses]\n\n1. The main contribution of this paper fall to the proposed method for modeling the relational structure for multiple objects in the images. In the appendix, the authors presented the results for the ablated version which does not consider the relationships. As the authors pointed out, these results are a bit counterintuitive and concluded that FID is not a good metrics for evaluating compositional generation. However, as far as I know, the compositional generation can achieve much better Inception scores on CIFAR-10 in LR-GAN paper (Yang et al). Combining the results on MNIST in LR-GAN paper, I would suspect that the datasets used in this paper are fairly simple and all methods can achieve good results without much efforts. It would be good to show some results on more complicated datasets, such as face images with background, or cifar-10. Also, the authors did not present the qualitative results for independent version of k-GAN. Meanwhile, they missed an ablated human study when the relational modeling is muted. I would like to see how the generated images without modeling relationships look like to humans.\n\n2. Following the above comment, I think the datasets used in this paper is relatively simpler. In MM and CLEVR, the foreground objects are digits or simple cubes, spheres or cylinders. Also, the background is also simpler for these two datasets. Though CIFAR10+MM has a more complicated background, it is trivial for the model to distinguish the foregrounds from the backgrounds. Again, the authors should try more complicated datasets.\n\n3. Though the proposed method can model the relationship between objects simultaneously, I doubt its ability to  really being able to disentangle the foregrounds from the backgrounds. Since the background and foregrounds are both whole images, which are then combined with an alpha blending, the model cannot discover the conceptually different properties for foreground and background that foregrounds are usually small than background and scattered at various locations. Actually, this has been partially demonstrated by Figure 4. In the last row, we can find one sphere is in the background image. I tend to think the proposed model performs similar to Kwak & Zhang's paper without a strong proof for the authors that the relational modeling plays an important role in the model.\n\n4. It would be nice to perform more analysis on the trained k-GAN. Given the training set, like MM or CLEVR, I am wondering whether k-GAN can learn some reasonable relationship from the datasets. That is, whether it is smart enough to infer the right location for each objet by considering the others. This analysis can be performed, how much occlusions the generated images have compared with the real images. For example, on CLEVR, I noticed from the appendix that the generated CLEVR images base on k-GAN actually have some severe occlusions/overlaps.\n\n[Summary]\n\nIn this paper, the authors proposed an interesting method for image generation compositionally. Instead of modeling the generation process recurrently, the authors proposed to model the relationships simultaneously in the hidden vector space. This way, the model can generate multiple foreground objects and backgrounds more flexibly. However, as pointed above, the paper missed some experiment, ablation study and analysis to demonstrate the relational modeling in the image generation.
