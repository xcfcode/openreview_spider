Nevertheless, until now, infinite-width networks have been limited to at most two hidden layers. To address this shortcoming, we study the initialisation requirements of these networks and show that the main challenge for constructing them is defining the appropriate sampling distributions for the weights. Based on these observations, we propose a principled approach to weight initialisation that correctly accounts for the functional nature of the hidden layer activations and facilitates the construction of arbitrarily many infinite-width layers, thus enabling the construction of arbitrarily deep infinite-width networks. The main idea of our approach is to iteratively reparametrise the hidden-layer activations into appropriately defined reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and use the canonical way of constructing probability distributions over these spaces for specifying the required weight distributions in a principled way. Furthermore, we examine the practical implications of this construction for standard, finite-width networks. In particular, we derive a novel weight initialisation scheme for standard, finite-width networks that takes into account the structure of the data and information about the task at hand.

Using the representer theorem, a proper distribution for weights is constructed in H_{k_i} instead of being learned by \\phi_i, and then is formulated as a GP. \n\nCons:\n\nHowever, there are some key issues.\n1. The so-called \u201cinfinite width\u201d is just yielded by kernels in RKHS for weight initialization. For practical implementation, the authors use this scheme with random Fourier features to construct finite-width network.

Given that our proposed approach is agnostic to the choice of non-linearity, due to the iterative nature of the construction, the derived kernels will in general not be available in closed form and are thus not particularly suited for use within e.g. an SVM. However,  one can examine the structural properties of these kernels. We will clarify this point in the paper. \n\nUnlike Cho & Saul 2009 and Wilson et al 2016 who strive to derive kernels that mimic the computations in deep networks, this paper is motivated by the desire to improve our understanding of neural networks. In particular, we are motivated by the fact that single-layer infinite-width networks have played an important role in helping us acquire a better understanding of single-layer standard, finite-width networks. Until now the construction of infinite-width networks has been limited to at most two layers, while on the other hand we currently use deep finite-width networks. Our paper is an effort towards bridging this gap by enabling the construction of deep infinite-width networks that can then be used for analysing deep finite-width networks. This should help us gain a better understanding of deep, finite-width networks that have transformed the field dramatically over the last decade. Please also note that in this paper kernels are used as tools that enable us to more easily reason about the function spaces induced by the activations of an infinite-width network and are not the main focus of the paper. In particular, the main motivation of our paper is not the derivation of kernels that mimic computations in infinite-width neural networks, but the furthering our understanding of neural networks.\n\nConcerning the experimental results -- The main contribution of this paper is of theoretical nature (see Proposition 1 in our submission).

Thus, we purposefully did not use any advanced techniques, such as data augmentation, learning rate scheduling or architecture search, all of which are commonly used to improve state-of-the-art performance. \n\nIn particular, to appropriately validate our theory, we tested Win-Win against commonly used initialisation methods on three benchmarks datasets in classification and regression, thus showing that the performance of Win-Win initialisation is not tied to any particular dataset or task.

In particular, our method does not construct kernel mappings between layers and as such does not use these for weight initialisation. Furthermore, the distribution constructed over the RKHS H_{k_i} is not a result of the representer theorem as no objective is being minimised with respect to any training data. Specifically, this distribution is derived by studying the structure of the induced RKHS and is a known result from RKHS theory. Given the constructed weight distribution, this particular form of the weights arises due to the fact that the covariance function of the GP is a convolution of kernels. This can be easily verified by computing the covariance between the weights. Note that although the form of the weights does resemble the result from the representer theorem, it is not based on it, but follows from results on RKHS distributions as discussed above.\n\nBefore addressing the specific issues identified by the reviewer, we would first like to draw the attention of the reviewer to the main contribution of this paper (Proposition 1 in our submission), namely a method for constructing infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that allows us to go beyond just two layers of infinite width. As single-layer infinite-width networks have historically played an important role in helping us acquire a deeper understanding of standard, finite-width networks, being able to construct deep infinite-width networks should help us gain a better understanding of deep, finite-width networks.  \n\nAlthough the main contribution of this paper is of theoretical nature, we also discuss its immediate practical implications. In particular, we can transfer our findings from the infinite-width to the finite-width case. Specifically, we show how our proposed infinite-width construction approach gives rise to a novel weight initialisation scheme for finite-width networks that we term Win-Win. Furthermore, we conducted experiments with Win-Win on benchmark datasets across two different task domains, classification and regression, thus showcasing that our theoretical contribution has direct and practical relevance.\n\nWe now address the issues raised by the reviewer:\nThe infinite width of the layers is given by the fact that there are infinitely many weights connecting each pair of layers. In particular, the infinite width is not given by any kernel as we define our kernels at the level of individual layers that are of infinite width to begin with. Further, we would like to draw the attention of the reviewer to the fact that, after proposing a construction approach for infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers, we examine the implications of this construction for finite-width networks. In particular, the practical implications discussed are motivated by the idea of transferring the findings from infinite-width networks to their finite-width counterparts and thus hopefully enabling a better understanding of finite-width networks in general. Note that this is not done with the idea of practically implementing the proposed infinite-width construction approach.\nFurthermore, we note that we use Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the integrals derived in the infinite-width case. As we discuss in the paper, this can be viewed as a random features expansion of the kernels. Note, however, that in general this will not be a random Fourier features expansion because the underlying kernels are not guaranteed to be shift invariant.\n\nWith regard to the comment about ensuring that the \u201capproximated weights are still in the same space\u201d, we would like to point out that, in the finite-width case, this is automatically ensured as the weights are linear combinations of the activations. In particular, in the finite-width case, the required spaces are all subspaces of R^d , where d is the width of the respective layer. Thus, by examining the dimensionality of the weight vectors, it is straightforward to verify that the weights are indeed in the appropriate space. We understand this potential source of confusion and will provide further clarification in the paper.\n\n", "title": "Theoretical contribution validated by experimental results"}, "r1ezww6Up7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJlx_rSo3m", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their time and comments.\n\nIn the case of infinite-width networks, both the activations and weight \u201cvectors\u201d (connecting one layer with one neuron in the subsequent layer) are infinite-dimensional \u201cvectors\u201d, i.e. they are representable by functions. In order to be able to compute the inner product between activations and weights, these objects need to be in the same function space. If they are not in the same function space, then we cannot compute inner products between these quantities and therefore cannot define infinite-width networks correctly. If we assume that the activations are sufficiently well-behaved then the function space that they span will be a subset of, for example, L_{2}. In that case, we can characterise these functions in terms of their norms.  \n\nWith regard to the comment on the norm issue, in general we do not know how well-behaved activations are and are therefore not able to characterize the space of activations in terms of norms. Thus, in general, we have no way of quantifying the space of activations in terms of norms and cannot further address this issue apart from emphasizing that the activations and weights need to be in the same function space.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is theoretical, namely a method to construct infinite-width networks with arbitrarily many layers (Proposition 1 in our submission).

This summarises our main motivation for developing a construction approach for deep infinite-width networks. \n\nApart from purely theoretical merit, our theoretical contribution also has immediate practical implications. In particular, we can transfer some of our findings from the infinite-width case to finite-width networks. Specifically, we show how our proposed construction approach gives rise to a novel weight initialisation scheme for finite-width networks that we term Win-Win.\n\nDue to the theoretical nature and mathematical complexity involved, we agree that this paper is rather technical. We therefore tried to ease the reader into the challenges of defining deep infinite-width networks (see Section 3.1). We thank the reviewer for the comment about clarity and welcome any further comments on what we could add to the text to make this topic more approachable.\n\nAlthough the main contribution of this paper is theoretical in nature, we also discuss some practical implications of the developed theory.
