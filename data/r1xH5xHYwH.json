They also compare the representations learned from an unsupervised auto-encoder. They assess the different representations through cosine similarity within/between categories and through comparison with human judgments in an odd-one-out task. They find that (i) the auto-encoder representation does not capture the semantic information learned by the supervised representations and (ii) representations learned by the model depend on the label taxonomy,  how the targets are represented (1-hot vs. wordvec), and how the model is trained (e.g. fine-grained then coarse grained stages), (iiii) the different representations predict human judgements to differing degrees. the first finding is obvious and I'm not even sure why it needs to be stated -- of course semantics of images are not inherently encoded in the pixels of an image! The second point again, is not surprising . This paper starts to get at some interesting questions but does not follow through.  It is also quite confusing to read despite thee simple subject matter. This paper is also missing a related work section! There has been so much word on adding structure to the label space of image classifiers (e.g. models that learn image/text embedding space jointly, models that predict word vectors, graphical model approaches to building in semantic information, etc.) and none of this is discussed. There has also been work on comparing convnet representations to human percepts e.g. https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/Peterson_et_al-2018-Cognitive_Science.pdf)and none of this work is discussed! This work needs to be better situated within the context of previous work in this field. Please write a related work section.\n\nDetailed comments/questions:\n- It would be good to add a super-basic model to table 1 for comparison (i.e. first train of coarse level categories and then fine-tine on the more fine-grained taxonomy). \n- It would be good to compare the use of word vector representations at both the basic and superordinate levels; the 1-hot vs word vector targets and the basic vs superordinate taxonomy seem like orthogonal axess to explore and I'm not sure why the authors didn't test all combinations. \n- the authors found the imagenet categorical representations were most predictive of human judgements in the odd-one-out task. This seems highly unsurprising since (i) the humans saw images from the Imagenet dataset (not THINGS) and (ii) humans leverage semantic information when making similarity judgements. \n- What categories had the least inter-rater agreement.. was there any relationship between these categories and the similarity of representations learned by the convnet?\n- It seems the odd-one-out comparison always involves averaging image representations at the basic category level. In the case where the items come from three different superordinate classes it would bee interesting to see the results when averaging over superordinate classes as well.\n- In table 3, what does the FastText column just list \"true\"/\"false\" rather than accuracies? I would expect this column to show the accuracy when the FastText embeddings for the three words are used to compute similarity. I don't understand what the \"true\"/\"false\" is meant to indicate. Also it's not clear to be what the two rows in table three are meant to correspond to?\n- The authors claim \"Surprisingly, the kind of supervised input that proved most effective in matching human performance on the triplet odd-one-out task was training with superordinate labels\". This should be qualified to say that, when there are two or more superordinate classes represented in the triplet, the superordinate labels are highly effective when the three items come from three different superordinate classes. I'm also not clear why this would be surprising? Could the authors elaborate?\n- I'm surprised more space isn't given to discussing the wordvec representations since these should capture some of the semantic information that the 1-hot encodings might miss. In fact, the word vectors targets seem to perform as good as or close to the other representations on the odd-one-out\n\nIn short, I really like the overall idea of comparing convnet representations with human perceptions of images. However, this work barely scratches the surface of what could be done here and mostly reveals incredibly obvious results. There are so many interesting questions to ask regarding the relationship between how humans perceive similarity and what is encoded in a convnet representation. For example, it would have been very interesting to test the effects of asking the human rates to cue in on different aspects of the image. Focusing on semantic similarity, visual similarity, etc. would all likely give different ratings. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate (in light of rebuttal)\n\nI appreciate the authors lengthly and considered response. In particular, the updated related work and expansion of the empirical experiments. While I am more comfortable with this paper being accepted that previously (and have updated by score to \"weak accept\" to reflect this), I still think the paper has a lot of room for improvement. In particular, I suggest a more expansive analysis of human perceptions and a discussion f the implications of the findings.

However, the reviewers also pointed out that: 1) our paper could be improved by better situating our study in the context of existing research (R2, R5), and 2) evidence for the main claim was relatively weak and was not exhaustively explored (R1, R2, R5).

We also polished the formatting of figures and tables to increase their readability. We also added additional analyses in the supplementary material further supporting our main claims.

This seems highly unsurprising since (i) the humans saw images from the Imagenet dataset (not THINGS) and (ii) humans leverage semantic information when making similarity judgments.\u201d\n\nAnswer: We think this is an interesting finding because triplet prediction accuracy was highest when models used IMAGENET category representations and lowest when single exemplar representations were used, even if that exemplar image is the one that the participant actually saw during the experiment. This shows that when humans do visual similarity ratings, they not only evaluate visual inputs and use rich and abstract semantic information learned from viewing myriad exemplars.\n\n2) R2: \u201cIn table 3, what does the FastText column just list \"true\"/\"false\" rather than accuracies? I would expect this column to show the accuracy when the FastText embeddings for the three words are used to compute similarity. I don't understand what the \"true\"/\"false\" is meant to indicate. Also, it's not clear to be what the two rows in table three are meant to correspond to?\u201d \n\nAnswer: In the previous draft, we split the data by each condition first (\u2018NSUPER\u2019 column; by the number of superordinate labels that three items belong to) and then we split the data again by Fasttext prediction (\u2018FastText Correct\u2019 column, whether FastText embeddings correctly predict human judgement or not). The reason for this split was to compare the data that can be explained or cannot be explained by semantic information alone (FastText). However we understand this split is arbitrary and confusing, thus we decided to remove this split in the revised paper (Table 3).\n\n3) R2: \u201cthe authors claim \"Surprisingly, the kind of supervised input that proved most effective in matching human performance on the triplet odd-one-out task was training with superordinate labels\". This should be qualified to say that, when there are two or more superordinate classes represented in the triplet, the superordinate labels are highly effective when the three items come from three different superordinate classes. I'm also not clear why this would be surprising? Could the authors elaborate?\u201d\n\nAnswer: On triplet trials in which two of the images are from the same superordinate category and one is from a different category (the column labeled `2` in Table 3), people overwhelmingly (~90%)  chose the image from the different superordinate class as the odd-one-out. It is, of course, unsurprising that the models trained with superordinate labels perform so well on this task given that all the model needs to \u2018know\u2019 is which of the three is from a different class. What *is* surprising, we think, is that training with superordinate labels is so effective when the choice cannot be decided by appeal to the superordinate class (i.e., when all three images are from the same superordinate class (column `1`) or all three are from different superordinate classes (column `3`). For example, when items are from three different superordinate categories like \u2018orangutan\u2019, \u2018orange\u2019, \u2018minivan\u2019, one may need to use other information (either visual or more higher-level semantic information \u2018natural\u2019 vs \u2018man-made\u2019) to find the odd one. Interestingly, we can observe that our model trained with superordinate one-hot vector predicts human behavior better than other models even in these conditions. This is especially surprising, given that superordinate label one-hot vectors only give coarse-grained supervision (dim =10) compared to other basic label vectors (dim=30), combined vector (dim=40) or wordvectors (dim =300)\n\n4) R2: \u201cI'm surprised more space isn't given to discussing the wordvec representations since these should capture some of the semantic information that the 1-hot encodings might miss. In fact, the word vectors targets seem to perform as good as or close to the other representations on the odd-one-out\u201d\n\nAnswer: We agree with your observation and in fact we did expect that the models trained with distributed word vectors as targets would perform better than one-hot vector models for the reason the reviewer mentions. However, it turns out the performance of wordvec model was similar or lower than superordinate, which means, in turn, superordinate model was often as good or better as the model with word vectors. As described above, we think this is surprising, given that superordinate label one-hot vectors only give coarse-grained supervision (dim =10) compared to other basic label vectors (dim=30), combined vector (dim=40) or wordvectors (dim =300)\n", "title": "[Addressing Questions]"}, "BJxYabYiiS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HyefSpuJcS", "comment": "We thank R2 for pointing out the paper's weaknesses and providing interesting questions/suggestions that would be very helpful for exploring our idea.

Our study broadly benefits both computer vision and behavioral science (e.g., psychology, neuroscience) by suggesting that the semantic structure of labels and datasets should be carefully constructed if the goal is to build vision models that learn visual features representations having the potential for human-like generalization. For behavioral science, this research provides a useful computational framework for understanding the effect of training labels on the human learning of category relationships in the context of thousands of naturalistic images of objects. \n\n[Addressing the main claim]\nWe thank R5 for pointing out that the evidence supporting our main claim is relatively weak to strongly support our main claim that superordinate labels play a key role in shaping human-like visual representation.

Below are our comments answering R1\u2019s main concerns and explaining how we addressed them in the revised paper. \n\n[Addressing the main claim]\nAlthough R1 found the idea of studying the effect of linguistic labels on visual representation interesting, there was a concern that current analysis might have missed a meaningful structure that the model trained with no label (e.g.,Conv. Autoencoder) have. We agree that this is a possibility and that the results may vary depending on which metric and methods were used.\n\nTo address this issue, we visualized and analyzed the visual representations in multiple ways as possible. \n\n1) In addition to the cosine similarity matrix, we also added a T-SNE plot in the Supplementary 7.5, which was mistakenly missing from the previous paper. Both visualizations showed Conv. Autoencoder visual representations are poorly discriminable not only basic level categories but also superordinate level categories. \n2) We added in the supplementary 7.4 three more metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Davies-Bouldin Index) to analyze the discriminability of the visual representations for each category, in addition to the existing Between-to-within class variance metric. All metrics showed that Conv. Autoencoder has the poorest clustering quality. \n\nResults above together supported that the visual input alone is not sufficient to produce any clusterable structure, not to mention category representations. Of course, it\u2019s still possible that some aspects of the learned visual representations cannot be identified using our current visualization methods, but even if this were the case our main claim would still hold that:\n\n1) Guidance from superordinate labels was often as good or better as guidance from much finer-grained basic-level labels for shaping semantically structured visual representation.\n2) Human representations used in an odd-one-out task are highly modulated by semantic information, especially at the superordinate level\n\n[Addressing related work]\nAlthough R1 did not mention this as a major concern, we made major revisions (we hope for the better!) in describing how our work is situated in the context of existing research.
