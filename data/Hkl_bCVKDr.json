Input gradient regularization hasn't been able to achieve comparable robustness to  adversarial training. Built upon existing works, this paper derives two minimum perturbation bounds (L-bound and w-bound) to explain this, as well as other defenses such as Lipschitz regularization and defensive distillation. Taking a step further, this paper proposes to use the finite difference to estimate the input gradients, which not only gives a nice property for reduced modulus of continuity (eg. the w-bound), but also makes the regulation scalable to large networks and datasets. I quite like the theoretical connections derived in this paper. Empirical evidences support their claims, and demonstrate indeed comparable robustness of input gradient regularization to adversarial training.\n\nThe empirical results can be strengthened by including the normal input gradient regularization baseline (using double backpropagation), at least on cifar-10.

It's hard to fully explain finite differences in this venue, but they have been studied extensively. In particular, finite differences work well for a range of values: to large and they lose accuracy, too small, and they are vulnerable to rounding errors.  In this case, the performance of the model for h < 1e-3 may simply be due to rounding errors. Rounding errors are a well-studied phenomenon:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error\n\nKeep in mind that symbolic differentiation (i.e. backpropagation) is one technique for estimating derivatives, and finite differences is anther.  Both of these are being combined with stochastic gradient descent training. For smooth models, the estimated derivatives should be robust to the method used.  The fact that the results of training deep models are so sensitive to the method of approximation used is itself motivation for our study of regularization/modulus of continuity.   ", "title": "finite differences are well-studied"}, "BygMedNoor": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rygwuNfjjB", "comment": "We can elaborate more on the link between finite differences and the modulus of continuity when the model is twice differentiable. In that case, the modulus of continuity is proportional to the maximum curvature. For illustration, in 1D $\\omega(\\epsilon) = \\sup_{x,v\\leq\\epsilon} f(x+v) - f(x) - v f\u2019(x)$. Use Taylor\u2019s theorem to expand $f(x+v) = f(x) + v f\u2019(x) + v^2 f{\u2019}{'}(\\xi)$ for some $x\\leq\\xi\\leq x+v$, which gives\n $$\\omega(\\epsilon) =  \\epsilon^2 \\sup_{\\xi} f{\u2019}{'}(\\xi)$$\nIn other words, the modulus of continuity is $\\epsilon^2$ times the maximum curvature. In n-dimensions this can be generalized, so that the modulus of continuity is proportional to the maximum Hessian norm (induced by the particular norm used to measure adversarial robustness), or colloquially the maximum curvature.\n\nNow turning to our finite difference regularization term. Again from Taylor\u2019s theorem the finite difference is exactly\n$$\\frac{ f(x+v) \u2013 f(x)}{h} = \\langle \\nabla f(x), v \\rangle + h \\langle v, \\nabla^2 f(\\xi) v \\rangle $$\nfor some $\\xi$ along the line $(x, x+v)$.\nBy squaring this quantity, we control both the gradient and the Hessian in the direction of $v$. When $v=\\frac{\\nabla f(x)}{||\\nabla f(x)||}$, as in our method, we are controlling the gradient norm squared, as well as the curvature (Hessian) in the direction of the gradient.\n\nWe could formalize this argument in an appendix section if so desired.\n\nNote that this squared finite difference term does not control the maximum curvature everywhere (the modulus of continuity), but it does provide some control on the curvature locally. We remark that it is not possible for regularization to control the worst-case curvature everywhere across all inputs, however it does a good job locally and empirically. Just as gradient regularization provides some control of the worst-case gradient (the Lipschitz constant -- see eg Hein  & Andriushchenko, NIPS 2017 or Weng et al, ICLR 2018), our method provides some control over the worst-case curvature (the modulus of continuity).\n\nA brief remark on finite difference error and autograd error. In the limit as $h$ goes to zero, finite differences do not in general recover the autograd estimate of the gradient. This is because models are not differentiable. For example take $f(x) = |x| = \\max\\{x,0\\} +\\max\\{-x,0\\}$. At $x=0$ forward finite differences give $f\u2019(0)=1$, whereas autograd yields $f\u2019(0)=0$. We believe this hints at the reason for the counter-intuitive results for small $h$. However the fact that autograd and finite differences do not agree in the limit as $h \\rightarrow 0$ is a difficult and involved topic best addressed by others (see for example Bolte and Pauwels 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10300 )\n\nIn summary, our paper contributes the following: (1) robustness bounds that are tighter than previous Lipschitz-based bounds, using the modulus of continuity; and (2) a fast & scaleable implementation of gradient regularization that empirically reduces the modulus of continuity in addition to the gradient, leading to adversarially models comparable to adversarial training. We show that gradient regularization is a valid method for promoting adversarial robustness. Prior to our work it was not clear if gradient regularization could compete with adversarial training. Overall we argue that these contributions alone are very valuable insights to the community.\n\n[2019-11-14 edited for TeX errors]", "title": "More theory and a summary"}, "r1enJeGiir": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJecA7_sKr", "comment": "As requested, we have updated the paper with a study on the affect of $h$ on the performance.", "title": "Study on the effect of h"}, "SJe1wkMoor": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "S1xBfNe5oB", "comment": "Thanks for the timely reply. Regarding your remarks:\n\n1) We provide two bounds which say that robust models must necessarily have small gradients and small moduli of continuity.  The (w)-bound says that if both the gradients of the loss are small and the modulus of continuity is small (and the model has small loss), the network will be adversarially robust up to perturbations of a certain size. The (L)-bound says if the Lipschitz constant of the loss is small, the network is robust up to perturbations of a certain size. These bounds are valid in any norm.\n\nIn practice we use these bounds in Tables 2 & 3 for the L-infinity and L2 norms. Each table has a column with the predicted number of perturbed images at a particular threshold (using the theoretical bounds), as well as the usual columns showing empirically how many images were perturbed. We can see that the theoretical bounds do a good job of capturing the robustness of the model, without having to actually attack the model.\n\nAs for novelty. These bounds are tighter and more accurate than existing ones in the literature. To our knowledge, all bounds to date have used the model outputs, whereas ours uses the loss of the model.  Moreover, the literature has focused on the Lipschitz constant of the model for deriving bounds. We have introduced the importance of the modulus of continuity in adversarial robustness bounds.  The modulus of continuity provides bounds that are locally more accurate than Lipschitz-type bounds. This is because they use two local pieces of information, the loss value and the gradient, whereas Lipschitz-type bounds use only one local piece of information.\n\nThe proposed method, gradient regularization with finite differences, is directly motivated by (w)-bound: the method ensures that both gradients are small and the modulus of continuity is small. See for example Table 3 where we empirically demonstrate that gradient regularization with finite differences ensures small gradients and moduli of continuity.\n\nThe only approximations we have made are (i) when we estimate the modulus of continuity and the Lipschitz constant for estimating the bounds, using techniques from Extreme Value Theory (as in Weng et al, ICLR 2018); and (ii) finite differences. The former does not play a role in the proposed training method; the approximation is only used after-the-fact on trained models. Finite differences are important for controlling the modulus of continuity: compare gradient regularization via autograd versus with finite differences. Furthermore, finite differences are vastly faster than double backpropagation.\n\n2) There are two measures here: efficiency, and robustness. Let\u2019s compare: (a) AT, Madry-style; (b) AT, \u201cFor Free\u201d; and (c)  our proposed method. If the end user only cares about robustness, then the ranking is: (1) Madry-style AT,  (2) our method, (3) AT \u201cFor Free\u201d. However note that our method performs nearly as well as Madry-style AT: refer to Figure 1, where we show that the robustness curves of our method are comparable to Madry-style AT. If instead the end user cares about training time, the ranking is (1) AT \u201cFor Free\u201d; (2) our method; (3) Madry-style AT.\n\nOur proposed method achieves nearly state-of-the-art at fractions of the training time in L-infinity. In L2 the proposed method surpasses adversarial training.\n\nWe have updated the tables to compare against double backpropagation, the method used in \u201cImproving Adversarial Robustness ... by Regularizing their Gradients\u201d  (Ros & Doshi-Velez, AAAI 2018). As can be seen in Table 2, our method outperforms double backpropagation.\nMoreover, Ros & Doshi-Velez only studied robustness in L2, only compared against one-step PGD attacks, and only compared against one-step adversarial training. Thus in our opinion it wasn\u2019t clear from that work whether gradient regularization could compete with adversarial training. We believe our work answers this question.\n\n3) It\u2019s commonly accepted that statistics can be estimated from a sample of the dataset. We randomly chose 1000 of the 10000 validation images, which should be enough statistically.\n\nMany other adversarial robustness papers have done this. To name a few: \u201cDecision-Based Adversarial Attacks: Reliable Attacks Against Black-Box Machine Learning Models\u201d (Brendel et al, ICLR 2018); \u201cCertified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing\u201d (Cohen et al, ICML 2019); \u201cEvaluating the robustness of neural networks: An extreme value theory approach\u201d (Weng et al, ICLR 2018); and \u201cDifferentiable abstract interpretation for provably robust neural networks\u201d (Mirman et al, ICML 2018).", "title": "Clarification"}, "ryg_844Pjr": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Skl8D_5VoH", "comment": "Hi, thank you for the incisive observation. Indeed Section 2 discusses why it is necessary to control the modulus of continuity; not until Section 3.1 do we discuss the finite difference implementation of the gradient penalty term.\n\nWe (briefly) addressed why the finite difference implementation controls the modulus of continuity, in the paragraph following Proposition 3.2. Admittedly we could expand on this paragraph a bit more in the text if so desired, please let us know.\n\nIn detail, one way to see why finite differences control the modulus of continuity as follows. From the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have that for a piecewise differentiable function $f(x)$ (such as the loss of a model with ReLU activations) the finite difference is\n$$\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^1 f'(x+th) dt$$\nIn other words, the finite difference is the average of the derivative along the line $[x, x+h]$. The modulus of continuity is the maximum amount of change in the derivative. If the modulus of continuity is large, then so too must the average; and vice versa. Thus if we control the average (via finite differences), we also control the maximum change in the derivative (ie, the modulus of continuity).\n\n[edit] We'd also like to remark that empirically, the finite difference implementation of the gradient penalty term does an excellent job of controlling the modulus of continuity: see Table 3, where we report the modulus of continuity $\\omega(0.5)$ and $\\omega(1)$.

We\u2019ll address each criticism directly.\n\n1) Our main contribution is not gradient regularization and its finite difference implementation, taken separately these are both well-established techniques. Our main contribution is the theoretical justification for gradient regularization, and empirical results showing that gradient regularization is indeed effective for adversarial training. Prior to our work there has been much debate as to whether gradient regularization could be effective for robustness; some had suggested gradient regularization results in gradient obfuscation. We show this is not so when finite differences are used. Moreover finite differences yield significant speed-ups in training time.\n\nOur results show gradient regularization yields comparable adversarial robustness to adversarial training, at a fraction at the training time. That is, their respective robustness results are on the same order. Focusing on one number (L-inf results at \\eps=8/255) without considering context is a poor characterization of our work.\n\nWe are not claiming gradient regularization is a replacement for adversarial training, or that it is better. However we do show empirically that it can achieve quite good results. Given that our implementation is scaleable, practitioners may want to use gradient regularization when training time is a limiting  factor. This is an important point.\n\n2) There are many works showing that L-infinity adversarial training provides robustness in L2, and vice versa (see eg Madry et al\u2019s oft-cited work). We chose to compare against L-infinity trained models, because there is a common set of agreed upon hyper-parameters used in the literature for L-infinity training. Other L2 robustness papers have compared against L-infinity trained models. For example Qian and Wegman (2019,  https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxGSsR9FQ) compare against L-infinity adversarially trained models, even though their results (which at the time were state-of-the-art) are for robustness in L2.\n\nFollowing your comments and that of Reviewer 3, we have now included comparisons with \u2018double backprop\u2019 gradient regularization, updated in Tables 2 and 3 of the revised manuscript.\n\n3) This is exactly the point we are trying to make: (w)-bound must be small, however controlling the estimate of the gradient (with double backprop) does not suffice to control the modulus of continuity. In contrast, the modulus of continuity is controlled via finite differences. See Table 3, which lists modulus of continuity estimates, and is now updated to compare finite differences  against double backpropagation. As you can see in the updated Tables 1 & 2, double backpropagation yields worse adversarial robustness than with finite differences, and is much slower.\n\nIn other words, the error of the finite difference approximation is quite important for controlling the modulus of continuity. It is important not to make h small.\n\nAs an aside, since these models are not even differentiable, in the limit as h goes to zero, finite differences do not provide the same gradient estimate as backpropagation.  For illustration, take f(x) = max(x,0) + min(x,0). Finite differences yield f\u2019(0)=1, whereas backpropagation yields f\u2019(0) = 2. Finite differences are analytically correct, but backpropagation is not.\n", "title": "Reply to reviewer 2"}, "B1xrk4KNoS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Bker_uuRYS", "comment": "Thanks for your review, we appreciate you taking the time to review our paper. We will address your criticisms in order.\n\nThe work is a theory paper deriving robustness bounds which justify gradient regularization as a method for training adversarially robust models. It is not \u2018just\u2019 an empirical work; the empirical results we present in the last two pages backup our theoretical results. We are not claiming that gradient regularization is superior to adversarial  training. However our empirical results show that gradient regularization can achieve comparable robustness to adversarial training, at a fraction of the training time of \u2018traditional\u2019 adversarial training (in the style of say Madry et al).\n\nWe don\u2019t see the connection to logit squeezing. We are unaware of a reason why small logits should imply loss gradients are small, or vice versa.\n\nOur implementation of gradient regularization with finite differences indeed has some similarities to logit pairing. Logit pairing was proposed with a heuristic justification and lacked theoretical robustness guarantees. Our method is backed theoretically via robustness bounds. Our method could be seen as complimentary to logit pairing, in that for a special choice of the pairing function (difference of the training loss, which is not discussed in the original logit pairing paper), the implementations of logit pairing and finite difference gradient regularization coincide. Our work could  then be interpreted as providing some theoretical justification for logit pairing, in certain scernarios.\n\nAs requested, we have amended our submission to include a comparison with \u2018For Free\u2019 adversarial training (Shafahi et al 2019), using the same hyperparameters as in that work. Please see the revised Table 1. Currently we have updated CIFAR-10; ImageNet-1k results will take awhile, and could be included later. We found that `For Free\u2019 adversarial training was not able to outperform traditional adversarial training, nor did it outperform gradient regularization. It is very fast though!\n\nWe did not compare against regularizer-based robust models because they are not the current state-of-the-art. Do you have a particular citation against which we should compare?\n\nPlease take a look at the empirical results as a whole: our aim was not to outperform adversarial training in all circumstances. Instead we have proposed a method that is considerably faster, and which provides good robustness that is on the same order as the robustness of adversarial training. In many circumstances we would argue our approach is very desirable, for example when training is limited by time constraints.\n\nRegarding Table 2. Is it that you would prefer results reported at certain distances in L2? We chose instead to report the median distance, because (unlike in L-infinity) there is no commonly accepted distances to report robustness results at. Until the community agrees on a standard L2 distance for reporting, we think reporting the median distance is a fair metric. We did not want to be accused of cherry-picking our L2 results by selecting arbitrary L2 thresholds.\n\nThere are many adversarial robustness papers which report results on only a subset of test images. It is very computationally demanding to obtain results on all test images.\n\nIn our experience we have found ResNeXt outperforms ResNet and Wide-ResNets in terms of both robustness and test accuracy, and is faster to train. It is entirely fair to use newer & better architectures as they are developed. We don\u2019t believe researchers should be constrained to use a particular architecture for reporting results.\n\nWe don\u2019t claim that max_v l( x+v) - c(v) is the squared dual norm of \\grad l. However it is approximately equivalent (up to second order) when c(v) is the squared norm and l is differentiable. To see this, Taylor expand l(x+v); and discard second order terms. Then use Legendre duality to solve the (approximate) maximization problem directly.

The standard gradient regularization is implemented with \"double backpropagation\", which could be time consuming for large networks. This paper proposes to replace the exact gradient by its discretization via finite difference, which is computationally more efficient comparing to \"double backpropagation\".  Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the method in reducing training time. \n\nOverall, the paper is well written but the contribution is very limited and I find some of the experimental comparisons unfair.  Thus I do not support publication of the paper. Here are my detailed arguments.\n\n1) The gradient regularization is not novel\nThe main contribution of the paper is to use the finite difference in the gradient regularization in order to improve the training time.  The method of gradient regularization is not new, hence the contribution is only the computational effectiveness. This would be fine if one could improve the state-of-the-art method's training time by a lot, but according to the experiments, the performance of adversarial robustness is far from the adversarial training, for example in CIFAR10 epsilon=8/255, there is a 12% drop, which is a huge gap. \n\n2) Unfair comparison in the experiments\nIn table 2, the performance of robustness with respect to the l2 norm is presented. However, in the baseline method of adversarial training, the used attack is in l_{infty} norm. This is unfair since l2 norm and l_{infty} norm has very different characteristics. Moreover, the gradient regularization uses l2 norm instead of l_{1} as in table 1, which makes the comparison unfair. \n\nFurthermore, the finite difference improves the training time versus the standard gradient regularization, but it does not imply that the performance will be the same. In particular, it would be better to include the performance of standard gradient regularization in table 1 and 2 as well. \n\n3) Comment on the motivation/theory\nThe theory part is fairly straightforward and it clearly shows that the norm of gradient (w.r.t input) itself is not sufficient to guarantee robustness. As a evidence, even under standard training (for example on MNIST), the gradient norm could be very small, in order of 10^{-4} but still have adversarial example with very small perturbation.  Thus, what we also need is to control how fast this gradient changes (Lipschitz constant or w-bound). However, the gradient norm regularization does not take into account how gradient changes. It is claimed that the finite discretization implicitly reduces how the gradient changes, however, I am not convinced by the argument since as long as we take h to be small, it is still a very local measure. An interesting question would be how h affect the performance and it is not discussed in the paper.  ", "title": "Official Blind Review #2", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 2}}}
