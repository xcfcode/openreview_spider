Our paper builds on a large literature of retrieval based translation, so we also call our approach machine translation. For example, prior work uses retrieval for translation in the context of example-based machine translation, analogy-based translation, or translation memories, among others. Please see the last paragraph in the related work section of the updated paper and the number of references therein. \n\nIn order to make this clear and up front in the paper,  we revised both the abstract and introduction to highlight that our translation is by retrieval (see last line of the abstract and last line of the third paragraph in the introduction). Following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we also clarify in the last paragraph of the related work that we use translation-by-retrieval, and how that allows us to rigorously validate the cross-lingual alignment of the representations.\n\n**(2) there are issues with the evaluation of the models, i.e. machine-translated data is used not just at training time but also as validation/test data.**\n\nThank you for raising this important point. We agree this could be a potential issue. Therefore in order to show that our method generalizes to human-translated test data, we collected a new human-translated dataset and evaluated our models on it. In short, these new results show our conclusions are still valid.\n\nWe built our new test set by starting with 200 English sentences, then recruiting bilingual speakers to translate them into a target language. We translate each sentence into 11 languages: Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Polish, Hebrew, Korean, Spanish, Dutch, Hindi, French and Turkish. All of the translators are fluent in both English and the target language.\n\nWe then evaluate our model and the baselines on these translations, as well as on the machine-translated translations for the exact same sentences. We report the results of our experiment on Table 4 of the updated paper, using the same metric as in Table 3, but now for $M=11$ languages. We also included an explanation of the experiment at the end of Section 5.2.\n\nOur findings still hold on this new dataset. The relative ranking between methods is maintained. (both our method and the baselines) see similar (and small) decreases in performance. Overall the results show that the human evaluation does not influence the advantage of our method with respect to the baselines, and that the evaluation gives a very good indication of how the model performs on human natural language.\n\nIn the process of gathering our human-translated parallel corpus, translators remarked that the machine translations were of high quality, given the complexity of the text in the dataset. To quantify this, we computed the edit distance between the machine translation and the human translation, and the median across all languages was only 1.385 different words per sentence.\n\nThe human translations will be released along with the rest of the dataset.\n\n**(3) a more thorough comparison to crosslingual retrieval models in the recent literature.**\n\nWe have included a more thorough discussion on both cross-lingual retrieval methods and machine translation methods in the revised paper. However, most of these approaches learn with only one modality -- text.\n\nInstead, our paper investigates a relatively underexplored direction by leveraging images to create a transitive closure for unsupervised learning. Although there is still a gap between unsupervised and supervised methods (Figure 3), we believe our findings are scientifically important to publish. Compared to multiple established unsupervised baselines in word-level and sentence-level translations, our paper demonstrates that vision helps machine translation, substantially narrowing the performance gap. Since translation is a classical problem in natural language processing and we propose an unconventional approach, we believe this paper will receive wide interest at the conference. \n\nWe already compare with XLM. Note that x-STILT, the baseline suggested by the reviewer, is equivalent to  XLM with some extra finetuning steps that depend on the downstream task. There is no specific retrieval associated with its pretraining. \n\nFinally, please note that all the \u201cbells and whistles\u201d of industrial machine translation systems can also be applied to our method to further refine its accuracy.", "title": "Thank you for the valuable comments; addressing the raised concerns below."}, "mSdvNCqVRRX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rpr2sc0oEZm", "comment": "We would like to thank Reviewer 4 for their positive review and constructive comments, and for describing our work as \u201cwell written and easy to follow\u201d, and our experiments to be \u201cconvincing with interesting case studies\u201d.\n\n**Low-resource languages**  \n\nThank you for raising this point. There was a typo in the paper, and we apologize for the confusion. We meant to write that our approach tackles \u201clow resource language pairs\u201d. We corrected the paper and modified the expression to \u201crare language pairs\u201d to avoid confusion. In our method, individual languages still require enough sentences to be able to perform the translation properly. Note however that individual languages do not require any alignment with any other language, hence the use of \u201crare language pairs\u201d. \n\nWe believe that our data gathering method is a more scalable process, even for low-resource languages, than the traditional NLP pipeline for annotating translations. We are training on *noisy* sentences that are descriptions of images on the Internet. Many languages are low resource in NLP but have an active Internet presence allowing for gathering of this kind of data.\n\n**Minor concerns:**  \n\n**Evaluation may be somehow unfair**  \nThe experiments are fair because they are all trained and evaluated on the same dataset and all of them use the same tokenization.

We address the raised concerns in the next paragraphs.\n\n**Main contribution**\n\nWe believe there may have been a misunderstanding surrounding the paper\u2019s main contribution. While our framework uses contrastive learning for estimating similarities, this misses the bigger picture. \n\nOur main contribution is a framework that leverages a transitive closure through vision in order to learn to do translation (see Figure 2). This transitive closure requires computing both inter- and intra-modality similarities. There are many different ways to compute the required similarity. We use contrastive loss because it has obtained very good results in the recent literature. Our framework will support any form of contrastive learning, such as the triplet loss or the ones mentioned in the review. Our contribution is broader than a new type of contrastive loss. \n\n**Ablation studies**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have added ablation studies to the paper as well as additional discussion in the paper\u2019s text. We briefly review these changes here.\n\nThe results of the ablations are the following (also shown in Figure 3). The values represent the percentage of retrieved positives in the the sentence translation task:  \nFull model: 72.3 %  \nWithout Lc: 68.4 %  \nWithout Lt: 63.3 %  \nWithout Lv: 9.5 %  \nWithout Lx: 9.0 %  \nWithout Lx and Lv (text-only baseline): 8.9 %  \n\nNot training with Lx or Lv implies breaking the transitive closure represented in Fig. 2, which results in a drastic decrease in performance. This transitive closure is the basis of our approach.\n\nLt is the loss that makes the cross-lingual alignment explicit, but importantly it is not required to close the transitive relation through the visual modality. Training without it represents a considerable drop in accuracy, but the results are still better than baselines.  \n\nFinally, Lc also contributes to the final performance, consistently with prior work (Lample & Conneau, 2019; Liu et al., 2020)\n\n**Translation by retrieval**\n\nThank you for raising this point. Our paper builds on a large literature of retrieval based translation, so we also call our approach machine translation. For example, prior work uses retrieval for translation in the context of example-based machine translation, analogy-based translation, or translation memories, among others. See the last paragraph in the related work section of the updated paper and the number of references therein. \n\nHowever, we agree the nomenclature is confusing! Therefore, we updated the paper to make  it clear both in the abstract and introduction that the translation we use is by retrieval. Please see the last line of the abstract and the third paragraph in the introduction. We also clarify in the last paragraph of the related work that we use translation-by-retrieval, and how that allows us to rigorously validate the cross-lingual alignment of the representations.\n\n**Evaluation of the retrieval task on the generative baselines**\n\nAll the baselines, including the generative ones, encode the input sentences into a representation that lies in the cross-lingual shared representation space. We evaluate the sentence translation experiments on this representation. This representation can be fed to a decoder that generates the caption, as we do in Appendix A.5.\n\n**Missing references**\n\nThank you for pointing this out.

The data used in the model are image-caption pairs in each language, and never parallel sentences in two or more languages. Authors use existing English-language image captioning datasets (Flickr30k, MSCOCO, Google Conceptual Captions) and translate the English captions into 51 other languages using a machine translation system, therefore bootstrapping image-caption pairs in 52 languages including English. The paper is very well written and easy to read.\n\nSome positive points: (1) the method is simple and elegant, and seems to produce strong results compared to a few other baselines; (2) the collected dataset will be released with the research community; (3) parts of the experimental setup were thoughtfully done, e.g. how to create the data splits across languages/images.\n\nSome negative points: (1) the framing of the paper is not adequate, i.e. authors propose a model for \"unsupervised multilingual translation\" but they propose a model for crosslingual retrieval; (2) there are issues with the evaluation of the models, i.e. machine-translated data is used not just at training time but also as validation/test data; (3) parts of the experimental setup could be improved, i.e. a more thorough comparison to crosslingual retrieval models in the recent literature.\n\nI recommend that the paper do not be accepted for publication in its current form for all the reasons mentioned above. I will provide detailed comments on these points below.\n\nMy first comment has to do with the framing of the paper. I am not sure I would call the proposed method one for \"machine translation\". This is not a generative translation model, but rather a retrieval model that retrieves similar sentences in a foreign language. I would certainly add a very big disclaimer in the introduction, if not in the title of the paper, clearly stating this. Machine translation's main issues are due to the fact a model needs to generate text in natural language, which is (1) hard to evaluate due to the difficulty in defining what consists a good translation, (2) the lack/difficulty in having adequate automatic metrics to evaluate MT, (3) the need for reference translations to which to compare hypotheses generated by the model, etc. This paper does not address any of these problems. It is true that the authors show a few examples at the end of Appendix A where they generate translations with GPT-2, but these are utterly secondary experiments, there is no evaluation conducted on the generated translations, etc.\n\nAnother central issue in the paper: Models are trained on datasets where the non-English language sides of the data were all machine-translated from English. Validation and test sets do not seem to be human translated either. To summarize: authors train and evaluate their models on data which is machine translated to begin with. Training on MT'ed data is not an issue necessarily and can often be helpful, i.e., back-translation is an example where training on additional MT'ed source sentences paired with gold-standard target sentences can help. However, you need to control for the quality of your validation and test sets. If they are also machine translated, you are probably introducing a lot of unintended biases (see [1] for a discussion). Note that in addition to evaluating in \"translationese\", these MT'ed data were not even validated by a human, meaning we do not even know if translations used as references in the validation/test sets are correct. This makes the whole evaluation questionable.\n\nAll issues considered, since the method is a crosslingual retrieval model that uses images, the authors should compare to other baselines proposed specifically for crosslingual sentence retrieval. One such model is X-STILTs [2], which performs well on Tatoeba and BUCC, two datasets proposed specifically for crosslingual sentence retrieval. Since these datasets have no associated images, it is not straightforward to evaluate on them with the proposed model. However, authors could retrieve images for sentences in Tatoeba/BUCC using a crossmodal retrieval model, and train their proposed model on the retrieved image-sentence pairs. Since the proposed model is already robust to noisy image-sentence alignments (Section 3.2, last paragraph), perhaps authors could show how it performs compared to strong crosslingual retrieval baselines. I mentioned [2] but there are many more, check the Google XTREME Benchmark for more examples [6].\n\nA few other comments:\n\n\"Machine translation aims to learn a mapping between sentences of different languages while also maintaining the underlying intent.\" -> This is an odd way to define/introduce machine translation (MT). I'd say \"underlying semantics\", not intent.\n\n\"Experiments and visualizations show that the transitive relations through vision provide excellent self-supervision for learning neural machine translation\" -> \"In our experiments and visualizations we show (...)\"\n\nCorrect citation for \"Image pivoting for learning multilingual multimodal representations\" is the peer-reviewed paper \"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1303/\". You are also missing the paper \"Sentence-Level Multilingual Multi-modal Embedding for Natural Language Processing\", \"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R17-1020/\", which additionally uses learned representations for neural machine translation. Please double-check all your citations that reference pre-prints to make sure there is no peer-reviewed version of a cited pre-print available.\n\nIn your related work, perhaps you could at least mention (the massive amount of) previous work on sentence-image ranking/retrieval, even if these works are not multilingual [3,4,5]?\n\nSection 3.2 \"However, these constraints provide a sparse gradient for learning, which makes large-scale optimization difficult.\" What do you mean by sparse gradients?\n\n\"cross-modal similarity as well as a cross-image similarity\" -> \"sentence-image similarity as well as a image-image similarity\"\n\nYou could improve the mathematical notation greatly. I would mention, for example, the different variables represented by alpha. The variable \\alpha_{ii} is especially badly named, please use more discriminative/clearer variable names. Different indices (i, j, etc.) should index different things.\n\nIf Eq.5 is being maximised, you should not call the quantity being maximised a loss. A loss is always minimised by definition, e.g. negative log-likelihood loss.\n\n[1] M. Zhang and A. Toral (2019). The Effect of Translationese in Machine Translation Test Sets. In: WMT 2019.

The cross-modal alignment between language and images is used to estimate and guide the learning of cross-lingual representations. \n\nThe main contribution is to apply the contrastive loss on the cross-modality pre-training. A connection or analysis to InfoNCE should be addressed. The $L_v$ is to distinguish the image and its distortion with other images. The $L_x$ is to distinguish the image and its caption with other pairs. The $L_t$ seems to be a weighted caption level InfoNCE, where weights are calculated from the visual similarity and caption similarity. The $L_c$ is actually the same as masking token loss in BERT, which can also be formulated as mutual information maximization (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08350.pdf). \n\nSince the overall loss function is a linear combination of 4 different losses, I think at least an ablation study is needed to address the importance of each loss function. Especially, I would like to see if $L_v$ or $L_x$ are removed, whether the model performance will drop significantly. \n\nAnother thing I may misunderstand is that the experiments in this paper are claimed as translation, but I think it (sentence level) is more like retrieval.
