We study the instance classification solution, which regards each instance as a category, and improve the optimization and feature quality. The proposed consistent instance classification (ConIC) approach simultaneously optimizes the classification loss and an additional consistency loss explicitly penalizing the feature dissimilarity between the augmented views from the same instance. The benefit of optimizing the consistency loss is that the learned features for augmented views from the same instance are more compact and accordingly the classification loss optimization becomes easier, thus boosting the quality of the learned representations. This differs from InstDisc and MoCo that use an estimated prototype as the classifier weight to ease the optimization. Different from SimCLR that directly compares different instances, our approach does not require large batch size. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance for linear evaluation and better performance than InstDisc, MoCo and SimCLR at downstream tasks, such as detection and segmentation, as well as competitive or superior performance compared to other methods with stronger training setting.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper introduces a consistency loss for instance discrimination by adding a term to maximize the squared dot product between two views of the same image. The impact of the proposed approach is evaluated on a variety of settings with mixed improvements. While reviewers generally found the proposed method to be interesting, there were concerns regarding the novelty of the approach, the size of the performance improvement, and the choice to focus on instance discrimination vs. more recent approaches based on contrastive instance discrimination. \n\nWhile I do not share the reviewer concerns regarding novelty, I am sympathetic to the concerns regarding the size of the improvement and the focus on instance discrimination. As such, I recommend that the paper be rejected in its current form. I would encourage the authors to apply their analysis and method to more recent contrastive instance discrimination approaches such as SimCLR and SWaV as well as non-explicitly contrastive, but high performing methods like BYOL. I would also encourage the authors to provide quantitative empirical analyses demonstrating the impact of the consistency term on large models rather than just toy models to demonstrate the impact of the consistency term in representational space.

In fact, we DO NOT aim to have a better balance, and instead, we still want to optimize the classification loss better and we pick the model parameters with smaller classification loss.

We discussed this in Section 3.1 and the third paragraph in Section 1. MoCo uses the moving average scheme to compute the classifier weight estimate, easing the optimization.  And SimCLR, whose objective function might be better than instance classification, however, needs large batch size, which is discussed in the last part about \u201cBatch size\u201d in Section 3.
