Recent progress in few-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized model for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing different classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and its corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot classification paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also available within each episode. We consider two situations: one where all unlabeled examples are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the labeled examples of the episode, as well as the more challenging situation where examples from other distractor classes are also provided. To address this paradigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when producing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end way on episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully. We evaluate these methods on versions of the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted to this new framework augmented with unlabeled examples. We also propose a new split of ImageNet, consisting of a large set of classes, with a hierarchical structure. Our experiments confirm that our Prototypical Networks can learn to improve their predictions due to unlabeled examples, much like a semi-supervised algorithm would.", "keywords": ["Few-shot learning", "semi-supervised learning", "meta-learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper extends the earlier work on Prototypical networks to semi-supervised setting.

Based on our preliminary reading, [1] is a journal version that builds on top of [2], with both papers presenting very similar approaches for the application of event recognition in videos. Transductive Multi-View Zero-Shot Learning [3] uses a similar label propagation procedure as ours. However, while [3] uses standalone deep feature extractors, we show that our semi-supervised prototypical network can be trained completely end-to-end. One of the non-trivial results of our paper is that we show that end-to-end meta-learning significantly improves the performance (see Semi-supervised Inference vs. Soft K-means). We would like to emphasize that end-to-end semi-supervised learning in a meta-learning framework is, to the best of our knowledge, a novel contribution.\n\n\u201c...other na\u00efve baselines should also be compared...\u201d\nThe recent literature on few-shot learning has established that meta-learning-based approaches outperform kNN and standard neural network based approaches. For the Omniglot dataset, Mann et al. [4] has previously studied baselines such as KNN either in pixel space or deep features, and feedforward NNs. They found these baselines all lag behind their method by quite a lot, and meanwhile Prototypical Networks outperform Mann et al. by another significant margin. For example, Table 1 summarizes the performance for 5-shot, 5-way classification. Therefore, we will provide supervised nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and neural network baselines for completeness; however, we believe that our work is built on top of state-of-the-art methods, and should beat these simple baselines.\n\nTable 1 - Omniglot dataset baselines\nMethod             Accuracy\nKNN pixel          48%\nKNN deep         69%\nMann et al.

While in 5-shot the improvement is less, this is reasonable since the number of labeled items is larger and the benefit brought by unlabeled items is considerably smaller than in 1-shot settings. We disagree with the comment that our model is not robust under different datasets, since the best settings we found is consistent across all three, quite diverse, datasets, including the novel and much larger tieredImageNet.\n\nReferences:\n[1] \u201cVideo2vec embeddings recognize events when examples are scarce,\u201d IEEE TPAMI 2014\n[2] \u201cVideostory: A new multimedia embedding for few-example recognition and translation of events,\u201d in ACM MM, 2014.\n[3]: Transductive Multi-View Zero-Shot Learning, IEEE TPAMI 2015.\n[4]: One-shot learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks.

We\u2019d like to clarify our setup here: The problem as we have defined it is to correctly perform the given N-way classification in each episode (similarly as in the previous work). Distractors are introduced to make the problem harder in a more realistic way, but the goal is not to be able to classify them. Specifically, our model needs to understand which points are irrelevant for the given classification task (\u201cdistractors\u201d) in order to not take them into account, but actually classifying these distractors into separate categories is not required in order to perform the given classification task, so our models make no effort to do this.\n\nFurther, we would like to emphasize that adding distractor examples in few-shot classification settings is a novel and more realistic learning environment compared to previous approaches in supervised few-shot learning and as well as concurrent approaches in semi-supervised few-shot learning [1,2]. It is non-trivial to show that various versions of semi-supervised clustering can be trained end-to-end from scratch as another layer on top of prototypical networks, with the presence of distractor clusters  (note that each distractor class has the same number of images as a non-distractor class). \n\nReferences:\n[1]: Few-Shot Learning with Graph Neural Networks.

This is impactful as follow-up work can use our dataset as a public benchmark. In fact, there are several concurrent ICLR submissions and arxiv pre-prints [1,2] that also introduce semi-supervised few-shot learning. However compared to these concurrent papers, our benchmark extends beyond this work into more realistic and generic settings, with hierarchical class splits and unlabeled distractor classes, which we believe will make positive contributions to the community.\n\nThe fact that our semi-supervised prototypical network can be trained end-to-end from scratch is non-trivial, especially under many distractor clusters (note that each distractor class has the same number of images as a non-distractor class). We argue that our extension is simple yet effective, serving as another layer on top of the regular prototypical network layer, and provides consistent improvement in the presence of unlabeled examples. Further, to our knowledge, our best-performing method, the masked soft k-means, is novel.\n\n\u201cIt would be better to present accuracy\u2026\u201d\nThank you for the suggestion.

To address the concern, we are currently running other variants of the models such as a nearest neighbor baseline, and will report results before the ICLR discussion period ends. In the Omniglot dataset literature, many simple baselines has been extensively explored, and Prototypical Networks are so far the state-of-the-art.
