The AC understands the authors\u2019 argument that a simple method can be a feature and not a flaw, however this work still does not feel complete. Even within a relatively simple framework, it would be desirable to examine the problem from multiple angles and \"disentangle\" the effects of the different hypotheses \u2013 for example the reviewers have drawn attention to end-to-end training and comparison with other baselines.

We believe it is actually a desirable feature, and not a fault, that the proposed method is fairly straightforward and easy to implement. \n\nThe point about end-to-end training is well-taken. For simpler problems, like MNIST <-> MNIST, and MNIST<-> Fashion MNIST, end-to-end training is indeed tractable. However, we would like to highlight some advantages of the multi-step approach. First, this approach allows us to combine models that use dramatically different training procedures. We demonstrate that in this paper by transferring between a maximum-likelihood trained VAE and an adversarial-trained GAN.

Why do not the authors compare with CycleGAN in this paper?\u201d\n\nThank you for the observation that we could use better external baselines to compare against for domain transfer. We have added comparisons to pix2pix and CycleGAN for MNIST <-> Fashion MNIST. We find lower transfer accuracies and image quality (which we calculate with Frechet Inception Distance), which can be seen in Table 2 and Appendix C. The MNIST <-> MNIST scenario involved transferring between pretrained models with different initial conditions which is not directly comparable and has been omitted. In MNIST <-> SC09, the two domains were too distinct to provide any reasonable transfer with existing methods.\n\nAs we mentioned in the paper, we also tried to train a CycleGAN between latent spaces, but weren\u2019t unable to train the model at all, as the reconstruction loss was often trivially satisfied between models trained with the same Gaussian prior. This was an important finding for us, and gave us motivation to look at other methods for modeling transfer between latent spaces. \n\n> \u201cthe authors also need to compare with more state-of-the-art methods, such as StarGAN.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned above, thank you for pointing out the need for more baselines and we have now included comparisons to pix2pix and CycleGAN. We agree that StarGAN is an impressive model for multi-domain transfer, however, unlike the rest of the methods we compare, it requires additional target label information to be provided by the user at transfer time, which we feel makes CycleGAN a more natural comparison. Also, like CycleGAN, to the best of our knowledge these techniques still rely on structural similarities between domains and do not work as well for multi-modal transfer.\n\n> \u201cSome implementation details are not clearly stated. ...how many labeled samples are used in Table 2?\u201d\n\nAs part of the paper revisions, we have done our best to make all the implementation details more explicit. For example, in the caption table 2, we discuss that we use all available labels (60k for MNIST<-> Fashion MNIST, 16k for MNIST <-> SC09).
