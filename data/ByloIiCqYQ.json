However, most of the work in binary code vulnerability detection has relied on handcrafted features which are manually chosen by a select few, knowledgeable domain experts. In this paper, we attempt to alleviate this severe binary vulnerability detection bottleneck by leveraging recent advances in deep learning representations and propose the Maximal Divergence Sequential Auto-Encoder. In particular, latent codes representing vulnerable and non-vulnerable binaries are encouraged to be maximally divergent, while still being able to maintain crucial information from the original binaries. We conducted extensive experiments to compare and contrast our proposed methods with the baselines, and the results show that our proposed methods outperform the baselines in all performance measures of interest.", "keywords": ["Vulnerabilities Detection", "Sequential Auto-Encoder", "Separable Representation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "\n* Strengths\n\nThis paper applies deep learning to the domain of cybersecurity, which is non-traditional relative to more common domains such as vision and speech.

However, deep learning has only had limited applications in the cybersecurity domain, especially in the case of binary software vulnerability detection \u2014 an important and difficult problem in cybersecurity. The main reason is due to the lack of qualified binary datasets for the vulnerability detection task. Our contribution is to create a qualified binary dataset for this task and propose a new method that results in good performance. \n- It is arguable that the dataset is built upon an existing dataset with source code, hence the task of creating the binary dataset is perceived to be trivial. However, the various source codes in vulnerability detection are collected from many different software libraries, packages are always incomplete with many missing variables, data types, functions, class declarations and so on. Each missing code item might itself have large variations in its prototype and signature. Our tool needs to parse the source codes and be aware of the relationship between the missing code item/chunk and its role in order to fix the source code. Overall, this task can be quite complicated.\n- We believe that the two contributions alone justify the paper. The contributions are complementary, additive and they promote the study of deep learning (machine learning) for binary software vulnerability detection \u2014 an application of cybersecurity that is significantly challenging wherein deep learning (machine learning) has been restrictively applied. However, we have shown that deep learning can be successfully applied to this problem.\n\n* It would be great if the proposed approach also performs better on other vulnerability detection tasks than the baselines\n- In practice, binary vulnerability detection is more relevant and impactful than source code vulnerability detection. The reason is that when using a commercial application, we generally only possess its binary code and usually not its source code.  Because of license copyrights, the binary code cannot be decompiled back to the source code for vulnerability detection. We, therefore, need to detect vulnerabilities at the binary level. Our proposed method can also be adapted to source code vulnerability detection and we believe that the proposed method should perform better than the baselines in this application. In this paper, we mainly focus on binary vulnerability detection, which is harder and more applicable than source code vulnerability detection. As an aside, source code vulnerability detection should also have a better performance than the equivalent binary code vulnerability detection due to the fact that a lot of information (e.g., semantics) is stripped from the source code during compilation.\n\n* The performance of using hand-designed features on the same benchmark? If the proposed approach learns better embeddings, any intuition on what additional information is captured by the learned embeddings?\n- Grieco et al. 2016 proposed using dynamic features extracted from the execution of binaries and static features extracted from the binary programs and then trained a feed-forward neural network for classification. They undertook experiments using their own dataset VDiscovery with 1039 binaries. They claimed in that paper that they had to collect their own datasets because they found no suitable datasets to perform the evaluation of their technique. We cannot compare with this method because its code is not available.\n- The two key aspects that contribute to the success of our proposed model are i) the capability to reconstruct sequential binary codes from their latent representations via the VAE formulation and ii) the ability to maximize the divergence of latent representations by \u201cpushing away\u201d the two learnable priors. The first aspect ensures that the latent representations are able to capture the crucial information in the original binary codes. We observe that a vulnerable binary and its fixed version only differ by a few machine instructions, hence the ability to be able to reconstruct is important to differentiate a vulnerable binary and its fixed version in the latent space because the model needs to pay attention to the slight difference in vulnerable and fixed binaries to successfully reconstruct them. In addition, by maximizing the divergence between two learnable priors, the latent representations of vulnerable and non-vulnerable binaries are encouraged to be maximally divergent for classification purpose.\n", "title": "Response to AnonReviewer4"}, "SkeGRelT6X": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Skl_mb8yTX", "comment": "We are grateful for the reviewer\u2019s constructive comments.\n\n* The operation that creates dataset may introduce bias or variance. (The developed tool that automatically detects the syntactical errors in a given piece of source code, fixes them, and finally compiles the fixed source code into binaries, may change the distribution of data.) Why not follow the way of producing a dataset of malware detection or other tasks that using binary code.\n- The task of creating a binary dataset for vulnerability detection is much harder and complex compared to that of malware detection. For malware detection, one can easily collect infectious binaries, while vulnerable software code requires domain experts with relevant expertise to inspect the software and labeling them (identify the location(s) of the vulnerability, the vulnerability type etc.). Since binary codes are less informative and even experts are generally unable to label them directly, only vulnerable source codes are available. However, the process to collect vulnerable source code is labor-intensive and manual since one needs to go to the CVE website (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9989) and then navigate to relevant websites to manually collect the source code. Due to the nature of data collection, the various source codes in vulnerability detection are collected from many different software libraries, packages are always incomplete with many missing variables, data types, functions, class declarations and so on. Each missing code item might itself have large variations in its prototype and signature. Our tool needs to parse the source codes and be aware of the relationship between the missing code item/chunk and its role in order to fix the source code given the fact that the source codes have not compiled yet. It is worth noting that for compilable source code, one can use the ROSE parser (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROSE_(compiler_framework) ) to completely parse their structures. \n- To fix any source code, we first compiled the code using the gcc/g++ (MinGW) compiler and based on the error messages to gradually fix the code. For example, when the compiler gave an error message for a missing declaration of an identifier, our tool needs to parse the source code to understand the type of this identifier (e.g., a variable, data type, function, class) and then provide the declaration for this identifier. Still, the prototypes of data types, functions, and classes might be various enormously and be complex. Our automatic tool tackles these issues.\n- Our tool does not change the execution flow, semantic and syntactic structure of the source code which are crucial in identifying vulnerabilities. Thus, the fixing and compiling process does not affect vulnerabilities inside the source codes.\n\n* It seems that the proposed model fails to consider the properties of the binary codes in this task. It would be more interesting if some design incorporates the special properties of the task.\n- Source code has useful information with the syntax and semantic information provided by high-level programming languages and one can take advantage of the syntax and semantic information to construct tree structures like, for example, the abstract syntax tree. In contrast, a binary code has reduced syntax and semantic information wherein they can be only viewed as a sequence of machine instructions or bytes.\n- In our proposed method, the embedding component (see Section 3.1) of the machine instruction format was designed to capture the properties of the binary code. We observed a significant improvement in predictive performance when using this embedding technique instead of using a standard word embedding.  \n\n* The discussion in Figure 2 and equations are unclear. More explanations are needed. e.g. how to testing with label-unknown data.\n- The key aspects of our method are i) how to develop the sequential VAE to encode binaries and ii) how to maximize the latent codes of the different classes by \u201cpushing away\u201d the learnable priors. For testing a binary with an unknown label, we first feed it into the RNN encoder to work out its latent code and then use the classifier acting on the latent space to classify the binary. We will revise this technical section to clarify.\n\n* Many typos are found. E.g., : the given given  -> the given;    k = 1,2 should be k = 0,1 \n- Thanks.

Deep learning has enjoyed great success in the domains of computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, deep learning has only had limited applications in the cyber security domain, especially in the case of binary SVD \u2014 an important and difficult problem in cybersecurity. The reason is due to the scarcity of qualified datasets for source and binary code. For collecting vulnerable source code, one needs to access the CVE website and then navigate to the relevant websites to manually collect the source code. Due to the nature of data collection, the various source codes in vulnerability detection are collected from many different software libraries, packages are always incomplete with many missing variables, data types, functions, class declarations and so on. The challenge here is how to parse the source code to determine its structure given the fact that the source code has yet to be compiled. Note that for compilable source code, one can use the ROSE parser to completely parse the code \u2019s structure. \n- To fix any source code, we first compiled the code using the gcc/g++ (MinGW) compiler and based on the error messages to gradually fix the code.

Still, the prototypes of data types, functions, and classes might be various enormously and be complex. Our automatic tool tackles these issues. We provide more clarification and explanation of how our tool works in the appendix section of the revised version.\n\n* Necessity of SVD for binary codes\n- In practice, binary vulnerability detection (VD) is more relevant and impactful than source code vulnerability detection. The reason is that when using a commercial application, we generally only possess its binary code and usually not its source code.  Because of license copyrights, the binary code cannot be decompiled back to the source code for VD. We, therefore, need to detect vulnerabilities at the binary level.\n \n* SVD is easier from source code or from binary code?\n- Compared with source code VD, binary code VD is significantly more difficult because much of the syntax and semantic information provided by high-level programming languages is lost during the compilation process. For source code, one can take advantage of the syntax and semantic information to construct tree structures (e.g. abstract syntax tree). In contrast, a binary code has much less syntax and semantic information as they can be only viewed as a sequence of machine instructions or bytes.\n\n* The architecture in Fig.2\n- In Fig. 2, we used a simple RNN for demonstration purposes. However, we could use a Bidirectional RNN with GRU or LSTM cells. In our experiments, we employed a dynamic RNN with GRU cell.\n\n* Apply proposed method on other datasets or something maybe more specific to the task would be useful\n- Our proposed method is general enough for application to other popular problems like sentiment analysis. We proposed a specific embedding technique for binary SVD (see Sec. 3.1) where the format of machine instructions was considered.\n- In this work, we want to demonstrate the applicability of deep learning (or machine learning) to SVD \u2014 which is an important and complex problem in cybersecurity. With the dataset provision and preliminary experimental results, we hope to further encourage the application of deep learning (machine learning) to SVD and other cybersecurity applications.\n\n* Variational autoencoders are better models for the task\n- The two key aspects that contribute to the success of our proposed model are i) the capability to reconstruct sequential binary codes from their latent representations via the VAE formulation and ii) the ability to maximize the divergence of latent representations by \u201cpushing away\u201d the two learnable priors.

The authors created a compiled subset of the NDSS18 vulnerable vs. non-vulnerable software dataset (which is listed as one of their primary contributions). The dataset construction required non-trivial effort since example code snippets are often incomplete and the authors needed to \u201cfix\u201d these code examples in order to compile them. The fixed code examples are then compiled against both Windows and Linux and both the x86 and x86-64 architectures. The inputs to all predictive models are the opcode sequence of the compiled programs. \n\nThis paper compares against one previously published vulnerability detection method (VulDeePecker) which is a bidirectional RNN followed by a linear classifier. They also compare with a cascade of models with increasingly complex components:\n\n* RNN-R: A recurrent neural network trained in an unsupervised fashion (language modeling over opcode sequences), whose representations are then fed into an independent linear model. \n* RNN-C: End-to-end training of a recurrent model over opcodes, followed by a single dense layer.\n* Para2Vec: Encoding of the opcode sequence using the paragraph-to-vector architecture \u2014 I\u2019m curious what they used as the paragraph boundaries in the compiled programs and whether the subsequent classifier was the same as RNN-C. \n* SeqVAE-C: Sequential variational auto encoder trained end-to-end with a final classification layer. \n* MDSAE-RKL:  Maximal divergence sequential auto-encoder with KL divergence between the two class\u2019s latent distributions, final classifier trained independently. \n* MDSAE-RWS: Maximal divergence sequential auto-encoder with L2/Wasserstein  divergence between the two class\u2019s latent distributions, final classifier trained independently. \n* MDSAE-CKL: Maximal divergence sequential auto-encoder with KL divergence between the two class\u2019s latent distributions, final classifier included as the final layer of the whole model.\n* MDSAE-CWS: Maximal divergence sequential auto-encoder with L2/Wasserstein  divergence between the two class\u2019s latent distributions, final classifier included as the final layer of the whole model.\n\nThe two MDSAE models using Wasserstein divergence vastly outperform the two equivalent models using KL divergence. Another generalization that can be drawn from the evaluation is that models which are trained  with supervision end-to-end outperform those which train representation and classifier separately. \n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting and cool paper but I\u2019m not sure I actually buy into the basic premise that it makes sense to model vulnerable vs. non-vulnerable code as two different latent spaces.
