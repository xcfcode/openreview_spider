However, the structure of standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is simply a stack of fully connected layers, regardless of the feature correlations in data. In addition, the number of layers and the number of neurons are manually tuned on validation data, which is time-consuming and may lead to suboptimal networks. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised structure learning method for learning parsimonious deep FNNs. Our method determines the number of layers, the number of neurons at each layer, and the sparse connectivity between adjacent layers automatically from data. The resulting models are called Backbone-Skippath Neural Networks (BSNNs). Experiments on 17 tasks show that, in comparison with FNNs,  BSNNs can achieve better or comparable classification performance with much fewer parameters. The interpretability of BSNNs is also shown to be better than that of FNNs.", "keywords": ["Parsimonious Deep Feed-forward Networks", "structure learning", "classification", "overfitting", "fewer parameters", "high interpretability"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "I am inclined to agree with R1 that there is an extensive literature on learning architectures now, and I have seen two others as part of my area chairing.

The goal is to learn sparse structures across layers of fully connected networks.  Compared to prior work (hierarchical latent tree model), this work introduces skip-paths. \nAuthors refer to prior work for methods to learn this backbone model.

This will limit the applicability of the approach in most applications where fully connected networks are currently used. \n\nOriginality - The paper heavily builds upon prior work on hierarchical latent tree analysis and adds 'skip path' formulation to the architecture, however the structure learning is not performed end-to-end and in conjunction with the parameters. \n\nClarity - The paper is not self-contained in terms of methodology.\n\nQuality and Significance - There is a disconnect between premise of the paper (improving efficiency of fully connected layers by learning sparser structures) and applicability of the approach (slow EM based method to learn structure first, then learn the parameters).  As is, the applicability of the method is limited. \nAlso in terms of experiments, there is not enough exploration of simpler sparse learning methods such as heavy regularization of the weights.

The proposed method is focused on discovering sparse neural networks.  The experiments show that sparsity is achieved and still the discovered sparse networks have comparable or better performance compared to dense networks.\n\nThe main weakness of the paper is lack of cohesion in contributions and difficulty in delineating the scope of their proposed approach.\n\nBelow are some suggestions for improving the paper:\n\nCan you enumerate the paper\u2019s contributions and specify the scope of this work?  Where is this method most applicable and where is it not applicable?\n\nWhy is the paper focused on these specific contributions?  What problem does this particular set of contributions solve that is not solvable by the baselines?  There needs to be a cohesive story that puts the elements together.  For example, you explain how the algorithm for creating the backbone can use unsupervised data.  On the other hand, to distinguish this work from the baselines you mention that this work is the first to apply the method to supervised learning problems.\n\nThe motivation section in the beginning of the paper motivates using the backbone structure to get a sparse network.  However, it does not adequately motivate the skip-path connections or applications of the method to supervised tasks.\n\nIs this work extending the applicability of baselines to new types of problems?  Or is this work focused on improving the performance of existing methods?  Answers to these questions can automatically determine suitable experiments to run as well.  It's not clear if Pruned FNNs are the most suitable baseline for evaluating the results.  Can your work be compared experimentally with any of the constructive methods from the related work section?  If not, why?\n\nWhen contrasting this work with existing approaches, can you explain how existing work builds toward the same solution that you are focusing on?  It would be more informative to explain how the baselines contribute to the solution instead of just citing them and highlighting their differences.\n\nRegarding the experimental results, is there any insight on why the dense networks are falling short?  For example, if it is due to overfitting, is there a correlation between performance and size of FNNs?  Do you observe a similar performance vs FNNs in existing methods?  Whether this good performance is due to your contributions or due to effectiveness of the baseline algorithm, proper analysis and discussion is required and counts as useful research contribution.\n", "title": "Needs improvement", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "S1BSve3mz": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJ25hzHWf", "comment": "Thank you for your suggestions.", "title": "RE: AnonReviewer4's review"}, "BJna8g27G": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Bku44r3Mf", "comment": "Thank you for your explanations.\n\n#1\nNo. We are NOT \u201cusing some form of a cost function\u201d, but proposing an unsupervised learning method.

Please take a look at it. And we also compare with a baseline method (pruning) in our experiments.\n\n#Unclear tasks and unclear improvement#\nNo. Firstly, text classification is well studied in the literature and is not at all a mysterious task. In addition, the five large-scale text datasets we included are among the most important text classification datasets nowadays. The Tox21 dataset is also studied in a famous NIPS2017 paper, Self-Normalizing Neural Networks (SELU), in a similar setting. Secondly, we want to emphasize that the goal of this paper is NOT to propose state-of-the-art solutions to the 17 classification tasks, but to propose a structure learning method and compare it with baselines on the 17 tasks. Last but not the least, even when all the baseline FNN structures are fully tuned over the validation data, our method still achieves better/comparable classification performances in all the 17 tasks. This is a clear validation of the effectiveness of our structure learning method, considering the Backbone path in our model contains only 5% of the connections.\n\n#Paper on interpretable neural networks are not discussed#\nThe goal of this paper is to propose a structure learning method for *Parsimonious* neural networks such that the models contain fewer parameters than standard FNNs but still achieve better performance in different tasks. The method is not directly optimizing the structures for interpretability. Better interpretability (than baselines) is just one resulting advantage of our method and hence we think it is not necessary to include a heavy discussion on papers about interpretable neural networks.

One key advantage of unsupervised structure learning is that it can make use of both unlabelled and labelled data, and the learned structure can be transferred to any tasks on the same type of data. Think about the structure of convolutional layer which is used across all kinds of CV tasks. Why don't we train the connectivities of convolutional layer with the parameters in an end-to-end fashion? The reason is that we humans have seen many unlabelled scenes, we know a strong pattern in vision data and hence we design a specific structure suited to that pattern without further learning. Similarly, our method is trying to find such strong patterns in general data other than images and build structures correspondingly, followed by parameter learning in specific tasks. If you train the structure and parameters in an end-to-end manner, then it is supervised learning and task-specific, which is not what we want.\n\nIn addition, compared with an end-to-end method (pruning), our method has achieved higher classification AUC scores in 10 out of 12 tasks and significantly higher interpretability scores in 3 out of 4 tasks. It is clear that the end-to-end method shows no superiority to our method.\n\n#Originality#\nWe want to emphasize the contributions of our paper. Note that prior works on hierarchical latent tree analysis are proposing structure learning methods for Bayesian network, while in this paper we aim at structure learning of deep feed-forward neural networks.\n1. It is the first time that the latent tree-based structure learning method is applied to multi-layer neural network and supervised learning task (classification). Previous works on such topic are for unsupervised tasks only.\n2. This paper proposes a method for learning multi-layer deep sparse feed-forward neural network. This is different from previous works in that previous works on latent tree model learn either multi-layer tree model (Chen et al. 2017a) or two-layer sparse model Chen et al. (2017b).\n\n#Inefficient due to slow EM algorithm.#\nNo. Firstly, we use *Progressive EM* (Chen et al., 2016) and *Stepwise EM* (similar to SGD) (Sato and Ishii 2000; Cappe and Moulines 2009) in our method. They have been shown to be efficient and can easily scale up for hundreds of thousands of training samples in previous works. Secondly, structure learning is only needed during offline training, and the learned sparse connections can speed up online testing. Besides, our method is proposed not only for efficiency, but also for model fit and model storage.\n\n#Regularization of the weights as baseline are missing#\nNo. The pruning method we compare with is usually regarded as a strong regularization over weights in the literature. The regularization is even stronger than l1 norm as it is producing many weights being exactly 0.", "title": "RE: AnonReviewer3's review"}}}
