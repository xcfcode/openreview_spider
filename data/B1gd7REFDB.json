In this work, we propose a context-aware CNN (or conCNN for short) that for the first time effectively enforces the semantics context constraints in the CNN-based object detector by leveraging the popular conditional random field (CRF) model in CNN. In particular, conCNN features a context-aware module that naturally models the mean-field inference method for CRF using a stack of common CNN operations. It can be seamlessly plugged into any existing region-based object detection paradigm. Our experiments using COCO datasets showcase that conCNN improves the average precision (AP) of object detection by 2 percentage points, while only introducing negligible extra training overheads.", "keywords": ["Object Detection", "CNN", "Context", "CRF"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper proposes a contextual reasoning module following the approach proposed by the NIPS 2011 paper for object detection.

The reason is that compared to Relation Networks, we introduce many fewer additional parameters to the original Faster R-CNN model to enforce the semantics constraints.

More specifically, the average precision of conCNN is 39.48, while the average precision of Faster R-CNN + Relation is 38.6. Moreover, our model is much simpler than Relation Networks. As shown in our experiments,  the training time of our model is 27.25 hours \u2013 only 0.75 hours longer than the Faster R-CNN which takes 26.5 hours, while the Relation Network takes 32.25 hours to train. The reason is that compared to Relation Network, we introduce many fewer additional parameters to the original Faster R-CNN model to enforce the semantics context constraints. In addition, based on experiments, our model is also more stable than Relation Networks -- we always converge to an average precision higher than that of Faster R-CNN, while we have to carefully tune Relation Networks to beat the Faster R-CNN baseline. In short, our model is simpler yet more accurate and stable than Faster R-CNN. So we do believe our work pushes the state-of-the-art forward. \n\nWe are also running new experiments on the LVIS dataset per the suggestion of Reviewer 1. This dataset is challenging. It will still take us additional time to make sure that the comparison is fair and convincing before we can comfortably report the results.", "title": "Response to Reviewer 2: The significance of our work"}, "Sylu28cFYB": {"type": "review", "replyto": "B1gd7REFDB", "review": "This paper introduces a context-aware neural network (conCNN) that integrates context semantics into account for object detection. The proposed approach achieves this by embedding a context-aware module into the Faster R-CNN detection framework. The context-aware module simulates the learning process of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model using a stack of common CNN operations. Specifically, this paper employs the mean-field approach of [1]. Experiments are performed on COCO dataset.\n\nThe  paper reads well. The idea of combining the strengths of both CNNs and CRF-based graphical models in a detection framework is interesting. Though the main idea is borrowed from the mean-field approach of [1], it has been successfully reformulated as a stack of common CNN layers. However, my main concern is that the experimental results (Page 8 Table 2) does not support the merits of the proposed approach. When comparing with the existing Faster R-CNN + Relation work of [2], the improvement provided by the proposed approach is negligible. In fact the proposed approach achieves inferior results on large objects (APL), compared to [2]. [1] uses attention to model the geometric relationships among objects in the same image. In addition to geometric relationships, the proposed approach leverages the inherent co-occurence relationships between object classes. However, this additional information does not seem to provide much help by looking at the results on COCO dataset. The paper does present an experiment to justify this additional information in Table 1. However, that small experiment is only on 6 object categories and does not seem to generalize when going towards full COCO dataset with 80 categories (Table 2). Therefore, the reviewer would recommend to thoroughly evaluate the merits of the proposed approach in depth on COCO and on additional datasets (i.e., Visual Genome). \n\n[1] Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, Vladlen Koltun: Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials.

If the categories are supplied with a lot of training examples, it is very hard for context to really help there. I would at least stick to full set of COCO (I am fine with reducing the number of training images), or switch to the recently proposed LVIS dataset:\nhttps://www.lvisdataset.org/\n- I think the work did a less comprehensive literature survey for object detection with context reasoning.

In particular for the two-stage region-based detector, like Faster RCNN, the context module is added right before the output layer of the classification head.

Potentials are defined based on object detector outputs, box overlap, and co-occurrence of class labels. Experiments are performed on the MS COCO object detection task. \n\nThe proposed method is similar to the CRF-based method for FCN segmentation networks except that the nodes are boxes instead of pixels.
