Biological networks, on the other hand, appear to lack any mechanism for sending gradients back to their input neurons, and thus cannot be learning in this way. In response to this, Scellier & Bengio (2017) proposed Equilibrium Propagation - a method for gradient-based train- ing of neural networks which uses only local learning rules and, crucially, does not rely on neurons having a mechanism for back-propagating an error gradient. Equilibrium propagation, however, has a major practical limitation: inference involves doing an iterative optimization of neural activations to find a fixed-point, and the number of steps required to closely approximate this fixed point scales poorly with the depth of the network. In response to this problem, we propose Initialized Equilibrium Propagation, which trains a feedforward network to initialize the iterative inference procedure for Equilibrium propagation. This feed-forward network learns to approximate the state of the fixed-point using a local learning rule. After training, we can simply use this initializing network for inference, resulting in a learned feedforward network. Our experiments show that this network appears to work as well or better than the original version of Equilibrium propagation. This shows how we might go about training deep networks without using backpropagation.", "keywords": ["credit assignment", "energy-based models", "biologically plausible learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper investigates a novel initialisation method to improve Equilibrium Propagation.

Specifically, it trains a feedforward network to initialize the iterative optimization process in equilibrium prop, leading to greater stability and computational efficiency, and providing a network that can later be used for fast feedforward predictions on test data. Non-local gradient terms are dropped when training the feedforward network, so that the entire system still doesn't require backprop. There is a neat theoretical result showing that, in the neighborhood of the optimum, the dropped non-local gradient terms will be correlated with the retained gradient terms.\n\nMy biggest concern with this paper is the lack of significant literature review, and that it is not placed in the context of previous work. There are only 12 references, 5 of which come from a single lab, and almost all of which are to extremely recent papers. Before acceptance, I would ask the authors to perform a literature search, update their paper to include citations to and discussion of previous work, and better motivate the novelty of their paper relative to previous work. Luckily, this is a concern that is addressable during the rebuttal process! If the authors perform a literature search, and update their paper appropriately, I will raise my score as high as 7.\n\nHere are a few related topic areas which are currently not discussed in the paper. *I am including these as a starting point only! It is your job to do a careful literature search. I am completely sure there are obvious connections I'm missing, but these should provide some entry points into the citation web.*\n- The \"method of auxiliary coordinates\" introduces soft (often quadratic) couplings between post- and pre- activations in adjacent layers which, like your distributed quadratic penalty, eliminate backprop across the couplings. I believe researchers have also done similar things with augmented Lagrangian methods. A similar layer-local quadratic penalty also appears in ladder networks.\n- Positive/negative phase (clamped / unclamped phase) training is ubiquitous in energy based models. Note though that it isn't used in classical Hopfield networks. You might want to include references to other work in energy based models for both this and other reasons. e.g., there may be some similarities between this approach and continuous-valued Boltzmann machines?\n- In addition to feedback alignment, there are other approaches to training deep neural networks without standard backprop. examples include: synthetic gradients, meta-learned local update rules, direct feedback alignment, deep Boltzmann machines, ...\n- There is extensive literature on biologically plausible learning rules -- it is a field of study in its own right. As the paper is motivated in terms of biological plausibility, it would be good to include more general context on the different approaches taken to biological plausibility.\n\nMore detailed comments follow:\n\nThank you for including the glossary of symbols!\n\n\"Continuous Hopfield Network\" use lowercase for this (unless introducing acronym)\n\n\"is the set non-input\" -> \"is the set of non-input\"\n\n\"$\\alpha = ...$ ... $\\alpha_j \\subset ...$\" I could not make sense of the set notation here.\n\nwould recommend using something other than rho for nonlinearity. rho is rarely used as a function, so the prior of many readers will be to interpret this as a scalar. phi( ) or f( ) or h( ) are often used as NN nonlinearities.\n\ninline equation after \"clamping factor\" -- believe this should just be C, rather than \\partial C / \\partial s.\nMove definition of \\mathcal O up to where the symbol is first used.\n\ntext before eq. 7 -- why train to approximate s- rather than s+?

And wasn't the nonlinearity earlier introduced as rho? Should settle on one symbol for the nonlinearity.\n\nThis result is very cool. It only holds in the neighborhood of the optimum though.

The only hyperparameter that we tuned was the scale of the initial weights / target-network weights, and that was tuned to ensure approximately equal activation magnitudes for each layer (so that activations neither die out or saturate with depth).  The network had 8 layers (including input) of 200 units, training was done with SGD with learning rate of 0.01 and momentum of 0.9, but the results look the same with other optimizers we tried (Adagrad, Adamax). When we used no adaptation in the step size (ie momentumless SGD), the local started off slower (presumably because the gradients were simply smaller), but then overtook the global optimiser.\n\n- \"I'm pretty sure this is not an accurate statement about the method of auxiliary coordinates?\"\n\nYou are correct, I'd misread the Z-step of MAC to be sample-local but layer-global, when in fact it is both sample-local and (sort of) layer local (still involves backprop across one layer).  We will update the draft for the final.  Thank you for pointing that out. \n\n- \"Can you say more about why you would expect the gradients to be aligned at initialization?\"\n\nIt comes down to the fact that for a random matrix w, <x, x w w^T> will tend to be positive.  At random initialization, a component of d_L1/d_w1 and a component of  d_L2/d_w1 are related by a (w w^T) term, so tend to be positively aligned.  We have posted an (anonymous) explanation here, and will add it to the appendix: https://srv-file1.gofile.io/download/VfLgmv/2ceb9fae950fd7ab1b532534f4cd2435/Why-Alignment-at-Init.pdf \n\nIn any case, the initial local-distant alignment is not that important, because even if it were random, the local gradient will still be aligned with the *global* gradient (which is the local+distant gradient) initially.  So from the start, phi is being pushed towards phi*, which in turn leads to an increased local-distant alignment.\n\n- \"Another thread of references that comes to mind, for biologically plausible local learning rules\"...\n\nThank you for the paper.

To achieve this, the authors propose to train a feedforward network to predict a fixed point of the \"equilibrating network\". Gradients are approximated by local gradients only. The method is compared to standard EP on MNIST.\n\nThe overall idea of the paper to speed up the slow iterative inference (during training and deployment) seems very reasonable. However, the paper seems to be still work in progress and could be improved on the theoretical side, the presentation, and especially the experimental evaluation. \nThe paper is rather weak on the theoretical side. The main theoretical result is perhaps the analysis of the gradient alignment. However, I cannot follow their analysis and suspect that it is false. More detailed comments follow. Regarding the presentation, I found many typos which I don't consider in my evaluation. However, there are both minor and major issues with several equations. Details follow below. Another major concern is the lack of experimental evaluation. There is only a single plot that shows the learning curves of EP and the proposed Initialized EP with 2 different numbers of negative-phase steps and for 2 different architectures. The authors should put a lot more effort into the evaluation. For example, evaluate the influence of the hyperparameter in Eq. (10) (Is lambda > 0 detrimental to the capacity of the equilibrating network?), etc.\n\nLastly, as of my current understanding, the whole motivation for the EP framework is biological plausibility. In my opinion, this paper lacks a discussion of that motivation with respect to the proposed approach.\n\nTo summarize, there are too many major problems that cannot be addressed only in the rebuttal phase. \n\n\nDetails:\n- Sec. 1.1. Equilibrium Propagation --> Sec. 2 (It is not part of the introduction) \n- In 1.1., \"Equilibrium Propagation is a method for training a Continuous Hopfield Network for classification\". EP is a method for training various energy-based models, not just hopfield networks. \n- Eq. (1): I find the notation very confusing. Specifically, I can't make sense of:\n    a) \"$\\alpha = \\{\\alpha_j: j \\in  S\\}$ denotes the network architecture\". What does it mean for alpha to denote an architecture? Please be more specific. \n    b) In the definition of $\\alpha_j$, you are constructing a set of neurons $i \\in S  \\cup I$, but then you are re-defining i in the same set, using the forall operator. \n    c) Even if the two above is corrected, I can't follow. Please simplify the notation (the energy function is not that complicated).\n- Eq. (1): Why is it $i \\in S$ everywhere, rather than all neurons, including input neurons (as in [Scellier and Bengio 2017])? \n- The text between Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) introduces the classification targets by adding the gradients of another energy function $C(s_O, y)$ to the previously described energy function from Eq. (1). First $C(s_O, y)$ is nowhere defined. Second, The energy is a scalar, while the gradient is a vector, so there must be a mistake. I suppose it should be just $C(s_O, y)$ rather than its gradients?\n- Eq. (6): $f_{\\phi_{j}}$ is defined as a function of multiple $f_{\\phi_{i}}$ ? \n- Eq. (9): Again the index i is used twice. \n- Sec. 2.1: Can you elaborate on why the equilibrating network can create targets that are not achievable by the feedforward network? Is it a problem of your particular choice of model architecture? Isn't the \"regularization\" then detrimental to the (capacity of the) equilibrating network? \n- In Sec. 2.2 on page 5, you claim that given random parameter intitialization, the gradients should almost always be aligned. For random weight matrices, where the weights are drawn with zero mean, I cannot see how this is true. To compute gradients of layer $l$, backpropagation (in an MLP) computes the matrix-vector multiplication between transposed weight matrix and the gradients of layer l+1 (I am ignoring the activation function here). The resulting gradient should have zero mean.\n- Eq. (11): Is it the L1 Norm or L2?\n- Eq. (12): In the preceding text, you made claims about the gradient alignment for random parameter initialization. In Eq. (12) you analyze the gradients close to the optimum?\n- Eq. (12): What is f, it has never been defined. I suppose it should be the h from above? \n- Eq. (12): I don't understand how you arrived at these gradient equations, even the first one. Shouldn't it be the standard backpropagation in an MLP or am I missing something? Using the chain rule $\\frac{\\partial L_1}{\\partial w_1} = \\frac{\\partial L_1}{\\partial s_1} \\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial w_1}$, I arrive at a different result. How can there be the derivative of f (or h) twice.\n- Sec. 3: Is beta really sampled from a zero-centred uniform distribution? On page 2, beta is introduced as a small positive number. Would a negative beta not cause the model to settle to a fixed point where maximally wrong targets are predicted?\n\n\n[Scellier and Bengio 2017] Equilibrium Propagation: Bridging the Gap Between Energy-Based Models and Backpropagation", "title": "review initialized equilibrium propagation", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "rkenvhdtA7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "ryeI_q3v3Q", "comment": "Thank you for your flexible review system which incentivized us to do a proper exploration of related work!  In response to your concern, we have significantly expanded the related work section.  We now mention what we think is an important link to amortized variational inference.  We have also simplified notation in response to your other comments.  Below we respond to some of your more detailed comments:\n\n---\n- \u201cwould recommend using something other than rho for nonlinearity. rho is rarely used as a function, so the prior of many readers will be to interpret this as a scalar. phi( ) or f( ) or h( ) are often used as NN nonlinearities.\u201d\n\nIn Equilibrium Propagation and other related papers rho is used as the nonlinearity.  So we would like to keep rho here in order to be consistent with those papers.\n----\n- \u201cwhy train to approximate s- rather than s+? It seems like s+ would lead to higher accuracy when this is eventually used for inference.\u201d\n\nGood observation - we added a footnote to address it: We could also minimize the distance with s+, but found experimentally that this actually works slightly worse than s\u2212. We believe that this is because equilibrium propagation depends on the s\u2212 being very close to a true minimum of the energy function, and so initializing the negative phase to sf\u2248s\u2212 will lead to better gradient computations than when we initialize the negative phase to sf\u2248s+\n\n----\n\n- \u201ceq. 10 -- doesn't the regularization term also decrease the expressivity of the Hopfield network? e.g. it can no longer engage in \"explaining away\" or enforce top-down consistency, both of which are powerful positive attributes of iterative estimation procedures.\u201d\n\nIt does potentially reduce the expressivity, for the reasons you describe.  We now expand a bit about that in Section 2.3.  However, our primary concern here is to train a feedforward network without backpropagation, so we already accept that we\u2019re producing a model with the expressivity of a feedforward network.  That said, because of concerns about this, we add an experiment in Appendix C where we run training to completion for various swept values of lambda.  We do observe that too-high a lambda causes eq.prop to become unstable and fail, but we do not observe what we might expect if constrained-expressivity were a problem: (i.e. the error for s^f decreasing and the error for s- increasing with increased lambda).  \n\n----\n\n- \u201cThis result is very cool. It only holds in the neighborhood of the optimum though. At initialization, I believe the expected correlation is zero by symmetry arguments (eg, d L_2 / d s_2 is equally likely to have either sign). Should include an explicit discussion of when this relationship is expected to hold.\u201d\n\nThank you!  We also found it unintuitive at first.  Even at random initialization the gradient alignment S(d_L1/d_phi1, d_L2/d_phi1) is in general NOT zero-mean.  For a randomly initialized network, d_L2/d_phi1 and d_L1/d_phi1 are both zero-mean random variables (for the reason you mention - that d_L2/d_s2 is equally likely to have either sign), but they are not independent - they are both functions of phi1, and this dependency induces alignment.  We\u2019ve changed Figure to demonstrate that the initially weak alignment becomes stronger as training progresses (and phi approaches phi*), and added a derivation of the alignment result in Appendix B.\n\n----\n- \"proportional to\" -> \"correlated with\" (it's not proportional to)\n\nOur statement is \u201cwhen the term is proportional to an identity matrix, we see that dL1/dw1 and G1 are perfectly aligned\u201d.  This is true: we\u2019re just describing the case in which ideal alignment happens, not saying that in a normal situation it\u2019s proportional.  \n. ---\n\n- \u201cFigure 2 -- how does the final achieved test error change with the number of negative-phase steps? ie, is the final classification test error better even for init eq prop in the bottom row than it is in the top?\u201d\n\nWe modified Figure 2 to show the scores.  Answer is no, once there are enough negative steps for training to be stable, the forward pass doesn\u2019t become more accurate with additional steps.  \n", "title": "Response"}, "rkxaD5dY07": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "r1eOy7xKhQ", "comment": "Thank you for your helpful review.  We agree with all the points you made, and have addressed them in the paper.  Below we address some of your questions individually:\n----\n\n- \u201cMy main concern is with the mathematical argument in section 2.2. s* is not the same as s- , and in general, it is not clear at all that there should be a phi* such that s*=s-. Also, the derivation in eqn 12 assumes that w is very close to w*, which is not clear at al\u201d \u2026  I don't think that this is a deal-breaker, but I think that this section needs to be more prudent in the way that it concludes from these observations (the math and the experiments).\n\nThis is definitely a valid concern.  We\u2019ve added a paragraph to the end of this section (now 2.4) addressing your point.  We also mention that in future work, this problem could be dealt-with by figuring out a smart way to anneal the lambda-term (Introduced in now-section 2.3: Including the forward states in the energy function) in a way that does not harm training of the equilibrating network.  We note that in the limit of lambda -> infinity, s-=sf, and so the targets provided by the equilibrating network are achievable by the forward network.  However we observe experimentally (see added experiment in Appendix C) that setting lambda too high can cause training instabilities.  \n\n-----\n\n- \u201cOne question I have is about biological plausibility. The whole point of EqProp was to produce a biologically plausible variation on backprop. How plausible is it to have two sets of weights for the feedforward and recurrent parts? That is where a trick such as proposed in Bengio et al 2016 might be useful, so that the same set of weights could be used for both.\u201d\n\nWe felt that the most natural thing to do in this work was not to tie the parameters of the feedforward and inference network. This is more in line with the amortized variational inference view - where the variational encoder network typically does not share parameters with the generative model.  However, we agree that in terms of biological plausibility, it makes more sense that the feedforward network would share parameters with the equilibrating, as in [Bengio et al 2016].  This, however, was not the aspect of biologically plausible deep learning that we aim to attack in this paper.  The big problem, as we see it, is that the brain does not use backpropagation, yets seems to train fast inference networks.  Once that is solved, we can attack the other aspects of biological plausibility.\n\nWe have also added some emphasis in the Discussion section on the other motivation for this work - the design of future hardware for deep learning.  This work could be a useful starting point for the design of an efficient analog circuit for training feedforward networks.  \n\n----\n- \u201cIt might be good to mention Bengio et al 2016 in the introduction since it is the closest paper (trying to solve the same problem of using a feedforward net to approximate the true recurrent computation), rather than pushing that to the end.\u201c\n\nWe agree the this paper is very relevant, but couldn\u2019t find it a way to work it into the introduction without having to explain the idea prematurely.  We agree that it should be more emphasized here, so we\u2019ve moved our mention of it to the beginning of the related work section.  \n\n", "title": "Response"}, "rye_pK_YAm": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B1gzOC6Wa7", "comment": "Thank you for doing such a detailed review of our work.  We have addressed all of your points in our paper.  We have used your feedback to simplify notation, add two experiments, and better support the theoretical analysis in the text.  We hope that our changes allay your concerns, and we appreciate time and effort you put into reviewing and improving our paper.  \n\n----\n\n- \u201cEq. (1): Why is it $i \\in S$ everywhere, rather than all neurons, including input neurons (as in [Scellier and Bengio 2017])? \u201c\n\nThe phrasing eq. 1 of in  [Scellier and Bengio 2017] is slightly imprecise, because in reality no nonlinearity is applied to the input.  We instead separate out the input terms from the other terms in the network.  This also allows us to just use \u201cs\u201d to describe the state of the network, and not need the additional vector \u201cu\u201d to describe \u201cthe state of the network AND the inputs:\u201d.  \n\n----\n\n- \u201cSec. 2.1: Can you elaborate on why the equilibrating network can create targets that are not achievable by the feedforward network? Is it a problem of your particular choice of model architecture? Isn't the \"regularization\" then detrimental to the (capacity of the) equilibrating network? \u201c\n- \u201c For example, evaluate the influence of the hyperparameter in Eq. (10) (Is lambda > 0 detrimental to the capacity of the equilibrating network?)\u201d\n\nI rewrote this section (now numbered 2.3) to clarify why the function of the equilibrating network is more \u201cflexible\u201d than that of the feedforward network.  You are correct that the \u201cregularization\u201d is then detrimental to the capacity of the equilibrating network, but that is not important if our objective is just to use the equilibrating network to train the feedforward network.  \n\nWe added a new experiment in Appendix C where we sweep lambda to demonstrate its effect.\n\n---\n\n\u201cIn Sec. 2.2 on page 5, you claim that given random parameter intitialization, the gradients should almost always be aligned. For random weight matrices, where the weights are drawn with zero mean, I cannot see how this is true. To compute gradients of layer $l$, backpropagation (in an MLP) computes the matrix-vector multiplication between transposed weight matrix and the gradients of layer l+1 (I am ignoring the activation function here). The resulting gradient should have zero mean.\u201d\n\nThe alignment effect is real, just somewhat intuitive.  It may help to think of it this way:  For a random network with parameters phi, with targets assigned by another random network with parameters phi*, the gradients d_L1/d_phi1 and d_L2/d_phi1 are indeed zero-mean random variables.  But they are not independent.  Both of these gradients depend on phi1.  Our analysis shows that when we are close to the ideal parameters (ie when phi is close to phi*), this dependency tends to produce to a positive correlation between the two gradients.  \n\nTo increase the reader\u2019s confidence in this point, we have added a full derivation in Appendix B, and Figure 1 and 3, which demonstrate this alignment effect empirically.\n\n---- \n\n- \u201cEq. (12): I don't understand how you arrived at these gradient equations, even the first one. <\u2026.>  How can there be the derivative of f (or h) twice.\u201d\n\nWe added a full derivation in Appendix B.  The squared-derivative arises from us us doing a first-order Taylor expansion to calculate the derivative in the limit of small Delta_w.  We did, discover that we\u2019d had an accidental a minus-sign in our equation, which we have corrected.  We have also tested them numerically (see anonymous test script at https://pastebin.com/RRgcCnrb )\n\n-----\n\n- \u201cSec. 3: Is beta really sampled from a zero-centred uniform distribution? On page 2, beta is introduced as a small positive number. Would a negative beta not cause the model to settle to a fixed point where maximally wrong targets are predicted?\u201d\n\nYes, but the learning rate is also multiplied by beta, so when it is negative it tries to raise the energy of the \u201cmaximally wrong\u201d targets.  I have added a footnote explaining why this is done (it is a trick inherited from [Scellier & Bengio, 2017]).  \n\n----\n\n- \u201cLastly, as of my current understanding, the whole motivation for the EP framework is biological plausibility. In my opinion, this paper lacks a discussion of that motivation with respect to the proposed approach.\u201d\n\nWe are still many steps away from full biological plausibility.  But one of the main gaps in between Deep-Learning models and our understanding of the brain is that the brain clearly does not use backprop.  We think that addressing this issue alone (how to train a feedforward network without backprop) is sufficient scope for this paper. \n\nMoreover, there is a second motivation: Equilibrium Propagation could lead to efficient neural networks implementations in analog hardware.  However, it still requires a settling process, which is not ideal for fast inference.  We address exactly that concern.

This allows faster run-time, which is practically very useful.\n\nMy main concern is with the mathematical argument in section 2.2. s* is not the same as s- , and in general, it is not clear at all that there should be a phi* such that s*=s-. Also, the derivation in eqn 12 assumes that w is very close to w*, which is not clear at all. So this derivation is more suggestive, and the empirical results are the ones which could be convincing. My only concern there is that the only experiments performed are on MNIST, which is known to be easily dealt with using the kind of feedforward architectures studied here. Things could break down if much more non-linearity (which is what the fixed point recurrence provides) is necessary (equivalently this would correspond to networks for which much more depth is necessary, given some budget of number of parameters). I don't think that this is a deal-breaker, but I think that this section needs to be more prudent in the way that it concludes from these observations (the math and the experiments).\n\nOne question I have is about biological plausibility. The whole point of EqProp was to produce a biologically plausible variation on backprop. How plausible is it to have two sets of weights for the feedforward and recurrent parts? That is where a trick such as proposed in Bengio et al 2016 might be useful, so that the same set of weights could be used for both.\n\nIt might be good to mention Bengio et al 2016 in the introduction since it is the closest paper (trying to solve the same problem of using a feedforward net to approximate the true recurrent computation), rather than pushing that to the end.\n\nIn sec. 1.1, I would replace 'training a Continuous Hopfield Network for classification' by 'energy-based models, with a recurrent net's updates corresponding to gradient descent in the energy'. The EqProp algorithm is not just for the Hopfield energy but is general. Then before eq 1, mention that this is the variant of Hopfield energy studied in the EqProp paper.\n\nI found a couple of typos (scenerio, of the of the).\n\n\n", "title": "Init EqProp", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}}}
