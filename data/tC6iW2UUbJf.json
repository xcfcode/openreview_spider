Notably, recent work on unsupervised pretraining has shown to surpass the supervised counterpart for finetuning downstream applications such as object detection and segmentation.   It comes as a surprise that image annotations would be better left unused for transfer learning.  In this work, we investigate the following problems: What makes instance discrimination pretraining good for transfer learning? What knowledge is actually learned and transferred from these models?  From this understanding of instance discrimination, how can we better exploit human annotation labels for pretraining? Our findings are threefold. First, what truly matters for the transfer is low-level and mid-level representations, not high-level representations.  Second, the intra-category invariance enforced by the traditional supervised model weakens transferability by increasing task misalignment. Finally, supervised pretraining can be strengthened by following an exemplar-based approach without explicit constraints among the instances within the same category.", "keywords": ["Transfer Learning", "Unsupervised Learning", "Self-supervised Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper aims at understanding why self-supervised/contrastive learning methods  transfer well when used as pretraining for fine-tuning downstream tasks  (compared to e.g., supervised pretraining based on the cross-entropy loss).

Do authors have any intuition on that? \n\nIn Figure 2, we examine three typical contrastive models (InstDisc, MoCo, SimCLR) on their ability to reconstruct the input image. The conclusion of preserving holistic information holds with these three models.  \n\nFor the rest of the transfer studies, though we are optimistic about generality, we are sorry that we cannot provide reliable experiments at this stage. For SimCLR, the original paper does not report the transfer protocol as well as the results for detection and segmentation. To the best of our efforts, we failed to obtain a competitive number using SimCLR compared with supervised pretrained models. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer on this promising direction to examine other self-supervised methods.    \n\n\nQ2: Some Table references might be wrong.

Traditional cross-entropy supervised pretraining may lose spatial information when pretrained to recognize faces, causing sub-optimal results for face landmark transfer. We introduce this in order to show that our proposed exemplar-based pretraining may mitigate the negative effect of supervised pretraining.

This paper would be much stronger if it was reorganized to focus on the key take-away in this paper. \n\nThe single focus of the paper is to answer the question \u2013 why contrastive learning transfers so well for downstream tasks. The empirical evidence from data augmentations, dataset semantics as well as task misalignments all shed light on this central problem. With insights and understandings from these studies, a straightforward implication for supervised pretraining is to use negatives without positives. The consistent improvements for the new supervised pretraining approach validate our prior findings about task misalignments for transfer learning. While the paper presents a spectrum of content, we believe all messages conveyed in the paper are tightly targeted to a central problem. \n\n \nQ2: What is the definition of low, mid, and high-level features? \n\nIn this paper, we mainly distinguish high-level features from the others. Features are high-level if they pertain to the semantics of a particular dataset. In Table 2, since we manipulate the semantics of the datasets (e.g., faces, objects, scenes), we may control the high-level features that could be learned.  Features learned from solely faces cannot represent general high-level objects. In the paper, we do not further distinguish between low and mid-level features.

In contrast, unsupervised transfers are mostly agnostic to the semantics of the pretraining data. For example, on VOC object detection, supervised transfer drops sharply from 46.2 (ImageNet pretrain) to 39.1 (places pretrain), while unsupervised pretrain drops just marginally from 48.5 (ImageNet pretrain) to 46.7 (places pretrain).

Authors analyse in detail the difference in performance between self-supervised and supervised pretraining and propose a new method to train model which improves over standard supervised models when used as pretraining.\n\nStrengths:\n\n- I think the paper addresses a relevant problem. Understanding difference between self-supervised and supervised pretraining is relevant to advance in this field. I particularly like the amount of evidence the paper provides to back all the claims, and the originality of some of the experiments such as Figure 2.\n\n- The paper is well written and motivates the issue very well. I think it's particularly interesting to question traditional training techniques such as cross-entropy training, when the models are planed to be used for a different goal.\n\n- The insights of the transferability experiments are useful for the community as point the strengths and weaknesses of each methods. I think it's good that authors analyse many different tasks such as classification, detection and segmentation with variate datasets. \n\n- The proposed learning loss utilising the labels to produce the negatives is simple and seems to produce promising results according to Table 4 and Table 5. \n\n- The extensive supplementary materials are also useful for additional information.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- It would have been interesting to see whether this presented results comparing MoCo with supervised pretraining hold with other self-supervised methods such as SimCLR. Do authors have any intuition on that? Are some of those effects from the particularities of the MoCo training or can we generalise to all self-supervised methods?\n\n- Some Table references might be wrong.

They explore a number of different transfer tasks to give some intuition:\n1.  Interesting findings:\n - Augmentation doesn\u2019t make much difference for supervised transfer (from imagenet) and is essential for unsupervised transfer, with the effect monotonically increasing as more augmentations are added.\n - Dataset semantics are less important for unsupervised pretraining:  They transfer from a variety of tasks, faces, objects, etc using supervised and unsupervised pretraining.\n - Imagenet pretraining leads to greater localization errors (using analysis of Hoiem 2012), and  more generally a loss of spatial information (tested via image reconstruction)\n2. Propose a new supervised pretraining method to combine the idea of unsupervised contrastive training with supervised exemplar training. \n - Extend MoCo to use supervised labels so the loss doesn\u2019t contrast examples from the same class.\n - This improves supervised transfer performance from ImageNet to the other tasks.  \n3. Finally, they look at the impact of this new pretraining on two other tasks\n - Few shot learning: The Supervised Exemplar model outperforms the unsupervised methods, and the original cross-entropy Imagenet supervised model.\n - Facial landmark prediction: Both the unsupervised and exemplar-supervised pretraining perform similarly and outperform either training from scratch or imagenet-supervised pretraining.  This again supports the observation that imagenet classification pretraining dilutes the spatial acuity of the model.\n\n**Positives:**\n- They introduce a supervised pretraining method that can transfer better than the unsupervised method and the original supervised imagenet method.\n- Overall, this work is clearly written.\n- Ultimately, I do believe I have a better understanding of the differences between the supervised and unsupervised pretrained models.\n\n**Negatives:**\n- The major insight into the differences is limited:  mainly that we pay a price when the low-level information is lost by the supervised pretrained model. \n\n**Recommendation:**\nThese analysis papers are always tricky to rate -- often quite a bit of work goes into what seems like a small insight (maybe even obvious in retrospect).  However, I do think that this work is worthwhile for the community because 1) it shines light on a somewhat mysterious exciting new technique and 2) already shows how the findings are useful by using it to improve supervised pretraining, and a new vocabulary for evaluating pretraining techniques.\n\n**Minor comments:**\nEq (2), should $v_i$ be $q_i$?\n", "title": "What Makes Instance Discrimination Good for Transfer Learning?", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "WpyoPr4hJsa": {"type": "review", "replyto": "tC6iW2UUbJf", "review": "Summary:\n\nThe paper draws an interesting research question: why instance discrimination (ID) pretraining good for transfer learning? \nThe authors dissect ID for transfer learning by extensively comparing with supervised pretraining in several task combinations, so that they attempted to empirically answer what knowledge is learned by ID and transferred, what is differences with supervised pretraining, and when it is effective according to task relationships and dataset sizes.\nBased on their findings, they propose a new supervised pretraining method, which has a good trade-off for transfer learning applications, and validates with other contexts such as few-shot classification and landmark localization.\n\nThe message has been deemed by researchers, but this paper shows empirical evidence with extensive experiments.
