The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components. Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units. For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner. In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel. In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases. These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing. Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections. We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity. We layout basic properties and discuss major challenges for layerwise-parallel networks. Additionally, we provide a toolbox to design, train, evaluate, and online-interact with layerwise-parallel networks.", "keywords": ["model-parallel", "parallelization", "software platform"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper presents a toolbox for the exploration of layerwise-parallel deep neural networks. The reviewers were consistent in their analysis of this paper: it provided an interesting class of models which warranted further investigation, and that the toolbox would be useful to those who are interested in exploring further. However, there was a lack of convincing examples, and also some concern that Theano (no longer maintained) was the only supported backend. The authors responded to say that they had subsequently incorporated TensorFlow support, they were not able to provide any more examples due to several reasons: \u201ctime, pending IP concerns, open technical details, sufficient presentation quality, page restriction.\u201d I agree with the consensus reached by the reviewers."}, "review": {"SJ1tsSFgf": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkfNU2e0Z", "review": "Quality and clarity\n\nThe paper goes to some length to explain that update order in a neural network matters in the sense that different update orders give different results. While standard CNN like architectures are fine with the layer parallel updating process typically used in standard tools, for recurrent networks and also for networks with connections that skip layers, different update orders may be more natural, but no GPU-accelerated toolboxes exist that support this. The authors provide such a toolbox, statestream, written Theano.\n\nThe paper's structure is reasonably clear, though the text has very poor \"flow\": the english could use a native speaker straightening out the text. For example, a number of times there are phrases like \"previously mentioned\", which is ugly. \n\nMy main issue is with the significance of the work. There are no results in the paper that demonstrate a case where it is useful to apply fully parallel updates. As such, it is hard to see the value of the contribution, also since the toolbox is written in Theano for which support has been discontinued.

The central idea is to include time in the processing of all the units in the network. For this, the authors propose a paradigm switch: form layerwise-sequential networks, where at every time frame the network is evaluated by updating each layer \u2013 from bottom to top \u2013 sequentially; to layerwise-parallel networks, where all the neurons are updated in parallel. The new paradigm implies that the layer update is achieved by using the stored previous state and the corresponding previous state of the previous layer. This has three consequences. First, every layer now use memory, a condition that already applies for RNNs in layerwise-sequential networks. Second, in order to have a consistent output, the information has to flow in the network for a number of time frames equal to the number of layers. In Neuroscience, this concept is known as reaction time. Third, since the network is not synchronized in terms of the information that is processed in a specific time frame, there are discrepancies w.r.t. the layerwise-sequential networks computation: all the techniques used to train deep NNs have to be reconsidered. \n\nOverall, the concept is interesting and timely especially for the rising field of spiking neural networks or for large and distributed architectures. The paper, however, should probably provide more examples and results in terms of architectures that can been implemented with the toolbox in comparison with other toolboxes. The paper presents a single example in which either the accuracy and the training time are not reported. While I understand that the main result of this work is the toolbox itself, more examples and results would improve the clarity and the implications for such paradigm switch. Another concern comes from the choice to use Theano as back-end, since it's known that it is going to be discontinued. Finally I suggest to improve the clarity and description of Figure 2, which is messy and confusing especially if printed in B&W. \n", "title": "A potentially interesting toolbox not supported by enough examples", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "B1KY-MqgG": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkfNU2e0Z", "review": "In this paper, the authors present an open-source toolbox to explore layerwise-parallel deep neural networks.

Considering that responses over reviewers greatly overlapped, we only wrote one comment and put it under the first with a brief note below the other two reviews.\n\nOne major concern across reviewers is the lack of compelling examples. We understand and share this concern. Because, we experienced some difficulties in the past explaining the general idea / concept of layerwise parallel networks, we chose to introduce and compare (on a textual level) the two approaches and their implications in some length. On the basis of reviewer's summaries, we think the core idea is well explained (we will try to improve Fig. 1 in the future). Another goal of the paper is to raise awareness inside the community that there are ways to integrate time into networks which are better suited to bridge the gap between spiking and current deep networks than the ones currently used (e.g. rollout or convolution over time). \n\nWhile we where able to integrate tensorflow support for our toolbox (dependence solely on theano was a concern of two reviewers), we cannot provide meaningful additional examples in the scope of this submission for several reasons: time, pending IP concerns, open technical details, sufficient presentation quality, page restriction.\n\nAgain, we want to thank the reviewers for their effort and fair feedback.\n", "title": "Comment on reviews"}}}
