Then, we resume training the early stopped network using a \"maximal safe set,\" which maintains a collection of almost certainly true-labeled samples at each epoch since the early stop point. Putting them all together, our novel two-phase training method, called Prestopping, realizes noise-free training under any type of label noise for practical use.

The label precision and recall were very high in all datasets. Furthermore, we have added the performance evaluation of selecting clean samples using the small-loss trick (Co-teaching) and the maximal safe set (Prestopping). The selection accuracy of Prestopping was much higher (by up to 18.2pp) than that of Co-teaching (See Section 5.3 for details).\n\nQ2-3.

However, many baselines exploiting the transition matrix (e.g., S-model[1], F-correction[2]) have been reported to perform poorly than Co-teaching [3] we included, and we confirm that Prestopping outperforms more recent baselines according to the accuracy reported in the literature. For example, for CIFAR-10 and 30%-pair noise, the test accuracy of Prestopping was 90.8%, while the test accuracy of ITLM[4] was 88.2%; For CIFAR-10 and 40%-symmetric noise, the test accuracy of Prestopping was 88.7%, while the test accuracy of D2L[5] was 83.4%.

The criterion to construct a maximal safe set is conventional.\nA3-1. We understand your point. The overall framework is similar to self-training or co-training, as you mentioned.

In this sense, we believe that the novelty can be found in how to select clean samples.\n\nSpecifically, for sample selection, Iterative[1] used the local outlier factor algorithm and D2L[2] used the local intrinsic dimensionality. Also, there are many studies used the small-loss trick such as Co-teaching (ICML'18), Co-teaching+ (ICML'19), ITLM (ICML'19), and INCV (ICML'19).

Thank you for your comments. We could not add the two methods[1,2] during the rebuttal period, but we could indirectly compare Prestopping with Iterative[1] and D2L[2] because the two papers have the common setting. Specifically, Prestopping outperforms Co-teaching and Co-teaching+, but Iterative[1] has been reported to perform poorly than them. In addition, according to the test accuracy in the literature, the test accuracy of Prestopping was 88.7% for CIFAR-10 with 40%-symmetric noise, while the test accuracy of D2L[2] was 83.4%.

The training strategy is simple and straightforward. The neural network will first be trained on the entire dataset with all the noisy labels.

Finally, the network will be findtuned on this maximal safe set. The training strategy is very similar to tradictional  self-training in semi-superivsed learning and co-training for domain adaptation ([Co-training for domain adaptation, NIPS 2011]), except that the proposed prestopping only iterate the procedure once.\n\nThe paper discusses two important questions for the method: (1) when to early stop the training; (2) how to constuct a maximal safe set. The authors' responses to these questions are very natual but less interesting. Using the lowest validation error to early stop the training could be suboptimal, since the small validation set can not fully capture the data distribution and could make the network empirically overfit to this validation set.

The significant performance improvement of our method is achieved by a merger of \"early stopping\" and \"learning form the maximal safe set\". \n\nAlso, the second work, one another direction to use \"quick convergence by pre-training\", is really interesting!\nFollowing the paper, the potential of the weakly pre-trained model seems to be great for a wide range of tasks such as adversarial perturbations and label corruption. Thus, it is likely that our method \"Prestopping\" can be further enhanced by taking advantage of a weakly pre-trained model for publicly available data (e.g., ImageNet). \n", "title": "Thanks for your comments."}, "r1g23-JswH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BklSwn4tDH", "comment": "We apology to the readers for the typo in Eq.
