Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.

We are glad that the reviewers agree that machine learning for PDEs is timely and important, and that the results of Fourier neural operators are impressive, leading to many potential applications. We will address the common concerns and then respond to each individual reviewer separately with further details.\n\n1. **Overall impact**: please allow us to restate the impact: Fourier neural operator is the first work that learns the resolution-invariant solution operator for the family of Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent regime. \n    - **Fast**: It is up to three orders of magnitude faster than the conventional pseudo-spectral solver. \n    - **Resolution-invariant**: Our method achieves zero-shot super-resolution, meaning it is trained only on low resolution data ($64 \\times 64 \\times 20$) and evaluated directly in high resolution ($256 \\times 256 \\times 80$). Previous machine-learning based methods are mostly resolution-dependent, requiring the training and testing to be on the same grid.\n    - **Accurate**: Our method still outperforms the baselines by 30% when fixing the resolution in their favor. On the other hand, previous neural operators are resolution-invariant but they did not converge in the challenging case of Navier-Stokes equation. \n2. **Architecture diagram**: We add Figure 2 in the revised paper to explain the full architecture. Given the input function, we first lift it to a higher dimension channel space with an encoder network, apply four Fourier layers, then project it back to the desired dimension of the solution function with a decoder network. \n3. **Expressiveness**: We empirically show that the proposed architecture can approximate complicated operators arising in PDEs that are highly non-linear, with high frequency modes, and slow spectral decay: \n    - **Non-linearity**: The power of the network comes from combining linear integral operators (via the Fourier transform) and non-linear activation functions. As a result, it can learn highly non-linear operators. This is analogous to the standard MLP and CNN where we combine linear multiplications with non-linear activations which allows us to learn highly nonlinear functions. \n    - **High frequency modes**: Although we truncate out the higher frequency modes in the Fourier layer, the operator as a whole can approximate functions with the full frequency range. This is because we represent the function in a high dimensional channel space. When projecting back to the desired dimension, the non-linear decoder network recovers the higher frequency modes.\n    - **Non-periodic boundary**: the Fourier layer can only approximate functions with periodic boundary, but it is not a limitation of the operator as a whole. The linear transform W outside the Fourier transform (the bias term) keeps track of the non-periodic, location information. Therefore, the full architecture can learn solution functions with non-periodic boundaries.\n    - We aim to develop a theoretical analysis for the classes of operators the method can approximate.

Regarding the questions:\n\n1. **Novelty and improvement**: We develop a novel neural operator framework based on Fourier transform, substantially different from the previous graph-based neural operators. Our method has better complexity and efficiency. Fourier neural operator is the first work that learns the resolution-invariant solution operator for the family of Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent regime. Previous graph-based neural operators do not converge on the challenging cases such as Navier-Stokes. \n    - **Complexity**: Our model has quasilinear complexity while the original neural operator is quadratic. In practice, our model is much faster than the previous graph-based models. It is also up to three orders of magnitude faster than the conventional pseudo-spectral solver. \n    - **Accuracy**: We observe Fourier filters are more efficient to represent continuous functions in PDEs. It achieves error rates that are 30% lower on Burgers\u2019 Equation, 60% lower on Darcy Flow, and 30% lower on Navier Stokes.\n    - **Expressivity**: We observe restricting the integration to a convolution does not compromise the expressiveness of neural operators. We empirically show that the proposed architecture can approximate complicated operators arising in PDEs that are highly non-linear, with high frequency modes, and slow spectral decay: \n        1. **Non-linearity**: The power of the network comes from combining linear integral operators (via the Fourier transform) and non-linear activation functions. As a result it can learn highly non-linear operators. This is analogous to the standard MLP and CNN where we combine linear multiplications with non-linear activations which allows us to learn highly nonlinear functions. \n        2. **High frequency modes**: Although we truncate out the higher frequency modes in the Fourier layer, the operator as a whole can approximate functions with the full frequency range. This is because we represent the function in a high dimensional channel space. When projecting back to the desired dimension, the non-linear decoder network recovers the higher frequency modes.\n        3. **Non-periodic boundary**: The Fourier layer can only approximate functions with periodic boundary, but it is not a limitation of the operator as a whole. The linear transform W outside the Fourier transform (the bias term) keeps track of the non-periodic, location information. Therefore, the full architecture can learn solution functions with non-periodic boundaries.\n2. **Clarity**: Thanks for pointing this out. We have added a new diagram in the revised paper to explain the full architecture, and we have updated the paper to make it more self-consistent.\n3. **Reference**: Thanks for the references. We are indeed familiar with these works. In these works, the authors use neural networks to learn prolongation matrices to enhance multigrid solvers. This framework enhances multigrid solvers, but it does not fit into the operator learning setting. Given a new query, one still needs to run the solver and iterate the V-cycle algorithm with the learned prolongation matrix. On the other hand, the neural operator directly learns the solution operators. And given a new query, one can immediately get the evaluation. Although we cannot directly compare with these works, we do have benchmarks with Graph neural network-based operator (GNO) and Multipole graph neural network-based operator (MGNO) which are similar to the frameworks in the reference.

FFT turns it into a $100 \\times 100$ frequency  matrix. If we define $k_{max}=10$, then the lower modes $Z_{k_{max}} = $ { $ (k_1, k_2) \\mid |k_1|<10, |k_2|<10 $} is the four $10 \\times 10$ sub-matrices around the four corners.\n2. **Parametrization of $R$**: In this case, $R$ is a matrix and its entries are the parameter $\\Phi$. We tried other parameterizations to let the entries of R be the output of a linear map or an MLP, as a function of the wavenumber and input function $a(x)$. In these cases, phi is the parameters of the linear map or MLP. In practice, we found the direct parametrization is quite sufficient. \n\nAnd thanks for catching the above!\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer 1"}, "r3ejJ1cd-oJ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HGDtY8le-kE", "comment": "Thank reviewer 2 for the valuable questions:\n1. **Fast computation and discretization-invariance**: We agree with the reviewer that the FFT is restricted to uniform grids, however, as we described in the paper, the general Fourier transform can be deployed for arbitrary meshes. Since, in our method, we truncate frequency modes up to the $k_{max}$\u2019th ($k_{max}<<n$) frequency modes, both FFT and general Fourier transform methods result in fast computation. Therefore, fast computation and discretization-invariance can be both achieved. Please find the detailed expression in the following.\n    - **Complexity**: The complexity of FFT is $O(n \\log n)$ and general Fourier transform is $O(n k_{max})$, where $k_{max}$ is the number of frequency modes. Both are much faster than the full integration ($O(n^2)$ complexity) deployed in the prior works. \n    - **CNN is not mesh-invariant**: Syntax-wise speaking, the CNN can be applied to different resolutions, but when resolution changes the receptive field of the $3 \\times 3$ filters changes. Therefore, each resolution requires specific hyper-parameter tuning. As shown in the experiments reported in Fig. 2, the error rate of Fully convolutional networks (FCN) increases with resolution.\n    - **Fourier filters vs CNN filters**: We observe that the Fourier filter is more efficient in representing the solution of PDEs. The filters in CNN are local: they are good to capture local patterns such as edges and shapes from real-world images. On the other hand, the Fourier filters are global: they are better to capture continuous functions in PDEs.\n    - **Non-discretized data**: In experiments, most of the equations don\u2019t have analytic solutions, so we have to use numerical data. We did zero-shot super-resolution in the experiments. For example, we train on $64 \\times 64 \\times 20$ and test on $256 \\times 256 \\times 80$, which is presented in Figure 1.\n2. **Expressivity**: The power of the network comes from combining linear integral operators (via the Fourier transform) and non-linear activation functions. As a result it can learn highly non-linear operators. This is analogous to the standard MLP and CNN where we combine linear multiplications with non-linear activations which allows us to learn highly non-linear functions. \n3. **Reference**: Thanks for the reference. In the paper \"Enforcing Physical Constraints in CNNs through Differentiable PDE Layer.\" (ICLR 2020 Workshop on PDE), the authors enforce physics constraints within CNNs by projection in the Fourier domain.

Our response:\n\n1. **Data generation**: the data generation is given in the Appendix.\n    - **Distribution**: the input initial conditions are sampled from a Gaussian random field. Then we use conventional solvers to obtain ground-truth solutions. Both the training and testing data follow the same distribution. Investigating distributional shift in initial conditions is very important and we plan to pursue it in the future.\n    - **Resolution**: the lower resolution data is downsampled from the higher resolution. In our empirical study, the training resolution and testing resolution are the same, except for the super-resolution where we train on a lower resolution and test on a higher resolution.\n2. **Training method and loss function**: For NS, the RNN-based methods (Fourier-2d along with other deep learning-based methods), we do the standard training: compute the error for each time-step, and sum them up for later backpropagation. No teacher-forcing. The 3d method (Fourier-3d) directly predicts the full sequence. Other experiments (Darcy & Burgers) are formulated as time-independent problems. For the loss function we use L2 loss.\n3. **Recurring layers**: The Fourier coefficients R varies with the layers in the models we used in the experiments. However, we empirically observe that having the same R for all the layers, results in faster convergence without much drop in the accuracy.\n4. **Expressiveness**: Empirically, we observe the Fourier neural operator is more expressive than the baselines, since we observe it achieves the lowest training as well as testing error. In our empirical study we show that the Fourier neural operator approximates highly non-linear solution operators, with non-periodic boundary, and slow spectral decay. We agree with the reviewer that theoretically analyzing the expressiveness of Fourier neural operators is interesting which in fact is our future direction. \n5. **Periodic boundary condition**: The finite support can cause aliasing, which is alleviated when we truncate the higher frequency modes. But in practice, we do not observe artifacts. Also, we observe the linear transform W outside the Fourier domain helps to capture the non-periodic boundary condition.\n6. **The number of training samples**: For N=1000, we show that the Fourier-2d method outperforms the baselines on all of 1e-3, 1e-4 and 1e-5. For higher Reynolds numbers, the PDEs are more complicated, and hence more data is required for training. Given a sufficient amount of data, we show that the Fourier-3d method outperforms Fourier-2d.\n7. **Future data**: In both NS and Burgers, we learn the map from initial condition to later time steps. In Burgers it maps $t=0 \\mapsto t=1$; In NS, it maps $t \\in [0,10] \\mapsto t \\in [10,T]$. The settings are the same for both training and testing.\n8. **Learning operators**: Yes, we do test our approach using different sample points as in the training data.

Each step of the neural operator then amounts to applying a Fourier transform to a vector (or rather, a set of vectors on a mesh), performing a linear transform (learnt parameters in this model) on the transformed vector, before performing an inverse Fourier transform on the result, recombining it with a linear map of the original vector, and passing the total result through a non-linearity. The Fourier neural operator is by construction (like all neural operators) a map between function spaces, and invariance to discretization follows immediately from the nature of a Fourier transform (just project onto the usual basis). If the underlying domain has a uniform discretization, the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) can be used, allowing for an O(nlogn) evaluation of the aforementioned convolution operator, where n is the number of points in the discretization. Experiments demonstrate that the Fourier neural operator significantly outperforms other neural operators and other deep learning methods on Burgers\u2019 equation, Darcy Flow, and Navier Stokes, and that that it is also significantly faster than traditional PDE solvers.\n\n------------------------------------------\nStrengths and weaknesses:\n\nMuch of the theoretical legwork for this paper, namely, neural operators, was already carried out in previous papers (Li et al.). The remaining theoretical work, namely writing down the Fourier integral operator and analysing the discrete case, was succinctly explained.

These two seem to be in conflict. The authors leveraged FFT for performing fast convolutions differentiably. However FFT assumes the data to be present on a uniform grid (of 2^n grid cells in each dimension). I understand that since the learned content is a frequency \"filter\" that can be applied to any discretization, but this can be said for just about any CNN (in that case a learned 3x3 filter in physical space can also just be projected to the spectral space and work with \"any discretization\"). Furthermore (correct me if I'm wrong), it doesn't seem that the authors experimentally illustrated a case of learning on non-discretized data, and performing inference on discretized versions of it, or vice versa.\n- From Fig. 1, it seems that the actual parameters that are being learned is the convolutional kernel R (represented as spectral coefficients), and W. That basically amounts to a single convolution plus bias operation.
