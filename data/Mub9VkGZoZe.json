Without judging the content as reason, the exposition of the paper is overly difficult to understand. It also makes very specific references to Sorrenson (2020) and Khemakhem (2020) and their proofs without providing context (Section 2). Similarly, it introduces nonlinear ICA without defining the model well (Section 1). This reviewer had to read the mentioned papers side-by-side to make sense of the paper under review. \n\n### Comments about the content\n\nGIN/Nonlinear ICA wants to recover the true generative latent variables $\\mathbf{z}$ for data $\\mathbf{x}$ given the conditioning variable $\\mathbf{u}$, which acts as the cause for the true latent. In particular, it would be important to mention that both data $\\mathbf{x}$ and auxiliary $\\mathbf{u}$ are observed. An example is given in Sorrenson (2020) for (E)MNIST: $\\mathbf{u}$ is the digit to draw, $\\mathbf{z}$ are the parameters that guide the drawing, $\\mathbf{x}$ is the output. The mentioned papers show that the true latent variables can be recovered up to affine transformations, and additional latent variables are noise.\n\nThis paper sets out to examine the question on how to separate informative latent variables from latent variables that encode noise (in the recovered latent) and claims that Sorrenson (2020) chooses the wrong metric for thresholding (they use the std deviation of the different latent variables). This reviewer could not find any particular mentions of this question in Sorrenson (2020), except for implicit usage in the experiment section.\n\nHowever, this paper claims that mutual information is a better metric and Sorrenson (2020) made a mistake in their proof. This reviewer did not retrace the proofs. Moreover, this reviewer could not understand how eq. (5) in this paper, which uses the data processing quality with the joint of the latent, motivates using the mutual information of the individual latent variables to identify informative ones. \n\nMoreover, intuitively, the MI with the auxiliary variable will tell us about the dependence of the two, which will identify latent variables that encode local information for the conditioning variable (eg digit) and which change a lot in their distribution depending on the conditioning variable (using the language from Sorrenson (2020)).\n\nThis leads to the question about \u201cglobal\u201d parameters, which do not change in distribution. For example, if MNIST was not grayscale but had digits with different colors (equally likely), the color could be a global parameter, which would be uncorrelated with the conditioning variable and thus have zero mutual information. This would mean that this paper would treat it as a noise variable, which it is not.\n\nAs such, this reviewer would ask the authors for clarification.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n1. The figures lack axis labels.\n2. FGSM is a rather weak adversarial attack.\n3. Section 5 and Figure 9 mentions that the learnt representation $\\mathbf{w}$ is very close to a permutation of the real latent variables. This is explained in Sorrenson (2020), Section 3.2: \u201cwhen both the generating and estimated latent spaces follow a Gaussian distribution, the latent space variables are recovered up to a trivial translation and scaling.\u201d This is the case here: there is no rotation, which leads to a permutation in the correlation matrix.\n\n---\nThis reviewer wants to thank the authors for their detailed reply and for updating the paper to make it more self-contained. It reads much better now and is much clearer. The review score has consequently been updated from 4 to 6. Stronger adversarial experiments would be encouraged. Could the authors also include a definition of the VAR criterion (even though it is trivial, just to avoid any ambiguities) and maybe include a paragraph for the future applications of this? For this reviewer, it is not entirely clear yet what the value of this finding is: is it going to help with downstream tasks for ICA? Is this another argument in favour of preferring Mutual Information as a metric over variances in general?", "title": "Reservations arise about the exposition and content of the paper", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "odthAeSvw_": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Mub9VkGZoZe", "review": "This paper considers the problem of disentangled representation learning with an existing normalizing-flow-based approach, called general incompressible-flow networks (GIN). In the original approach, informative latent variables were separated from noise by considering the variances of learned latent variables and selecting ones with high variances. The current paper shows empirically that this approach can fail even when the underlying data generating process satisfies all assumptions needed for identifiability. The reasoning is simple: Latent variables can have different scales and their variances may not be indicative of informativeness. Instead, the current paper proposes to use the Shannon mutual information between the auxiliary observed variable (conditioned on which the true underlying factors of variation are conditionally independent and belong to the exponential family) and latent variables to separate informative latent variables from noise.

While previous work relied on the variance of the variables to assess informativeness, the authors argue that this is problematic when the scale of noise epsilon is large. They propose instead to use the mutual information between the variables and u instead.\n\nThe authors evaluate their alternative identification method on two tasks: a toy example of a mixture of gaussians and EMNIST. They show that when the variance of epsilon is large, then their method outperforms the variance based method (figure 3). However when the variance of epsilon is small, then VAR performs similarly to MI (Figure 8).\n\nOn EMNIST, it's clear that MI is able to identify the most important variables and outperforms the best VAR setting, however when more variables are included the MI method deteriorates quicker than VAR. \n\n## Review\n\nIn general I find the paper difficult to follow. Many paragraphs have an unclear structure and sentences are not linked. There are also many unsubstantiated, or unclear/imprecise claims. The derivations and equations seem correct and the figures are well made and understandable. Especially figures 1 and 2 are informative and clear.\n\nI think the paper would be a lot stronger if it was positioned as \"This is a failure case of using the VAR method with GIN, we propose a rigorous solution\". Currently the authors make statements such as \"Though Sorrenson et al. successfully establish the identifiability, their interpretation on the meaning of this result and the method they propose are incorrect\", \"it is unplausible to use the variances of the learned representation\" and \"while the original VAR criterion is not competent at all\" - despite clearly showing that the VAR method works well in a number of situations. I think it's worth being more nuanced about alternative methods and explicitly showing when the other method does not behave as described/expected (which you also do!).\n\nCould the authors comment on how the MI was computed and in particular the computational trade offs between using MI and VAR to select variables? I'm also curious why the MI method degrades so quickly in figure 6, how did you set up the classification task?\n\nHow did you \"apply defence\" in the adversarial defence experiment? You mention that VAR300 is only fooled by 56% of the cases without defence, but this cannot be compared because its \"clean accuracy\" is lower, could you expand on that? It seems to me that higher accuracy is always better? It seems in contradiction with the claim at the end of the paragraph that \"all results indicate that ... features selected by MI criterion are more reliable.\"\n\nIn general, a lot of the experiments seemed to be based on Sorrenson et al, but are not properly described in the paper. I would like to see at least a basic description.\n\nIn summary, I think the authors have identified an interesting improved that is worth publishing. However I think that the paper in its current form is not ready: it can benefit from significant rewriting for clarity (both in structure, as well as spelling) and further analysis of the behaviour in figure 6.\n\n## Notes:\n\n\"Incompressive\" --> incompressible  \n\"in nonlinear independent analysis theory\" - missing \"component\"?  \nW_{d+1:n} should be W_{n+1:d} (below equation 4)?  \n\"unplausible\" -> \"Implausible\"?  \n\"interpretation on\" -> \"interpretation of\"\n\nThere's a number of other, non-existent, words in the paper that will be caught by a spellcheck.\n\n## After updating paper\n\nAfter reading the updates, I think the authors have considerably improved their paper and I have increased my score.\n\nWhile the core contribution, using MI over VAR, is clear. The evaluation is not strong enough, I still don't understand why adversarial defense is a reasonable way to evaluate the different metrics. Further it's now clear that the author's use the sklearn implementation of MI estimation, which depends on several entropy estimators which have high variance in practice. While the authors comment that it's \"negligible\" I am not convinced that this is actually easy or reliable.\n\nIn summary I think the paper is not ready for publication.\n", "title": "Review", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "ozUJArn6rU": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Mub9VkGZoZe", "comment": "The authors appreciate the constructive comments from all reviewers and we would like to summarise the revision of our paper here.\n\n- Axis labels in the figures are added.\n- Appendix A with more detailed nonlinear ICA review is added to make the paper more self-contained.\n- Section 2 is restructured to make the MI algorithm and its motivation more clear.\n- More details about how we conduct classification are added in Section 3\n- More discussion on the classification accuracy decay and Section 4", "title": "Revision summary"}, "g7pCG00q4rm": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "DiCRXvfcoFd", "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for very constructive comments.\nWe hope to first partially address the reviewer's concerns and open more discussions, while working on a writing improved manuscript.\n\n#### **1.

Reply to 'In figure 6, ...'**\nSince in practice, one only need to select a certain truncation level and use it for classification, the quicker deterioration of larger truncation levels (possibly by including noise dimensions) for MI does not hurt its performance for classification purpose.\nMoreover, the non-informative estimated latents in $\\mathbf{w}$ should not be used for classification in principle and our experimental results also validate this point.\n\nNevertheless, we are interested in this phenomenon and would like to share some of our thoughts on it.\nAs there is no ground truth informative latent of EMNIST and the theoretical requirements of Nonlinear ICA are not satisfied by the dataset, we couldn't directly justify if the variables are or even can be estimated well. \nFor the low dimension manifold assumption for EMNIST, we tend to accept it as there are also other works arguing the similar point, e.g., Facco et al.\nAnd we also think it may be possible that current individual MI evaluation algorithm is not perfect.\n\nAmong many possible reasons to the quicker deterioration phenomenon, the one presented in our current submission is from the perspective of using density models for classification.\nWe can see that when MI and VAR include the same all entries, they achieve the same and worst performance.\nWe conjecture that the most problematic entries may have intermediate level of mutual information but low level variance.\nAs a result, they are included into $S$ much earlier by MI than by VAR and cause sharp drop of performance in Figure 6 for MI.\nAssume $w_{150}$ is one of the entries causing sharp drop.\nWe think it might be possible that $p(w_{150}|u_i)$'s, $i\\in I$, have lots of overlaps to each other. \nAs a result, a point in $u_i$'s cluster might have a higher density value in on $p(w_{150}|u_j)$ and this mismatch contributes a lot to the calculation to $p_S(u|\\mathbf{x})$.\n\n#### **3.

Reply to '... set up .. classification...'**\nThe density based classification mechanism is the same for both synthetic and EMNIST data.\nAs explained in Section 3, a sample $\\mathbf{x}$ is classified into the category $u$ which can maximise the posterior probability $p_S(u|\\mathbf{x})$.\nAnd the set of informative latent $S$ is selected respectively by VAR and MI.\nLet's say MI thinks in $\\mathbf{w}=[w_1, w_2]$, $w_1$ is the informative variable, then $S=\\{w_1\\}$ and $p_S(u|\\mathbf{x})$ is evaluated by $\\{p(w_1|u_i), p(u_i)\\}_{i\\in I}$.\n\nIn practice, one only need to select a truncation level and use it for classification.\nAs a result, the quicker deterioration of larger truncation levels (possibly by including noise dimensions) for MI does not hurt its top performance for classification purpose.\nMoreover, as the low mutual information entries are very likely encoding no additional information to the previous ones and mainly encode noise, we should not include them for classification in principle.\nWe think the most problematic entries have intermediate level mutual information (which do not encode new information and should not be included) and low level variance.\nAnd MI include them earlier than VAR, which leads to the sharp and early performance drop.\nWhen they include the same and all entries, they perform the same and worst.\n\n#### **4. Reply to 'how... apply defence'**\nSimilar to the idea of using density models for classification, we design adversarial defence by identifying samples with low density on all categories as adversarial samples, as explained in Section 4.\nFollowing the above example, for a sample $\\mathbf{x}$ with estimated latent $\\mathbf{w}=[w_1, w_2]$, if $p(w_1|u_i)$ for any $i\\in I$ is lower than certain thresholds, MI will refuse to classify it and achieve the defence.\nAnd we use the density value of the points one standard deviation away from the mean as thresholds as mentioned in Section 4.\n\nOur point in the adversarial attack experiments is to show that MI30 can admit a better adversarial defence mechanism than VAR300 with the density models they build by selecting different sets of estimated latents as informative latents.\nAs a result, we state that we cannot prefer VAR300 simply because the error rate without defence is lower when $\\eta=0.02$.\nThe clean accuracy ($\\eta=0$) of MI30 is higher than that of VAR300 is due to that MI admits a better density model.\nSince the decision boundary is defined by a density model, the sensitivity to adversarial attack is also defined by the density model.\nAlthough we do not have a rigorous answer, we conjecture MI30 degenerates more when $\\eta=0.02$ is related to the decision boundary.\nWe infer that MI30 decision boundary separates the latents with a narrower margin which admits higher clean accuracy and higher adversarial sensitivity.\nMoreover, thanks to the better density model, we could identify the adversarial samples and refuse to classify them.", "title": "Thanks for the comments"}, "DiCRXvfcoFd": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Mub9VkGZoZe", "review": "This paper considers the previously established Generative Incompressible Flow (GIN) model to perform disentangled representation learning and argues that the original method of identifying explanatory latent variables via their variance magnitude is flawed.

This paper proposes the mutual information between a latent variable and an auxiliary variable (needed because otherwise, the disentanglement objective is unsolvable in general) as an identification criterion and shows that this outperforms the variance criterion, especially in cases where the noise magnitudes are of the same order as the magnitudes of the explanatory variables.\n\nI think this paper makes solid arguments for why the original variance criterion is flawed under certain conditions and why the mutual information criterion is better and I lean towards accepting.\n\nHere are a couple of comments, weak points, and questions:\n- Labeled axes would make the plots more readable without having to re-read the caption multiple times\n- At some point, you claim that the importance of any latent variable can be dependent on which auxiliary variable is used.
