The core idea is to efficiently estimate the metrics of interest for a model-under-test using Bayesian neural network. We develop a methodology to efficiently train the Bayesian neural network from the limited number of labelled data. We also devise an entropy-based sampling strategy to sample the data point such that the proposed framework can give accurate estimations for the metrics of interest.

Comparision with the method in [Sawade 2010]?\n\nA comparison with Sawade 2010 is not possible as this work only provides tractable formulas for two specific risk functions (l_{0/1} norm for classification problems and l_2 norm for regression problems) \u2013 See Derivations 1 & 2 in Section 3.1 of Sawade 2010. For classification problems, the l_{0/1} norm corresponds to the accuracy metric \u2013 See Eqs. (1) & (2) in Section 2 of Sawade 2010. This means that for classification problems, the method in Sawade 2010 can only be used to sample data so as to estimate the accuracy metric. In contrast, our proposed method can estimate any metrics (e.g. accuracy, per-class metric, macro-precision, macro-recall).\n\n2. There seem to be a number of misconceptions about prior work?\n\nThe work in Sawade 2010 did derive a general formula to actively sample data points for any risk function that maps the predicted target and the true target to a real-valued number (Theorem 1 in Section 3.1), however, it is unclear if this formula is tractable for every function. To be specific, this general formula depends on the unknown ground truth of the data in the test dataset, the unknown metric estimation, and on the unknown true conditional p(Y|X). In Sawade 2010, the paper only suggests two tractable derivations of this general formula when the risk function is l_{0/1} norm and l_2 norm (Derivations 1 & 2 in Section 3.1). For classification problems, the risk function l_{0/1} norm corresponds to the case when the metric needs to be estimated is the accuracy metric. This is the reason why we argued in our paper that previous approaches are specific to some particular evaluation metrics. We have revised our paper to make this point clearer \u2013 See the 2nd paragraph in the Introduction Section.\n\n3. The use of mutual information to prioritize which observations to label?\n\nIn deep Bayesian active learning (AL), mutual information is one of the most common criteria used to select the data point to label [Gal et al, 2017]. Specifically, the data point that maximises the mutual information can be (heuristically) considered as the data point with the highest prediction uncertainty [Gal et al, 2017]. Selecting this data point will maximally improve the prediction accuracy of the trained model in the AL problem. In our work, we construct the acquisition function (Eq. 5) by deriving a new random variable that represents the metric estimation and combining with the mutual information criterion. The data point that maximises this acquisition function can be (heuristically) considered as the data point that causes the highest uncertainty in the metric estimation. By labelling this data point, we maximally reduce the uncertainty in the metric estimation, and thus, maximally improve the accuracy of the metric estimation. \n\nThe same logic can be applied in the case of multiple metrics. That is, we aim to select the data point that maximises the sum of mutual information so as to maximally improve the accuracy of all the metric estimations. We have revised our paper to clarify this point clearer.\n\n4.  What is average relative error?\n\nThe average relative error is the average relative error of the metric estimations. Assume we need to estimate K metrics with the true values being m_1, \u2026, m_K, and if we denote the estimated metrics are \\hat{m}_1, \u2026, \\hat{m}_K, then the average relative error is computed as 1/K (|\\hat{m}_1 - m_1| / m_1 + \u2026 + (|\\hat{m}_K - m_K| / m_K). This error is large in certain cases as in some cases the true metric value is relatively small, and thus, it makes the average relative error to be large. We use the average relative error to compare between methods because for a metric set, the metric values are in different ranges, and thus, relative error needs to be used.\n\n5. Characterize the theoretical guarantees of the estimates?\n\nTheoretically, when the number of data points in the test dataset is finite, we have shown that the estimation obtained by our method is unbiased (Remark 3.3). When the number of data points in the test dataset is infinite, we currently don\u2019t have the theoretical analysis. It\u2019s worth noting that for deep Bayesian AL, deriving the asymptotically theoretical analysis is a very challenging task and most of the current work on deep Bayesian AL do not have the asymptotically theoretical analysis. In our future work, we will continue to explore this analysis.\n\nEmpirically, we can see that the average relative error converges to 0 when the number of labelled data increases to infinity (Figures 1 & 2). From the formula of the average relative error, it can be directly inferred that when the average relative error converges to 0, the absolute error of each metric estimation also converges to 0. \n", "title": "Answers to AnonReviewer 4"}, "7XDdzW4Qyf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "qGsttwY1clE", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback.  We address the reviewer's questions below, and we are happy to continue discussing any of these points or answer follow-up questions.\n\n1. What is the variation in the sequences of points chosen for labelling depending on the metric that is being calculated?\n\nThe variation in the sequences of points chosen for labelling is caused by the variation in the initial labelled set D^0_l. In each experiment, we initialize with a different labelled set D^0_l (randomly selected from the whole test dataset), and thus, the sequences of points selected for labelling are different in each experiment. This variation is the variation in the average relative errors in Figures 2 & 3.\n\n2. Calculating the ROC curve does not require classifier internal structure. It only requires some continuous output representing class membership rather than just a discrete indication.\n\nWe agree with this point. We have corrected this in the revised version of the paper.\n\n3. Remark 3.2: Simplicity seems an insufficient reason to have the binary classifier and Bayesian Neural Network have the same structure. This should be explored and at least a summary of performances given for variations on this.\n\nAs both the binary classifier and the BNN have the same type of inputs, thus, a simple choice is to use the same architecture for these two models. Note that, even when the two models share the same architecture, their hyper-parameters (e.g. number of training epochs, drop-out rate, learning rate) are very different. In particular, we employed Bayesian optimization to tune the hyper-parameters for each model given the labelled data \u2013 See Sections C.1 and C.2 for more details. Should time and computing resources permit, we will make our best efforts to obtain a summary of the performances when the binary classifier architecture varies.\n\n4. To sample the point that is best for multiple metrics, equation (9) is used, which calculates the sum of the mutual information between the BNN parameters and the metrics. Is it obvious that using the sum is the best way? I wonder if using something different like the point that most increases the minimum mutual information may work better.\n\nAs the reviewer points out, when we have the mutual information corresponding to each metric, combining them using the sum is perhaps the easiest, and most practical way. This is also our motivation when constructing the acquisition function for a set of metrics by summing the mutual information. As shown in our experiments, this idea works well in all scenarios. And thank you for the suggestion of selecting the data point that most increases the minimum mutual information, we will try this idea in our future work.\n\n5. In algorithm 1, step 6, note that C\u03b7t\u22121 is being trained on Dlt\u22121.\n6. In algorithm 1, step 8, Slt\u22121 is undefined. Do you mean to refer to Sl from step 7?\n\nYes, in step 6, C_\u03b7^{t\u22121} is being trained on D_l^{t\u22121}. And in step 8, we meant to refer to S_l from step 7. There is a typo in step 7, it should be S_l^{t-1} (not S_l). We have fixed these two points in the revised version of the paper.\n\n7. In figure 1, the average metrics seem to vary quite significantly with the number of oracle queries. Since you are measuring the average, I expected the decrease to be relatively smooth. How do you account for the significant variation?\n\nIn deep Bayesian active learning, since the BNN is retrained in each iteration, it is common that there is variation in the prediction accuracy (see the performance of BALD in Figures 1 & 2). In our proposed method, besides the BNN, we also trained a binary classifier for the augmented data step, thus, the variation is larger compared to BALD.\n\n8.

The evaluation does not support the claim that ALT-MAS performs substantially better than traditional evaluation or prior works.\n\nWe\u2019d like to emphasize that our proposed method ALT-MAS only performs worse than other baselines (either Traditional or BALD) in several cases; and in these cases, ALT-MAS only slightly performs worse (please refer to the y-axis value of each plot) - Please refer to our answer in Question 3 for how to define better method. Besides, as discussed in the paper, one of the key advantages of ALT-MAS is that it is the most consistent method. It performs consistently well in all cases while other methods do not perform consistently well in all cases, i.e. the average relative errors of ALT-MAS are always within a reasonable range whilst other methods can perform very badly in some cases. In particular,\n+ The method \u2018Traditional\u2019 performs very badly when the models-under-test are bad models (the 2nd row of Figures 1 & 2). The average relative error of \u2018Traditional\u2019 is extremely large in few cases (can go up to 1e7 %).

In contrast, the average relative error of ALT-MAS is always within a reasonable range in all cases.\n\n2.\tThe title suggests that the paper addresses machine learning in general. However, only a simple deep neural network for MNIST and CIFAR10 is used in the evaluation.\n\nWe\u2019d like to clarify that we evaluated the methods using 6 different models-under-test (3 models-under-test for each dataset) \u2013 See Sections C.1 and C.2 in the Appendix for descriptions of these models-under-test.

For example, there are methods that perform well (smaller errors) at the beginning when the number of labelled data is small, but do not perform well when the number of labelled data is larger or goes to infinity. For data-efficient methods, it is common to evaluate the performance of the methods asymptotically, i.e. to analyse the performance of the methods when the number of labelled data increases to infinity. This evaluation criterion has been commonly used in many areas such as active learning, Bayesian optimization. This is the reason why we stated: \u201cBetter methods are those that converge faster to zero\u201d.\n\n4.\tActive testing is appealing when it can be assumed that the test data has a different distribution than the training data. However, most of the experiments use same train/test distribution.\n\nWe\u2019d like to emphasize that in the experiments, we did evaluate the scenario when the test data has a different distribution compared to the training data. Specifically, for each dataset, we evaluate all the methods with a model-under-test that were trained on a completely different dataset (with 5 different sets of metrics) \u2013 See Sections 4.1, 4.2 in the main paper and Sections C.1 and C.2 in the Appendix. This evaluation is already 1/3 of all our experiments. \nIt is also worth noting that the purpose of our framework is to assess the performance any machine learning model-under-test, not just model-under-test when training data distribution is different with test data distribution. Thus, as discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we evaluate the proposed framework using different types of models-under-test: good model (training dataset is same as testing dataset and perfect training process), average model (training dataset is same as testing dataset and average training process), bad model (training dataset is different with testing dataset).", "title": "Answers to AnonReviewer 1 - Part 1"}, "PQQmKTlAWKe": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "pRGF3Jtaie", "comment": "We thank all the reviewers for their thoughtful comments.

Specifically, we proposed to train a binary classifier that aims to predict the data points in the test dataset for which the model-under-test agrees with the ground-truth.

The approach learns a sampling function that decides which observations need to be labeled, which are then fed to a Bayesian neural network (BNN) that aims to estimate the distribution Y|X. The authors select which observations to sample by maximizing the mutual information between the model evaluation metric and the BNN parameters.\n\nPros:\n+ Active testing of models is a difficult problem in high-dimensions. The proposed problem is highly relevant.\n\nMajor concerns:\n\n1. The authors have primarily focused on comparing against a traditional sampling method that simply takes IID samples and a deep-learning-based active learning algorithm for learning the distribution of Y|X. Both of these comparators are very weak. The former is not doing any active learning. The latter is trying to do a much harder task of learning Y|X rather than estimating the evaluation metrics. I think a more reasonable comparison method is the active testing approach from Sawade 2010 that estimates the distribution p(Y|X;\\theta) using a neural network.\n\n2. There seem to be a number of misconceptions about prior work. The authors argue that previous approaches are specific to particular evaluation metrics and cannot scale to high-dimensional data. However, the active risk estimation approach taken in Sawade 2010 is quite general and can be used to estimate the expected value of any function l that maps the predicted target and the true target to a real-valued number, which is the same type of functions considered in this paper. It is also easy to extend the approach to multi-variate evaluation metrics by, say, replacing the squared error with the squared L2 norm. Finally, you can use any estimator of Y|X in their framework, so one could use a neural network to do active risk estimation for high-dimensional data.\n\n3. The authors do not give a justification for why they used mutual information to prioritize which observations to label. Is there a way to show that it minimizes the estimation error of the evaluation metrics? And similarly, why should one try to prioritize which observations to label using the sum of mutual informations?\n\n4. I am confused by the y-axes in Figures 1 and 2. What is average relative error? The average relative error is very large in certain cases. In this case, do all the methods have unacceptably large errors?\n\n5. When estimating evaluation metrics for classifiers, it is important to characterize the theoretical guarantees of the estimates. Do we know if the method is consistent or (asymptotically) unbiased? Are there confidence intervals associated with this approach?
