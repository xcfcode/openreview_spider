Below we address your specific comments:\n\n\u201cHowever, the proposed solution of just integrating an additional detection task branch within the Siamese tracking architecture is naive. The main idea of integrating instance driven detection as an auxiliary task is borrowed from [1]\u201d\n\nJust to clarify, we do not claim that this is the first work to propose conditioning a full-frame detector on an exemplar image (as in [1], which we cite in our work). Our claim is that this is the first work to incorporate it in a tracking-specific architecture, trained end-to-end alongside a traditional center-crop Siamese tracking network. We would also like to highlight that the addition of the detector branch is simply to improve and regularize the latent representations used by the Siamese tracker. In this sense, the motivation for instance conditioned image detection is very different to those of [1] (which propose doing so to improve detector performance).\n\n\u201cSome recent works, such as [2, 3] have also investigated a similar problem of richer object representations for deep visual tracking. These approaches are desired to be discussed and empirically compared in order to fully validate the strength of the proposed approach.\u201d\n\n\nThank you for the additional related work. We will cite these papers in the next version of the manuscript.

We address your concerns below:\n\n\"- Makes claims about Siamese trackers in general but only experiments with authors\u2019 architecture\u201d.\n\nSiamRPN++ was open sourced only recently and therefore we could not run analysis directly on their architecture. We will do so for follow-up revision of the paper. Our architecture is similar to theirs, and initial experiments using SiamRPN++ suggests that the conclusions will transfer. The main difference between the two architectures is that we do not use multiple scales/aspect ratios anchors to generate our bounding box proposals as we found that it did not help performance. Indeed, we tried to reproduce their results exactly but could not get the stated results on OTB or VOT. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the hypothesis needs to be tested across other Siamese trackers as well. \n\n\"- Analyses in Figs. 6\u20138 not very helpful/conclusive\u201d\n\nPerhaps the results in Figs. 6-8 should be stated more clearly in the text. The aim of those figures was to show that the performance gained by adding the detector is attributed to learning more robust target representations. The aim of Figs. 6-7 is to show that the response to spatial perturbations between the models trained with and without the detector are virtually the same. Figure 8 shows a small, but stable improvement in the IoU when more abstract (temporally older) targets are fed into the network. \n\n\u201c- No test case where capturing appearance is important for tracking and authors\u2019 approach helps\u201d\n\nThanks for the helpful suggestion. We will attempt to perform such analysis for the final manuscript if accepted. \n\n\u201c- No comparison of tracker trained without detection objective on real vs. random targets\u201d\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that such a model would be a useful baseline. A model trained end-to-end with random targets would learn to track as well as possible without making use of the target. Nevertheless, some of our experiments show that even models trained with standard target schemes learn to rely on the target in an \u201cadaptive\u201d fashion. Specifically, Figure 7 shows the IoU performance increases when the target is moved completely outside the receptive field of the network. \n\nThank you for the edit suggestions listed under \u201cminor comments\u201d.

Indeed the strategy learned by the network of when to rely on the template and when to rely on saliency can be quite complicated as depicted by the experiment in Figure 7. \n\n1 - The performance of a given tracker is not only dependent on the network output but also on post-processing. Namely the proposals generated by the network are selected according to hand-crafted heuristics. The representations learned by Siamese trackers are typically independent of the way the proposals are selected (certainly the case for SiamRPN++).The focus of this work is on analyzing the representations learned by the Siamese networks in these trackers. We will make this point clearer in the text. Our tracker results in only 7 more failures than SiamRPN++ (57 vs 50) on a total of 21356 frames. We believe this result to be sufficiently close to SoTA for our results to be considered relevant.\n\n2 - Perhaps we should have made this clearer in the paper, but the purpose of Figures 6 & 7 is precisely to show that the detection task has little to no effect on reducing spatial bias. Where it does have an effect is on promoting more abstract learned target representations (e.g. temporally stale targets) as depicted in Figure 8. A small gain in average IoU can lead to a considerable gain in robustness (Figure 5). Please note that the legend was swapped in the original version of the paper, see our comment on OpenReview. \n\n3 - We agree with the reviewer that additional analysis may provide further insights. Nevertheless, please note that the results illustrating the effect of the detector robustness (e.g. Figure 5) is already more statistically significant than what is typically reported in tracking literature. This is particularly important on datasets without standard train/validation splits such as VOT.  Specifically, we show robustness with error bars throughout training and not merely a final robustness value. What type of additional analysis would the reviewer suggest? In subsequent versions of the paper, we will also include additional perturbation analysis results for the open source version of the SiamRPN++ tracker in the final manuscript (early experimental results show SiamRPN++ has similar characteristics to our tracker - which is unsurprising given that the architectures of both trackers are both Siamese Correlation-based networks). We will also include a similar analysis on for a curated set of discrete events (e.g. saliency bias for frames labeled to contain occlusion).", "title": "Response to Reviewer #3"}, "S1lT_rjdtr": {"type": "review", "replyto": "BygfiAEtwS", "review": "This paper investigates representations learned by Siamese trackers.

However, its execution unfortunately leaves a lot of room for improvement and getting it into acceptable shape would require a major revision.

However, the authors do not analyze any other trackers than their own one.

The only real effect the detector shows in Figs. 6\u20138 is a tiny improvement in IoU in Fig. 8 \u2013 otherwise the analyses neither support the claim nor do they reveal why detection as an additional objective actually helps. To establish that there is a center bias and trackers ignore the appearance term, the following two analyses could be done:\n\n- Identify a set of test cases where capturing appearance is important (e.g. temporary occlusion) and demonstrate that your approach improves performance on these cases.\n\n- For the table in Fig. 5, also show how a conventional tracker (i.e without object detection branch) performs on random targets. If the hypothesis is correct that the object detection objective during training reduces center bias and increases reliance on appearance, then a conventional tracker should show a smaller reduction due to random targets than your improved tracker does. The same quantitative analysis could also be done for existing state-of-the-art trackers, as it does not require training. \n \nMinor Comments:\n- Caption of Fig. 4: is instead of if?\n- Figure 5\n\t- y-axis label: lower is better despite \u201crobustness\u201d suggesting the opposite\n- Why do the numbers in the figure not match those in the table?\n- What is the center bias baseline, i.e. what is the performance if center of search image is predicted without any network?\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 2}, "rJe0cj3z9B": {"type": "review", "replyto": "BygfiAEtwS", "review": "\n= Summary\nThis paper proposes to learn a visual tracking network for an object detection loss as well as the ordinary tracking objective for enhancing the reliability of the tracking network. The main motivation is that, current state-of-the-art models based on the Siamese architecture often blindly predict the center of a search window as target location due to the bias in datasets and training strategies. This issue is alleviated in this paper by introducing an auxiliary task, target detection in the entire image space. The auxiliary task is conducted by another branch on top of the visual feature shared with the tracking branch. By learning to detect object in the entire image space, the shared feature extractor will be trained to capture discriminative and unique appearance features of target.\n\n\n= Decision\nAlthough the main motivation is convincing and the manuscript is well written, I would recommend to reject this submission mainly due to its limited contribution and weakness in experimental analysis. \n\n(1) In the experiments, the practical benefit of adding the auxiliary detection task is demonstrated, but the final scores of the proposed model are clearly below those of current state of the art in terms of both reliability and accuracy. Further, it is not explained why the proposed model is worse than the other models in performance and what can be claimed as an advantage of the proposed method even in this situation. Also, I do not understand why the proposed model is not based on the current state of the art like SiamRPN++ but is built upon a manually designed/low-performance model. \n\n(2) The experiments in Section 5 do not demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model at all. In Figure 6 and 7, the difference between the proposed model and its reduced version without the auxiliary task looks quite subtle, and it is hard to say which one is better than the others. In Figure 8, adding the auxiliary detection task results in even worse tracking performance. \n\n(3) More qualitatively and quantitatively analysis should be done on the other tracking benchmarks and be compared with other tracking models recently proposed too.", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "1: Reject", "confidence": 3}, "rJg5RTRVuS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BygfiAEtwS", "comment": "We noticed that the legend in Figure 8 is swapped.
