With this formulation the non-convex game formulation of GANs can be transformed into a infinite dimensional problem analog to a finite dimensional bilinear problem.  \n\nI really like this approach, that tries to find methods that converge globally to (mixed) Nash equilibriums. However I have some concerns. \n\n- I'm concerned about the definition of a $O(T^{-1})-NE$. Actually, this merit function is not standard for game. It can be 0 even if $x_t,y_t$ is far from the equilibrium (for instance for the problem $\\min_{x \\in \\Delta_d}\\max_{y \\in \\Delta_d} x^\\top y$ with $x_t = (1,0,\\ldots,0)$ and $y_t= (F(x_{NE},y_{NE}),1-F(x_{NE},y_{NE}),0,\\ldots,0)$ we have $F(x_t,y_t) = F(x_{NE},y_{NE})$ but $x_{NE} = y_{NE} =(1/d,\\ldots,1/d)$). One merit function that could be considered is $\\max_{y} F(x,y_t) - \\min_{y} F(x_t,y)$. \n\n- There is a gap between the theory and the practical method that could be bridged. Actually Theorem 2 assume that the stochastic derivatives are unbiased but since your Langevin dynamics gives you an *approximate* of the next distribution an analysis taking into account this bias would provide much stronger results. More precisely, it would be interesting to have a result similar as Theorem 2 with conditions on $\\epsilon_t$ and $K_t$. For instance, if the theoretical $K_t$ is too large it would reduce the interest of your algorithm. I think this analysis is key since it allows to claim that you can properly approximate the distributions of interest.\n\nIf you are able to ease these concerns I'm eager to increase my grade.\n\n\n- \"(5) is exactly the infinite-dimensional analogue of (1):\" Actually it is not exactly the analogue since $<.,.>$ is not a scalar product anymore (particularly, $<g,\\mu>$ is not defined) but the canonical pairing between a space and its dual (we are loosing something going to infinite dimension).\nI think it should be clarified somewhere. \n\nMinor comments: \n- on the updates rules of $\\theta$ and $\\omega$ (Page 6) the Gaussian noises are missing. \n- On algorithm 3,4,5 and 6 the Gaussian noise is too wide and causes an Overfull.\n\n=== After Authors response ===\nThe authors fixed some major issues.

I hope you can see why the reviewers (misleadingly) thought you were making a big deal of this part. \u201c\n\nWe respectfully disagree with your comment. We explicitly state four contributions in the introduction. Based on the rebuttal, hopefully we can convince the reviewers to evaluate the other three as well. \n\nIn particular for ICLR, a new perspective and the end-to-end engineering are important. Our contributions in proposing novel problem formulations and also taking care of the non-trivial implementation should not be underestimated, given it outperforms methods which search only pure strategy equilibria.\n\n\u201cI perfectly understand the dilemma here\u2026\u201d\n\n\nWe had already minimized Section 3: It is only one-page long. It is accessible to the general audience while the appendix supplements the precise derivations. \n\nWe would be happy if the reviewer can provide further suggestions about improving presentation as you did in the initial comments. However, we also contend that the reviewer\u2019s arguments so far have not entirely justified the low score.\n\nThank you very much for pointing out the glitch with Frechet derivative; we note that entropy is NOT Gateau differentiable but it possesses Frechet derivatives at all the directions in the definition of our function class; see Appendix A.\n\n\u201cI should add that I totally agree that there is definitely value in formally stating and proving the convergence of infinite-dimensional MD (as I stated in the original review). It is just perhaps the wrong venue. (Don't you want a qualified reviewer to properly check your appendix? ICLR reviewers, due to the load, are not obliged to do so, as you must be fully aware.)\u201d\n\nIn our opinion, the technical level in this paper does not meet the level of a premier theory venue. However, there is clear practical value in our work thanks to the theoretical guidance. Philosophically, we also do not think that it is reviewers\u2019 job to examine the proof in its entirety; it is our job to ensure the correctness of the paper.\n\nAt the same time, experienced reviewers can always grasp high-level messages and judge accordingly.  To be more fair, we sincerely ask you to concentrate less on the inf-dim MD part (which is only about one page in the main text) and re-evaluate the our contributions based on the revised full paper and also our discussion for ICLR. \n\n\u201cTotally. You can change the definition of GAN... \u201c\n\n\nThe term \u201cGAN\u201d for us is a general concept representing the training paradigm where an auxiliary adversarial party is added. We understand that there is not a universal agreement so we have removed the sentence in the revision. \n\n\u201cLastly, another issue that the authors might have overlooked: the formulation of GAN (such as minimizing f-divergence or the Wasserstein distance) is actually well-defined and admits a unique solution. The difficulty only comes in when we use a nonconvex neural network to do certain approximations (as the authors pointed out in the response).\u201d\n\nThe formulation of GAN is well-defined on the level of probability measures and functions but NOT on the level when we parametrize them with neural networks. Our framework IS well-defined even when neural networks are involved. We have never overlooked this; in fact, we see this as the major advantage for solving mixed Nash Equilibrium: it is always well-defined no matter what parametric models you use, and this is simply wrong for the pure strategy equilibrium.\n\n\u201cNow we have defined a mixed-equilibrium formulation (which is well-defined even with a nonconvex neural network approximation), but due to infinite-dimension we have to do some computational approximation. Does this sound familiar? How do we know if the approximate MD would behave benignly?\u201d\n\nWe again disagree with the reviewer. We justify the approximation by examining them with numerical evidence. We conducted experiments in the paper, and the main routine (sampling) was also reported successful in the many previous studies that we cited. We also stress again that, assuming SGD/Adam/etc. gives you the solution of the minimization problem, there is currently nothing we can say about optimizing GANs.\n\nIf the reviewer rejects our paper based on the argument that the computational approximation is not a good option, then this would imply that all the papers that motivate from convex optimization perspective and then heuristically deploy them to neural nets have low research value. Such a track is nonetheless the mainstream of state-of-the-art understanding of training GANs (see also the concurrent submission cited in our previous rebuttal), and has lead to many valuable insights. In our opinion, making valid assumptions should be valued, instead of dismissed.\n", "title": "Thank you for the constructive response"}, "Skl0WT3Op7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJew8qeCn7", "comment": "We have addressed all of your concerns and we look forward to further correspondence with you.\n\n\u201c The technical challenge is to write those algorithms in infinite dimensional spaces.

Since [1] assumes a CONCAVE reward, ordinary finite-dimensional mirror descent already solves the PURE strategy equilibrium. \n\nIn particular, there is no notion of mixed Nash Equilibrium (mixed NE) in [1], and all the optimization variables are in subsets of R^d, and hence, it is completely different from our setting. When applied to training GANs, one necessarily faces the problem of non-concavity, and no result in [1] can hold. This problem was studied by (Grnarova et al. 2018) in our submission, which we have cited and compared to in detail. \n\nWe also stress that we have already cited the most relevant literature (Balandat et al., 2016) on convex games in Banach spaces, and the relevance in other related works (such as the ones provided by Reviewer3) are contained in (Balandat et al., 2016). \n\nSpecifically, our framework is algorithmic, and we study convergence of a specific, implementable, algorithm, which has the same theme as (Balandat et al., 2016). \n\nOn the other hand, the second and third paper provided by Reviewer3 concern existence of mirror maps and do not provide any algorithm.

It is also not a fair evaluation. \n\nSimply put, prior to our work, the literature treats the GAN formulations as if they are (semi) convex-concave games. Then, you see familiar optimization methods from the deep, earlier literature in game theory and online learning applied to the GAN problem, basically ignoring the non-convexity of neural nets (except for the very few literature that we cited). \n\nOur work proposes a new insight, which is obvious in retrospect for theorists: We seek distributions over GAN parameters and show that the underlying learning problem is a well-posed, bi-affine convex game, albeit infinite dimensional. \n\nWe build on this insight by showing how the infinite-dimensional entropic MD applies to it with rates while the iterations of this algorithm can be obtained via Langevin dynamics. We also take care of the end-to-end engineering aspects of this proposal and integrate an algorithm that has excellent practical performance. \n\nThere is no such work in the literature, which encouraged us to state that we resolved an open problem. \n\nWe contend that none of the elements of our approach has theory dressing or obfuscation. We do not use an existing algorithm that has guarantees with a different set of assumptions and yet still apply to GANs. All the elements in our approach are necessary. If you take any one of them out, whether it is the infinite dimensional bi-affine game reformulation via Riesz representation, or Langevin dynamics-based iterations, the framework falls down. \n\nWe also know that people technically skilled can do the infinite-dimensional MD extensions, but since there is nothing to cite currently, we put the derivation for completeness. \n\nIn fact, Marc Teboulle mentioned to us in private communication in October 2018 that he had the infinite-dimensional characterization of the entropic MD done but did not publish. We are also personally aware that Arkadi Nemirovskii is more than capable of doing such a derivation, along with many other optimization experts.  \n\nThat being said, however, we would appreciate if the reviewers can point out to us any literature that has the derivation written down and how it connects with Langevin dynamics for sampling. The reason for this terse remark is that if we do not provide the derivation, it is a point for criticism. If we do it for completeness, as in the current paper, it should not be a reason for omitting our real contributions and over-emphasizing as if it is the main contribution of this work in an overly harsh manner. \n\nFinally, we stress that our theory allows to make the strongest theoretical claim for training GANs to date: Assuming the success of sampling from a single neural net, which was empirically justified in previous work, we can show non-asymptotic convergence rates to the saddle points. In contrast, even if we assume that SGD/Adam/etc. globally optimize a single neural net, can we say anything about the convergence to the saddle points of classical GANs?

Quite strangely, the authors made a fundamental mistake at the very beginning: their definition of approximate mixed equilibrium  (page 2, Notation) is bizarre and different from those in previous work (such as Nemirovski's MP paper). Fortunately, this is perhaps only an oversight on the definition; the algorithms and theorems are for the correct definition anyways. Example: consider min_{-1<= x <= 1} max_{-1<=y<=1} xy. Should we call (x, 0) an (approximate) NE for any x??\n\nAnother major issue with this work is its relaxation into mixed NE. The \"bilinarization\" trick in Eq (5) goes back to Kantorovich (who perhaps deserves to be mentioned), and is a relaxation in general: we now have to use a mixture of generators.
