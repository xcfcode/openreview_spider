Thank you for your effort in those regards. Unfortunately, there are still major issues with the readability of the paper from a language usage standpoint as well as a conceptual standpoint. I will address the conceptual points that jumped out to me while reading this revision.\"\n\nThanks for your detail comments.\n \n\"1) There seems to be some confusion on your part regarding the nature of synapses and how they behave. You are correct that there are channels in the synapse that allow different ions to flow across them. The voltage difference across the cell membrane causes influx and efflux of ions. These ions flow through channels that are able to filter out specific ions based on the size of the ion and the folding abilities of the proteins that make up the ion channel. You are also correct that the opening and closing of specific channels is stochastic.\" \nOK, we agree on these observations of biological synapses.\n\n\"However, the population activity of these channels is not entirely stochastic at the synapse level. These channels are not themselves inhibitory or excitatory but rather the entire synapse is either excitatory or inhibitory.\" \n\nOur hyperthesis is that the opening of some channels will enhance the activation of the neuron and the opening of some channels will inhibit the activation of the neuron. They are two classes: maybe called alpha-channel and beta-channel. (To avoid confusion, it may not call them excitatory channel and inhibitory channel). Here we just need to distinguish the contribution of channel's openness. \n\nThe excitatory or inhibitory of  a synapse is decided by the synapse function. The excitatory and inhibitory are relative terms. The more alpha-channel opened the more contribution of a synapse to active the neuron; however, the more beta-channel opened the less contribution of a synapse to active the neuron. \n\n\"Furthermore, you go on to say that it is known in neuroscience that most synapses are inhibitory. I do not believe that this is an accurate statement for the brain as a whole, or for even most sub areas of the brain. To be honest, I'm not sure anyone as yet answered this question as it is very complicated to do this measuring and mapping.\"\n\nThis was an observation that many inhibitory synapses played more during activity. We are not sure whether this is right or not. But in our digital topological link of the network, we found that inhibitory item may connect more. For example, we may have one excitatory item x and all others are inhibitory y. It could be that all excitatory items can be packed into one item.  \n\n\"2) It seems that one of the things that could have greatly enhanced the quality of your paper, i.e. experiments on data more difficult than MNIST, was not included even though a benchmark against a standard MLP was shown. \"\n\nThat is our work in progress. We have constructed a new block to replace LSTM block in RNN. But have not found a right benchmark by using RNN. The CNN is the next project. The hard part is to figure out its tensor representation.\n\nMNIST is for proof-of-concept. We think this experiment has proved our model worked in practice. \n\n\"3) The definition of a synapse seems very trivial and there is no discussion as to where it comes from. You cite an unpublished paper as the source, but that is all. Since the current manuscript fundamentally relies on it, it creates a problem if it isn't well described.\"\n\nIt comes from our abstract biological model and probability computing we have discussed in the paper. It is the joint probability of two events: the opening probability of excitatory channels and the opening probability of inhibitory channels.  \n\nThe synapse function is not trivial. Its dynamics can be very complicated. Let's see S=4*x*(1-x). It is the case of y=x. It is the logistic function with chaotic dynamics. Iteration x <- 4*x*(1-x) in computer can watch chaos effects.\nIn our paper, we have shown the complicated structure from this simple and basic function.\nWe have discovered that S = x(1-y) is the addition of an Identity function and a topological conjugate function in surprisal space.

It has n inputs and n outputs with n*n synapses.\n\nYou raised a very interesting question. We defined a synapse with two inputs and one output. Ignored the parameters it is x(1-y). It is hard to figure out how it connects to a neuron in this probability space. After convert to surprisal space, it is -(log(x)+log(1-y) or I(x)+G(y). For multiple synapses contacted to one neuron, it is I(x)+Sum(G_i(y_i)). That follows Dale's law. Since I(x) is the Identity function, G(y) is the topologically conjugated function, we may think a synapse is to do a topologically conjugated transform in surprisal space. \n\nIn our wild conjecture, the synapse may change its \"shape\" to complete its function.

I find it hard to believe that all of your ideas have no precursor.\n\nWe are going to explain some of our methods. For example, dual space analysis is a widely applied method. In our case, it is probability space and surprisal space. It is hard to study the non-linear function in the probability space,\nbut our function becomes linear in surprisal space. Many results can be easily concluded from surprisal space. Entropy, surprisal, surprisal function have been well known and defined.

We have no intention to ignore the latest remark work in neuroscience. Most synaptic models are built on the differential equations of electronic property. Our biological model is very simple but we believe that it works in the right direction. The opening property of ion channels with different types is the key in our analysis. Fortunately, there are two types of channels in a synapse: excitatory and inhibitory channels. The randomness of the channels is the basis for us to apply probability theory.

In reverse, we know more brain from model studying.\n\nThe motivation of this work is based on the research and analysis of the biological neural system.  First, synapse plays an important role in learning and memory. In neuroscience, it is synaptic plasticity. The excitation and inhibition are observed in the synapse network. In advanced, the random opening of ion channels is also observed. Second, synapses can connect to other synapses to form a synapse network. Third, synapse makes a non-linear transform. \n\nSynapse in the artificial neural network is supposed as a simple linear amplifier, it is the multiplication of a parameter and an input variable.  There are no synapses connecting to synapses. But one thing is the same, the learning and memory are related to synapses, the change of synaptic parameters. Current artificial neural network ignored the existence of synapses but simply consider them as weights. All the focus are on neurons. \n\nBack to our motivation. Why synapse act as a transform?  Why is it non-linear? What is the distribution of the synaptic matrix? The same question for an artificial neural network is what is the distribution of its weight matrix? Make sense?\n\nOK. We found a reasonable synapse function. The reasons were explained in the paper.  The function is not a simulation of a synapse but an abstraction of the probability. It is a non-linear function with parameters.  From their connection, we can form a synapse network. \n\nWhat is our \"interesting intellectual exercise\" bring in our paper? \n\n1. Probability Space and Surprisal Space\n\nLogarithmic space has been studied in artificial neural network for a long history. But fruitless in ANN. Because the data field of ANN is the real number field from negative to positive. The surprisal has been defined in information theory and natural language processing and it is related to a random variable. Direct select variable from probability space,  the surprisal is the negative log function. Moreover, we found that it is useful to define the surprisal space. Two difference between logarithmic space and surprisal space: 1) different in a negative sign 2) real space vs (0,1) space.\nsurprisal represents a self-information bit. The non-linear product in probability space is the linear addition in surprisal space. There may have a lot of new things need to be studied in the surprisal space.

Just because biological neurons use synapses does not mean we should try hard to put a certain instance of them into deep neural networks. Clearly this is not an attempt to add to neuroscience, as beyond the inspiration of neurons having synapses, there is little attempt to biologically plausible. As an attempt to add to machine learning research, the neuroscience motivation is unconvincing.

In some cases, alpha can be bigger than 1.0 and make sense. But beta looks always less than 1.0. Yes. we are going to limit beta less than or equal to 1.0.

We first defined a basic formula and gave an explanation of the formula that was based on an abstraction of the biological neural network. Then we gave the definition of the model, related concepts, and theorems with proofs. In this way, we explored and concluded many features of the model, the target was to figure out the learning rules be applied with backpropagation.  Finally, we showed an experiment to prove the concept. \n\nAuthors' contributions: (A lot of)\n\n1. The neural network model is the authors' creation. \n \nThe biologically-inspired synapse equation S(x,y; a,b)=ax(1-by) is defined by the product of the opening probability of excitatory channels of a synapse and the opening probability of inhibitory channels of a synapse. Unlike the synapse in spike neural network, we consider the ion channels as the basis to build our synapse model. We ignored the spike feature of the biological neural network because it is the feature of neurons not synapses. The flow of ions and the random opening of the channels are the foundation of our synapse analysis. From a probability perspective, we abstract the synapse equation.  In contrast to classical neural network with weights, its synapse is simply a product of the input variable and the weight. Our synapse is a non-linear unit. The practical biological synapse is much complex, But we present a simple model that can be analyzed in math. \n\n2. We defined the surprisal space to connect Information Theory with our model.\n\nAlthough entropy is widely used in machine learning but surprisal is the more fundamental concept. When we apply surprisal on synapse equation, we have a linear combination in log space which has been used in machine learning analysis. With a negative in front of the log function, we can convert data to the surprisal space. In surprisal space, we can explain the negative log probability as the bits of self-information. That does make sense of surprisal space. It can be a new representation of the neural network. If somebody finds papers to applying surprisal space to explain neural network please let us know, we are going to list them as our references. \n\nBy defining surprisal space, we build the mapping between a probability space and the surprisal space. It is a real positive space in our definition. The bits addition is the basic operation of a neural network. \n\n3. Synapse with topological conjugacy is our discovery\n\nIt is very exciting to find that the surprisal of the inhibitory probability is a topological conjugation in our model. That means the dynamical behavior in probability space can be bijected into surprisal space and both have the same dynamics. \n\nIn advance, we discovered that this topological conjugation is a commutative diagram in category theory. That opened the door to apply new mathematic tools to study neural network. The discovery between the connection of the neural network and category theory is unexpected. That is one of our exciting contributions.   \n\n4. We discovered gradient updating in synapse learning followed Bose-Einstein distribution\n\nThis is a direct conclusion from synapse equation in surprisal space without any statistical hypothesis.  That solved the famous black box problem in our model. So we can expect some kind of BE distribution in the parametric matrix. It is a new representation of a neural network.\n\n5. We constructed a fully-connected synaptic neural network as synapse tensor\n\nWe successfully convert fully-connected non-linear synapse network into a matrix (tensor) computing. This synapse tensor is a special connection of synapses. Other network topologies are possible. Synapse tensor can be basic blocks to construct a large-scale neural network. \n\n6. We discovered that synaptic neural network has a similar block to ResNet block in surprisal space\n\nThat is why we mentioned ResNet.  Except we apply surprisal non-linear function but still computing identity mapping.   \nSo we expect some features of ResNet such as protect gradient from vanishing in the very deep synaptic neural network.\n\n7. We proved the gradient rule with loss function that mapped in surprisal space\n\nThat is proof that we can apply the backpropagation algorithm on the fully-connected synaptic neural network.  The proof is in very details because we want to verify that the new gradient computing is correct. \n\nIn conclusion, our synaptic neural network is compatible with backpropagation, however, spike neural network is not. \n \n ", "title": "About the Clarity of this Paper"}, "Byl3YpOCn7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJgS3s0I3Q", "comment": "\"the paper to me seems a hashing of citations to the main works in neuroscience and deep learning\"\n\nPlease show us what main works in neuroscience and deep learning we have been hashing?\n \n\n ", "title": "It is better to list evidences in details."}}}
