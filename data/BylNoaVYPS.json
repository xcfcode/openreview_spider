In this work, we are interested in controlling one agent in a multi-agent system and successfully learn to interact with the other agents that have fixed policies. Modeling the behavior of other agents (opponents) is essential in understanding the interactions of the agents in the system. By taking advantage of recent advances in unsupervised learning, we propose modeling opponents using variational autoencoders. Additionally, many existing methods in the literature assume that the opponent models have access to opponent's observations and actions during both training and execution. To eliminate this assumption, we propose a modification that attempts to identify the underlying opponent model, using only local information of our agent, such as its observations, actions, and rewards. The experiments indicate that our opponent modeling methods achieve equal or greater episodic returns in reinforcement learning tasks against another modeling method.", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "multi-agent systems", "representation learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The present work addresses the problem of opponent modeling in multi-agent learning settings, and propose an approach based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs).

Interestingly, as the authors show, it looks like it is possible to compute accurate embeddings of the opponent policies without having access to opponent observations and actions. The paper is well written, the methods are simple yet still interesting/informative, but there are a few questions that I find necessary to be addressed.\n\n\nMethods:\n\n1. I find the idea of learning to infer embeddings of the opponent policies from the agent's own local observations quite interesting. Intuitively, it makes sense -- since the opponent's policy effectively specifies the dynamics of the environment (from the agent's perspective), opponent's behavior must be reflected in the agent's observations. Comparing figures 1 and 2, the proposed encoder architecture also uses information about the reward (and episode termination). How critical is this information for opponent identification? Would it work without r_{t-1} and d_{t-1}?\n \n2. Sec. 4.2: \"We assume a number of K provided episode trajectories for each pretrained opponent\" -- how exactly are these trajectories obtained? Similarly, how exactly are the opponents pretrained? (Self-play, hardcoded, or something else?)\n\n3. As the authors mention, the triplet loss that discriminates between the opponents loosens the lower bound. Since the regularized objective is still a lower bound, I wonder if the triplet loss can be re-interpreted/expresses as a specific prior on the opponent model?\n\n\nExperiments:\n\n1. Sec. 5.1: to understand the effect of opponent modeling, it would be nice to see how baselines perform in this setup against a randomly picked opponent (otherwise, the curve in Fig. 3-c is not informative). I suggest the following baselines: tit-for-tat (hardcoded), a couple of classical learning algorithms for iterated games (e.g., policy hill-climbing, WoLF), an agent that learns using policy gradients but without opponent embeddings. Without any baselines, Sec. 5.1 seems like a sanity check which just shows that the implementation works unless I am missing something.\n\n2. Sec. 5.3: (1) Why is mutual information between the approximate posterior q and the prior p makes sense as the policy embedding quality metric here? (2) Could you intuitively (or formally) justify the fact that the triplet loss degrades MI metric? Right now, this is stated as a fact but not justified. (3) It looks like Grover et al. (2018a) used deterministic trajectory encoders; how exactly is MI measured in that case?\n\n3. If I understand correctly from Fig. 4, SMA2C (which uses local information) underperforms as compared to the methods that use opponent trajectories in 6/8 cases. To me, this somewhat confirms the point opposite to what the authors claim -- local observations, while containing some information about the opponent, are still inferior. Also, having baselines that do not use opponent embeddings on the charts of Fig.4 would help understand the contribution of opponent modeling.\n\n----\n\nI acknowledge reading the author's response, which addressed some of my questions/concerns to some extent. However, I believe that while estimating accurate embeddings of the opponent behavior from the agent's observations only is interesting, the approach has limitations, and I feel those are not studied in-depth enough (e.g., as a reader, I would like to understand if and when I should use the proposed approach and expect it to work). My assessment of the paper stays the same.", "title": "Official Blind Review #2", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 3}, "BkxEohEDjB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJlAsasptH", "comment": "Thank you for your review. As noted in the paper, the novelty of our work is to enable effective opponent modelling based only on local observations of our controlled agent. This is in contrast to all of the other literature on opponent modelling we are aware of, which generally assumes access to observations of opponents (e.g. their actions and/or observed states). See, for example, this recent comprehensive survey on opponent modelling methods [1]. Our work shows that VAEs can be used to achieve effective opponent modelling using only local observations, achieving comparable results to alternative methods that assume access to observations and/or actions of opponents.\n\nWe emphasise that the common assumption of having access to opponent actions/observations is unrealistic for many applications, and our work is a first step in removing this assumption.\n\n[1] Albrecht SV, Stone P.

We are delighted that you found the method interesting. Below, we try to address your comments about the methods and the experiments.\n\nMethods:\n1) Note that we provided an ablation study in Appendix B of the paper. We have moved the ablation study from the Appendix to the main text and added plots for more environments.\nIn most environments, the model performs similar without using r_{t-1} and d_{t-1} for weak generalization. For strong generalization, the performance in speaker-listener and double speaker-listener decreases. \n\n\n2) The trajectories of the opponents are gathered against agents which were trained using MADDPG. Details can be found in Appendix D.\n\nIn the speaker-listener environment, we control the listener, and we create ten different speakers using different communication messages for different colors (hardcoded). In the double speaker-listener, which consists of two agents that have to be both listener and speaker simultaneously, we control the first agent. We create a diverse set of opponents that have different communication messages similar to speaker-listener (hardcoded), while they learn to navigate using the MADDPG algorithm (training), with different initial random seeds. In the predator-prey environment, we control the prey and pretrain the three other agents in the environment using MADDPG with different initial parameters (training). Similarly, in spread, we control one of the agents, while the opponents are pretrained using MADDPG (training). Note that these details are included in Section 5.2 of the paper.\n\n\n3) While we do not yet have a mathematically sound argument to support this, we tend to agree with your opinion. Intuitively, we believe that the triplet loss could probably be interpreted as a discrete prior, such as a Bernoulli prior on the latent variables. This could be an interesting investigation in subsequent work.\n\nExperiments:\n1) Our intention, in this case, was indeed to show that our method can achieve effective opponent modelling with only local observations. In this case, we assume that there are two opponents with fixed policies. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have added one of the requested baselines (A2C, a policy gradient method) in the new Figure 3-c. The other training-based baselines have exactly the same behavior as A2C. Note that in this experiment, we assume that the training agents have access only to local observations and not the actions of the opponents.\n\n2) (1) We use mutual information as a means to evaluate the learned representation. We practically compute the MI between the embedding distribution q(z|x) and the prior on the labels which is uniform, not the prior on the latent variables which an isotropic Gaussian. This is a common way to evaluate representations in the literature of representation learning. Practically, high MI could be interpreted as a high statistical dependence between the embeddings and the opponents' identities. For example, the example of Figure 3-b has high MI which is close to the upper bound. By counting the MI, we want to measure whether the encoder learns any relationship between the agent labels and the embeddings. One of the most powerful solutions that we could provide to the problem described in section 4.1, which however uses strong assumptions, is to concatenate the observation of our agent along with a one-hot vector that represents the identity of each opponent.\n(2) We discovered a small mistake in our experiments. The value of MI in table 1 was incorrect. We have updated the paper accordingly. The triplet loss forces the linear separability between the embeddings of different opponents, which practically increases the MI. We thank the reviewer for pointing us to this error.\n(3) Note that we estimate the MI from samples and not analytically from the distributions. Even though the representations, that Grover et al use, are deterministic there is some underlying distribution and the embeddings could be considered as samples from this distribution.\n\n3) We emphasise that our goal is not to outperform methods that use opponent information; instead, our goal is to enable opponent modelling when only local information is available. It should be expected that one can perform better if opponent information is used.\n", "title": "Reply to AnonReviewer 2."}, "SJxB69VDsS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rkgGaeaAFH", "comment": "We would like to thank you for your review and your comments.
