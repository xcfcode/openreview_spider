The model is applicable to classification problems with undirected graphs, intractable for standard classification CRFs. The model representation of GCRFBC is extended by latent variables which yield some appealing properties. Thanks to the GCRF latent structure, the model becomes tractable, efficient, and open to improvements previously applied to GCRF regression. Two different forms of the algorithm are presented: GCRFBCb (GCRGBC - Bayesian) and GCRFBCnb (GCRFBC - non-Bayesian). The extended method of local variational approximation of sigmoid function is used for solving empirical Bayes in GCRFBCb variant, whereas MAP value of latent variables is the basis for learning and inference in the GCRFBCnb variant. The inference in GCRFBCb is solved by Newton-Cotes formulas for one-dimensional integration. Both models are evaluated on synthetic data and real-world data. It was shown that both models achieve better prediction performance than relevant baselines. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed models are discussed.", "keywords": ["Structured classification", "Gaussian conditional random fields", "Empirical Bayes", "Local variational approximation", "discriminative graph-based model"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "Main content:\n\nBlind review #2 summarizes it well:\n\nThe authors provide a method to modify GRFs to be used for classification.

Applying a bernoulli distribution seems trivial. \n\nApplying the Bernoulli distribution on the outputs of the GCRF might seem trivial in the case of GCRFBnb model since the mode of GCRF over latent variables is used in learning and inference, which makes this case straightforward.  However, as it is well known, probabilistic model which does not consider full distributions but only the mode of the distribution loses important information and often does not perform well. Therefore, we introduced latent dependence structure and marginalized the joint distribution of P(Y,Z) over latent variables, which is not an easy task. In order to lower the computation cost we marginalized the distribution using local variation approximation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that local variation approximation was used in the case of several dependent Bernoulli variables.  Additionally because of the model representation we derived the inference procedure which is straightforward and have low computational cost.\n\nPoint 2. When the GCRFBCb model would be better than the GCRFBCnb. \n\nIn the appendix D we presented in table 5 and figure 2 detailed results obtained on synthetic dataset that can explain where the GCRFBCb model is performing better than the GCRFBCnb. We emphasized in section Experimental evaluation - synthetic dataset, in which cases GCRFBCb performs better than GCRFBCnb.  Comparison of GCRFBCb and GCRFBCnb performances are presented in figure 2.\nIt can be noticed that in cases where variances of latent variables are relatively small, both models have equal performance considering AUC and conditional log likelihood.  This means that results obtained by unstructured predictors are equally or more important for classification task compared to the structure between outputs. In such case, MAP estimate is a satisfactory approximation.\nHowever, when data were generated from a distribution with significantly higher values of $\\beta$ compared to $\\alpha$, the GCRFBCb performs significantly better than GCRFBCnb. This means that the structure between outputs has significant contribution to classification task compared to the results obtained by unstructured predictors. It can be concluded that GCRFBCb has at least equal prediction performance as GCRFBCnb. and that the models were generally able to utilize most of the information (from both features and the structure between outputs).\n\nPoint 3. The learning procedure is untracktable and hard to follow.\n\nIndeed, learning procedure of GCRFBCb is more complex than the one of GCRFBCnb. That is due to the marginalization over latent variables which allows the model to exploit more information than the one relying only on the modes of latent variable distributions in case that the variance of these distributions is large (as discussed in Point 2).  It is also true that the procedure is computationally more demanding, but we wouldn\u2019t qualify it as intractable, since we managed to perform training in reasonable time. Also, learning procedures of structured models are usually computationally more demanding and so is ours. But the computational and conceptual complexity of the procedure paid off in better prediction results as our experimental evaluation shows.\n\nPoint 4. The multilabel datasets  don't seem to be good datasets for structured predictions.\n\nWe noticed that in many papers that are focused on structured predictions the multilabel problems were given. The multilabel problems can be defined as structured prediction problems, because structure between labels can have significant impact on classification scores. However, in response to your request we added two additional datasets that are completely structured. Both dataset are connected with the highway congestion prediction on two different highways in Europe. Now we demonstrate consistent improvement on 3 completely structured datasets.\n\n\nPoint 5. There should be more thorough fine-tuning of other models.\n\nWhen we considered your suggestion, we noticed that we indeed didn't properly train CRFs, so we rerun the experiments and indeed they now perform better than logistic regression models, but our approach still outperforms them. The pairwise potential that we used in CRF are implemented in pystruct module of CRF (https://pystruct.github.io/user_guide.html).\n\nPoint 6. It would be good to have a discussion on when this model would do worse than the others.\n\nRegarding potential drawbacks of our model, it relies on the assumption that the underlying distribution of latent variables is multivariate normal distribution, so in the case when this distribution cannot be fitted well to the data (e.g. when the distribution of latent variables is multimodal), the model won't perform as well as it is expected. In response to your suggestion, now we emphasize this in the paper. But also, compared to classical CRFs and SSVM our model has three important advantages, as it is emphasized in the Introduction.", "title": "Response to Official Blind Review #1"}, "HkxMCAOqjH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B1lu-0I2Fr", "comment": "Point 1.

Please note that the repository does not contain any information on the authors nor their institutions. The link was provided solely for purposes of better evaluation of our work by the reviewers.\n\nPoint 2. Can the authors intuit why random forests and neural nets don't perform as well ? \n\nThere are two reasons why random forests and neural nets cannot outperform classification accuracy of GCRFBC models.\n1. The random forests and neural networks are unstructured classifiers, meaning that they model outputs as conditionally independent given inputs, so they do not consider structure between output variables which contains valuable information. In structured (Ski lift congestion dataset and Highway congestion dataset) and multilabel (Gene functional dataset and Music according to emotion dataset) classification tasks information shared among outputs have significant impact on classification accuracy, so unstructured classifiers are outperformed.\n2. GCRF for classification can also be seen as an ensemble model, which takes the outputs of unstructured classifiers as inputs. Therefore, GCRF for classification is able to figure out how reliable unstructured classifiers are and how much predefined output structure is significant for modeling and that way boost classification accuracy compared to unstructured models.\n\nPoint 3. It seems there are many knobs one can tune to get better performance, so I will take the presented results with a grain of salt. \n\nIn this revision we payed attention to fine-tune hyperparameters of all classifiers. The results in the paper are updated, but there is no important difference.\n\n\nPoint 4. Also, it seems one can also use other \"link\" functions with MRFs (similar to link functions in generalized linear models) to not just do logistic but other possible losses as well. How about multiclass classification using softmax ?\n \nYou are absolutely right. Due to the conditional independence of elements of output vector (yj) given corresponding latent variable (zj) it is possible to use different loss functions. In the case of non Bayesian GCRFBC (GCRFBCnb) the learning procedure and inference is straightforward in multiclass case, too. However, in our experience, marginalization of joint distribution for multiclass classification problem is not easily defined relying on local variational approximation. Therefore, other variational approaches (e.g. variational autoencoders with reparametrization trick) would be preferred, but they require more computational power compared to procedure that is implemented in this paper. However, we intend to explore that approach in our future work.\n", "title": "Response to Official Blind Review #2 "}, "r1gpwXPsYB": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ryxC-kBYDS", "review": "The work involves modifiying gaussian conditional random fields to work for classification problems instead of regression problems. The main idea is to apply a bernoulli distribution on top of the regression values to convert them to work with binary classification problems. Two variations are discussed along with the inference and learning methodology. The inference can be done using numerical approximation and learning using variational methods and is still untracktable. Comparisons with other modeling strategies is done using experiments.\n\nThe paper is incremental and doesn't really provide improvements to learning parameters (or at least there is no theory showing this in the paper). The experiments do not seem satisfactory as discussed below.\na) Applying a bernoulli distribution on the output of the GCRF seems trivial. It is not very clear when the GCRFBCb model would be better than the GCRFBCnb. The learning procedure is untracktable and hard to follow on why this might provide better results.\nb) The datasets (music classification and gene classification) don't seem to be good datasets for structured predictions i.e. the interaction needed between the nodes is not clear. Since they are multilabel problems, one could have just modeled the system with N independent nodes or design a multinomial distribution instead of only for binary classification.\nc) There should be more thorough fine-tuning of other models, for e.g. in the ski lifts experiment, the CRF does much worse than logistic regression in the results. This is most likely because the parameters were not initialized properly using normal tricks like using logistic regression. Typically for truly structured problems, CRFs do better than their logistic regression counter parts. It is also not clear how the other models (CRF and SSVM) pairwise potentials were modeled.\n\nIt would really help to make this paper stronger by showing the new modeling technique does better than CRFs (that are tuned properly) on better structured datasets.
