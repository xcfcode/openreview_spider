We call this \u201cDeep Deducing\u201d. In short, after adequately training a deep neural network according to a strategy-environment-to-payoff table, then we initialize randomized strategy\ninput and propagate the error between the actual output and the desired output back to the initially-randomized strategy input in the \u201cinput layer\u201d of the trained deep neural network gradually to perform a task similar to \u201chuman deduction\u201d. And we view the final strategy input in the \u201cinput layer\u201d as the fittest strategy for a neural network when confronting the observed environment input from the world outside.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Deep Feed-forward Neural Network", "Recurrent Neural Network", "Game Theory", "Control Theory", "Nash Equilibrium", "Optimization"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper presents \"deep deducing\", which means learning the state-action value function of 2 player games from a payoff table, and using the value function by maximizing over the (actionable) inputs at test time.\n\nThe paper lacks clarity overall.

The idea is to perform gradient optimization of the payoff w.r.t. the strategy. Preliminary results on tic-tac-toe and variations of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma task are presented. The paper has an interesting idea at the core. However, it is poorly written, does not properly discuss the related works and does not present a convincing method or experimental results. \n\nPros:\n* The paper considers an interesting question of exploring the applications of neural networks to the game theory problems.\n* The idea of the paper is reasonable. It makes sense to me to perform gradient-based search over the strategies (assuming that the payoff is differentiable).\n\nCons:\n* Writing\n- The paper is over the mandatory length limit of 10 pages.\n- The paper makes a grandiose claim: \u201cthis paper provides a revolutionary way for reinforcement learning and a possible road toward general A.I.\u201d However, there are arguably no revolutionary ideas, and certainly no reinforcement learning experiments!\n- Despite the claim, the novelty of the paper is limited. There is no discussion of the related work: optimization of the neural networks w.r.t. the inputs [1]; related RL ideas such as model-based learning [2,3] and Monte-Carlo Tree Search [4].\n- The problem being solved is never formally stated. As far as I understand, Nash equilibrium is usually defined (1) in mixed strategies, while the paper seems to consider pure strategies; (2) in the scenario where every player attempts to maximize their payoff, while in the paper the players attempt to achieve some pre-fixed value of the payoff.\n- The flow of the paper is generally poor. Instead of presenting a general solution and then showcasing its applications, the paper iterates on similar ideas multiple times. For example, all four algorithms are just gradient-based optimization of either the weights or the inputs to a model.\n- The paper provides extremely misleading analogies and explanations. I am quite sure that a mosquito brain is not a one hidden layer fully-connected neural network! Also, the example of avoiding a moving hand is poor: since the outcome is life or death, the learning should happen via evolution, not during the lifetime of a single insect. The claim that the neural networks with sigmoid activation functions are less prone to local optima is questionable as well.\n\n* Method and experiments\n- The proposed method is essentially a greedy gradient-based planning procedure. For this to work, we need to have a very good environment model. This is a strong assumption that is not discussed.\n- The experiments are performed on very simple synthetic problems: matrix games and tic-tac-toe. They do not suggest that the method is general and can work on harder problems, say, Sokoban [2].\n- The experiments do not present any baselines, so it is unclear how well the method performs compared to the alternatives. One obvious candidate is gradient-free optimization, such as Nelder-Mead, and gradient descent with momentum, which can be less prone to local optima.\n\n[1] Brandon Amos, Lei Xu, J.

The originality of the paper is to show that experimentally, in some 2-player games (and small sequential games, using an RNN), the policy that is inferred is close to a Nash equilibrium. While this is an interesting result in itself, the games used in the experiment are pretty easy to solve with existing algorithms, so the experimental evidence that this approach can work in practice in difficult cases is weak.\n\nThe motivation and intuition fail to be convincing.
