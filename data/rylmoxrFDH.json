We derive new surrogates using a novel derivation based on writing the stochastic neural network as a Markov chain. This derivation also encompasses existing variants of the surrogates presented in the literature. Following this, we theoretically study the surrogates at initialisation. We derive, using mean field theory, a set of scalar equations describing how input signals propagate through the randomly initialised networks. The equations reveal whether so-called critical initialisations exist for each surrogate network, where the network can be trained to arbitrary depth. Moreover, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically, that common weight initialisation schemes used in standard continuous networks, when applied to the mean values of the stochastic binary weights, yield poor training performance. This study shows that, contrary to common intuition, the means of the stochastic binary weights should be initialised close to $\\pm 1$, for deeper networks to be trainable.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The authors study neural networks with binary weights or activations, and the so-called \"differentiable surrogates\" used to train them.\nThey present an analysis that unifies previously proposed surrogates and they study critical initialization of weights to facilitate trainability.\n\nThe reviewers agree that the main topic of the paper is important (in particular initialization heuristics of neural networks), however they found the presentation of the content lacking in clarity as well as in clearly emphasizing the main contributions. \nThe authors imporved the readability of the manuscript in the rebuttal.\n\nThis paper seems to be at acceptance threshold and 2 of 3 reviewers indicated low confidence.\nNot being familiar with this line of work, I recommend acceptance following the average review score."}, "review": {"r1xtybOgir": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rylmoxrFDH", "review": "The paper provides an in-depth exploration of stochastic binary networks, continuous surrogates, and their training dynamics with some potentially actionable insights on how to initialize weights for best performance.

This prompted us to reconsider several contributions that were originally downplayed in the first submission. Briefly these are:\n- novel derivations of both surrogates based on Markov chain representation\n- new reparameterisation trick surrogate for stochastic binary weights *and* neurons\n- correct backpropagation for the deterministic surrogate (not truncated as in Soudry et al.)\n- derivation of critical initialisation for continuous neuron-stochastic binary weight networks\n", "title": "Thank you"}, "B1lIUoQKoH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkxNKaup9B", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and specific issues raised.\n\nWith regards to the following comments:\n\n\"The authors provide concrete advice: the mean of the stochastic weights should be close to +/-1 at initialisation. Being able to give such advice to ML practitioners is of great value, but since this advice feels counter intuitive (naively, the mean of a binary +/-1 activation is typically the output of a tanh, and initialising this close to +/-1 means that gradient are going to be roughly 0, and can easily be exactly 0 in low precision computes).\"\n\n- You are correct that the advice is to initialise the *means* of the stochastic *weights* close to +/-1. Your intuition on activations, such as tanh, saturating and thus producing zero gradients is also right.\n However, we do *not* initialise activations!\nThe theory developed by Poole et al. and Schoenholz et al. actually addresses the saturation of activations, in a more general framework - either looking at forward propagation (we stay (at initialisation) on the linear parts of the activation), or the equivalet of controlling the Jacobian's average (squared) singular values  - if their average =1 (= chi_1), this means there can be no saturation or zero gradient.\nCritical initialisations means precisely this setting (chi_1 =1) .\n\n\"Right now, the justification of this initialisation is hard to find in the paper. This point would deserve a dedicated section, giving a summary of the argument, with references to more technical parts of the paper\"\n\n-Thank you for raising this, it is an important point, and a good suggestion. \n- In the opening of section 3 we have described this idea, pointing to Claims 1 and 3, which establish the +/-1 initialisation of the weights' means. \n- We also emphasise this advice in the introduction and discussion. The paper also has an outline in the introduction which points to these sections.\n- More intuitive explanations (as discussed in our response to your question) are provided in Poole and Schoenholz, and we expect readers would follow this up. Unfortunately we find we are limited for space, otherwise we would include it. We rate these explanations quite highly, and agree with your concern.\n\n\n***Response to specific issues:***\n\n''Missing letters, repeated words or even missing figures (Fig 5 and 7 in the appendix).\"\n- we agree, and have tidied up the paper in this regard.\n\n''Authors need to explain what is Edge of Chaos and give some reference\"\n- We have removed the phrase ''edge of chaos\", since it is equivalent to the set of (sigma_m, sigma_b) which critically initialise the network. This is clear from Definition 1, and claims 1,2,3, in section 3 of the paper. \nFor further information, the term 'edge of chaos' refers to the marginal stability of the c*=1 fixed point of the correlation map c(c^{l-1}) -figure 1.c). If chi=1 at c*=1, the fixed point is marginally stable. This perspective is discussed in Poole et al, Schoenholz et al. and more recently in Hayou et al. We include this discussion in the appendix.\n\n\n''Please, better explain figures, for example Figure 1: need to explain better what this plot is. Why are there both dotted and solid lines?
