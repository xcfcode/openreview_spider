Variants such as LSTM overcome the problem of vanishing gradients to some degree, thus being able to model long-time dependency. Still, these recurrent based models lack the ability of capturing complex semantic compositions. To address this problem, we propose a model which can incorporate local contexts with the guide of global context attention. Both the local and global contexts are obtained through LSTM networks. The working procedure of this model is just like how we human beings read a text and then answer a related question. Empirical studies show that the proposed model can achieve state of the art on some benchmark datasets. Attention visualization also verifies our intuition. Meanwhile, this model does not need pretrained embeddings to get good results.", "keywords": ["Natural language processing", "Deep learning", "Applications"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The consensus amongst reviewers' was that this paper, incorporating global context into classification, is not ready for publication. It provides no novelty over similar methods. The evaluation did not convince most of the reviewers. The paper seems peppered with unjustified and (as rather bluntly, but accurately, put by one reviewer) unscientific claims. Disappointingly, the authors did not respond to pre-review questions. Perhaps more understandably, they did not respond to the uniformly negative reviews of their paper to defend it. I see no reason to diverge from the reviewers' recommendation, and advocate rejection of this paper."}, "review": {"Hk4eV-kXx": {"type": "review", "replyto": "HJlgm-B9lx", "review": "1.
