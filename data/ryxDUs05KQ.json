DSGAN considers the scenario that the training samples of target distribution, $p_{t}$, are difficult to collect.\n\nSuppose there are two distributions  $p_{\\bar{d}}$ and $p_{d}$ such that the density of the target distribution can be the differences between the densities of $p_{\\bar{d}}$ and $p_{d}$. We show how to learn the target distribution $p_{t}$ only via samples from $p_{d}$ and $p_{\\bar{d}}$ (relatively easy to obtain).\n\nDSGAN has the flexibility to produce samples from various target distributions (e.g. the out-of-distribution). Two key applications, semi-supervised learning and adversarial training, are taken as examples to validate the effectiveness of DSGAN.

For example, the authors state that PixelCNN \"does not have a latent representation\" in a manner that makes it sound as if that is a bad thing. If indeed it is, then why so? It would be very helpful to motivate the setting more and to provide a couple of examples of where this method would be useful, in the introduction.\u201d\n>> \u201cWhen is this method useful to readers? For solving which problems and under what conditions? And also, when is this method bad and should not be used?\u201d\n\nWe rephrase the first paragraph in original paragraph to delete some discussions which may be out-of-scope such as PixelCNN and VAE in this paper. We also add a subsection Sec. 1.1 to emphasize our motivations along with the scenario, where the proposed DSGAN will have the ability to generate diverse unseen data that is helpful for one-class classification, semi-supervised learning, and adversarial attacks. Those techniques are important and involve many real applications shown in Fig. 8 in the revised manuscript. \n\n\n>> \u201cThe theoretical results of section 3 are just stated/listed, but are not connected to algorithm 1. Please connect them to the different parts of the algorithm and state in a couple sentences what they imply for the algorithm.\u201d \n\nThe theoretical results in Sec. 3 aims to explain why the objective function in Eq. (2) can learn the wanted distribution. But, Algorithm 1 is to explain the training procedure which may be not directly related to theoretical results. \n\n\n>>\u201dYou should mention in the caption of table 4, what quantity you are computing\u201d \n\nWe replace table 4 (in the original manuscript) with Fig. 7 (in the revised manuscript) for the comprehensive evaluation on both robustness and performance of the models. And the quantity we computed as x-axis (same as the quantity in original table 4) is \u201cepsilon\u201d, which is the l_2 (or l_inf) norm between original image and corresponding adversarial example. The description of epsilon is also added in the caption of Fig. 7.\n\n\n>> \u201cSection 5.1 is hard to follow and I don't quite get how it connects to the rest.\u201d\n\nWe rephrase the descriptions of Sec 5.1 and hope it is more understandable. Briefly saying, Dai et al. (2017) claim that if the generator can satisfy the conditions Eq. (8) and Eq. (9), it can help the semi-supervised learning through the objective function Eq. (5). In our method, if we set the p_{\\bar{d}} to the linear combination of labeled and unlabeled data, then the generator can learn the distribution which satisfies both Eq. (8) and Eq. (9). We use this generator to help semi-supervised learning further.\n\n\n>> \u201cAlso, in section 5.1.2 you mention that in comparison to Dai et al. (2017) your method does not need to rely on an additional density estimation network. Even if that is true, I cannot see how it is a useful remark given that the method of Dai et al. seems to always beat your method.\u201d\n\nFor comparison with Dai et al. (2017) in Sec. 5.1.2, additional density estimation network may not exist always and be expensive to train (also discussed in Lee et al. (2018)). In the contrast, DSGAN is a simple and effective way for generating complementary data. \nWe also claim that the generator might not perfectly learn the distribution we assigned, however, this problem will be attenuated since there are a number of researches on solving this problem.  In Dai et al. (2017), their method relies on feature matching, which aim to match the first-order statistics of the distribution, and it cannot take all the advantages of the progress of GANs. Due to this reason, our method has more benefits in the long term.  The discussion in detail is also in Sec. 5.1.2.\n\n\n>> \u201cIn figure 1, no labels or legends are provided making it hard to figure out what's going on at a glance. It would be very helpful to include labels and a legend.\u201d\n\nWe add the legends to those figures and put more illustrations for our idea. Hope those are helpful for understanding our methods.\n\n\n>>The reformulation of section 3.1 is never justified. What led you to use this reformulation and why do you think it is more stable in practice?\n\nFrom the view of theory, the reformulation is equivalent to original formula. The original reason is that we can use 2m samples instead of 3m samples for each mini-batch. However, we found that the performance also becomes better. Thus, we conjecture that the equivalence may be based on the linearity of expectation, but mini-batch stochastic gradient descent in practical training may lead to the different outcomes. Due to the limit of space, we move Sec. 3.1 (in the original manuscript) to Appendix C (in the revised manuscript).\n\n\n>>Right after theorem 1, which assumption are you referring to when you say \"the assumption in Theorem 1\"?\n\nWe rephrase this sentence \u201cthe assumption in Theorem 1\u201d as \"The assumption, \u03b1 p_{d}(x) \u2264 p_{\\bar{d}}(x) for all x\u2019s in Theorem 1\".\n", "title": "Thanks for your review."}, "rJlhD4gxAm": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJlU9T4ph7", "comment": "We revise the manuscript to answer the comments.  \n\n\n>> \u201cThe main problem of this paper is that it does not provide sufficient results on any real applications that can support its problem&model formulations. For example, in which scenarios would the users of the model need to train a GAN to mimic a target distribution p_t which is a difference of another two distributions (with examples available there but unavailable in p_t)? It would be good to show significant results on real applications to show the problem and the method useful.\u201d \n\u201cTwo applications on semi-supervised classification and adversarial training are discussed. While both seem to be very artificial IMO if considering the used dataset and designed experiments. The results are also not convincing even for the shown two experiments compared to baselines.\u201d\n\nFor responding the suggestions, we add a subsection Sec. 1.1 to emphasize our motivations. Our goal is to generate unseen data, which is absent during training process and is difficult to collect.

The results compared with other methods are discussed in Sec. 5.1.2 and 5.2.2 corresponding to the two experiments.\n\n\n>> \u201cWhile the authors claim new theoretical results, in fact, I didn't see any contributions here as the theories developed in section 3 are mostly rather straightforward.

So I would not recommend the authors to claim contributions here.\u201d\n\nAbout the contribution of theoretical proofs (in Sec. 1.2 in the revised manuscript), we remove the sentences \u201cwhen the optimum of the Jensen-Shannon divergence is attained such that the generator distribution is equal to the target distribution,\u201d which has been covered under [Goodfellow et al. 14].
