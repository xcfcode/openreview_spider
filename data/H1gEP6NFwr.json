Importance of search order: \nYou correctly observe that the tunability metric depends strongly on the order in which different hyperparameters are found, and can have a high variance because of that. In Section 4.1 we acknowledge that variance and explain how we quantify it: We simulate many reruns of the HPO with different random seeds and average the results across those different runs (i.e, for a budget of 4 across all these runs, what is the average CPE/U/L). As we use Random Search as HPO, the simulation of different seeds is achieved by shuffling the iterates. This shuffling and simulating multiple runs would have to replaced with running the code with different random seeds, if a bayesian HPO is used. \n\nd. Calibration details: \nAs Random Search algorithm requires priors to sample from, we calibrate the priors of the tunable parameters for each optimizer according to the calibration procedure described in Section 3.2. This process is only done to find areas of the hyperparameter that are plausible to have higher performance and does not directly contribute to the computed tunability metric.\n\nAdditional details:\nWe use the term tuning budget to refer to the maximum number of times the HPO can call the oracle to get the function value. Each call to the oracle involves one retraining of the neural network itself and returning the appropriate validation metric; this oracle call is termed \u201citeration\u201d. So we perform a total of \u201cbudget\u201d number of \u201citerations\u201d. We use the word \u201cruns\u201d to refer to one exhaustion of the above mentioned budget (to plot variance we simulate various \u201cruns\u201d with different random seeds). Each \u201crun\u201d can be understood as an independent execution of the HPO. \n\nWe have included some of the points of this discussion in the paper. \n\nReferences:\n\nAsi, Hilal, and John C.

Prior distributions of hyperparameters\nb. Loss landscape plots and relation to tunability \nc. Importance of search order\nd. Details of the calibration procedure\n\nWe address them as follows (in two parts):\n\na. Prior distributions of hyperparameters: \nWe envisage an optimizer not merely as update equations, but as the conjunction of the update equations, the hyperparameters, and distributions of those hyperparameters. Those distributions should be prescribed by the designers of the optimizer. This is crucial: For example, if we take Adam with LR between $10^1$ and $10^5$ and claim that Adam is less tunable than others, the evaluation is inherently faulty, as it doesn't capture where the mode of the distribution of LRs for which Adam is expected to work. These prescriptions are absent for the optimizers considered in the paper. Therefore, we define them from either mathematical reasoning (say learning rate is non-negative, $\\beta_1, \\beta_2$ in Adam are between (0, 1) and close to 1) or using the calibration step, where we determine those distributions by fitting on the configurations that yielded reasonably good results. We choose simple priors for their ease of estimation, though given enough computation, arbitrarily complex priors can be computed and used. \n\nWe fail to see the explicit relationship between our work and the papers you have referenced. Specifically [1] only proposes that there is an optimal batch size that is dependent on the momentum parameter. We do not consider tuning the batch size, as we do not consider it a hyperparameter of the optimizer itself. [2] shows that instead of using LR decay schedule, increasing batch size has a similar effects on training, but results in faster training. [3] talks about the existence of an effective learning rate as a function of learning rate and the norm of the weights, and proposes that the optimal learning rate is inversely proportional to the weight decay parameter. This doesn\u2019t, however, trivially lend itself to modeling priors. In summary, these papers show a complex interplay between the parameters giving rise to other notions, but not provide any methods to jointly model these hyperparameters. In the absence of such knowledge, we use our calibration procedure. The distributions we use are justified in section 3.2 in the paper. However, we accept the fact that a more complex distribution that might model the interaction between these hyperparameters might exist, and using that to sample for an HPO would be better. \n\nb. Loss landscape plots and relation to tunability:\nWe show in figures 1.a, 1.b, as you rightly pointed out, the landscapes of loss function of the HPO objective as a function of the hypothetical hyperparameter $\\theta$. There seems to be a misunderstanding of the purpose of figures 1.a, and 1.b.: These figures do not show what we try to measure, but they merely illustrate by example what properties we would like a tunability metric to have. We describe this in the beginning of Section 2. In Section 5, we explain why existing measures of tunability are unable to make the distinction between the cases in Figure 1a.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that the point of Figures 1a, 1b is to illustrate the necessary properties that a proposed metric for tunability - it is not our intention to create such plots for our actual experiments. If you are interested in these nonetheless, a very recent publication by Asi & Duchi (2019) shows the plot of lr vs performance. In summary, they show that the sensitivity of SGD to stepsize choices, which converges only for a small range of stepsizes.

Limited contribution to the qualitative understanding of the optimizers\n    a.i. Informativeness of the proposed w-tunability metric\nb. Using wall-clock time instead of number of HPO oracle calls\n \nWe address these concerns one-by-one.\n\na. Limited contribution to the qualitative understanding of the optimizers:\nWe consider the three main contributions of our work to be 1) a systematic evaluation protocol of optimizers, with off-the-shelf HPO to account for the cost of tuning of hyperparameters. This is missing in existing papers, which consider best attained performance alone. The importance of a proper hyperparameter search protocol is emphasized by Choi et al., 2019 (published after our submission and under review at ICLR). 2) a \u201cw-tunability\u201d measure of the cost of hyperparameter optimization, and 3) under the experiments considered we find that Adam (with default beta and epsilon values) is the most tunable.\n\na.i. Informativeness of the tunability metric: \nWe propose w-tunability as a metric to incorporate the HPO tuning too in reporting the performance of an optimizer, and compute it as a linear combination of the incumbents of the HPO algorithm, though one can use an arbitrarily complex function trading off interpretability.  \n\nIt is true that Figures 4-7 essentially contain all the information needed to judge about the optimizer\u2019s tunability. However, a metric that is easy to compute, interpret and compare optimizers across tasks is crucial, for which we propose w-tunability. This is analogous to computing specific quantities like accuracy, FPR, TPR from the confusion matrix, even though a confusion matrix contains all the information (and is quite cumbersome to compare). \n\nThe summary metric in Figure 2 provides a different interpretation: It reports a normalized performance i.e., the  normalized incumbent performance at iteration $k$. This doesn\u2019t explicitly include information about the previous $k-1$ iterations (which is our central argument). Thus our proposed tunability metric provides more information than the summary statistics plot (figure 2).\n\nDue to this novelty, we argue that our setup does contribute to the qualitative understanding of the optimizers. In fact, it yields to a drastically different valuation of adaptive gradient methods than popular previous work (Wilson et al, Shah et al). You mention that our work is incremental to the work on benchmarking of optimizers. Can you please provide respective references?\n\nWe have modified parts of our paper to reflect these arguments better. \n\nb. Using wall-clock time instead of HPO oracle calls: \nOur reason for using a number of configuration trials instead of a time budget is that measuring number of hyperparameter configuration searches required is more relevant to understand the optimizers\u2019 dependence on the hyperparameters. However, we completely agree with you that computational budget is a relevant factor from the practitioner\u2019s point of view, and added a discussion of this in Appendix E of the paper. As you rightfully point out, the adaptive optimizers tend to converge in fewer number of epochs, amplifying the results that favor Adam over the variants of SGD. \n\nReferences:\n\nWilson, Ashia C., et al. \"The marginal value of adaptive gradient methods in machine learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2017.\n\nShah, Vatsal, Anastasios Kyrillidis, and Sujay Sanghavi. \"Minimum norm solutions do not always generalize well for over-parameterized problems.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.07055 (2018).\n\nChoi, Dami, et al. \"On Empirical Comparisons of Optimizers for Deep Learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.05446 (2019).", "title": "Our main contribution is a fair evaluation protocol for optimizer benchmarking"}, "HkeCkPpMoH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJeWBbVyjS", "comment": "Hi, \n\nThank you for pointing out relevant literature that we missed out.

The tunability of the optimizer is a weighted sum of best performance at a given budget. The authors found that in a setting with low budget for hyperparameter tuning, tuning only Adam optimizer\u2019s learning rate is likely to be a very good choice; it doesn\u2019t guarantee the best possible performance, but it is evidently the easiest to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations.\n\nComments:\n\nThe paper is easy to follow. The motivation of defining tunability of optimizer is a very interesting question, however, the study seems to preliminary and the conclusion is not quite convencing due to several reasons:\n\nIn section 3.2, to characterize its difficulties of finding best hyperparameters or tunability, the authors seem to try to connect the concept of \u201csharpness\u201d of a minima in loss surface to the tunability of an optimizer, which is similar to comparing the loss landscape of minimums. However, while the authors made intuitive explanation about the tunability in section 2.2, I did not see the actual plot of the true hyperpaparameter loss surface of each optimizer to verify these intuitions. Can the author be more specific about the x-axis in the illustration 1.a and 1.b? If I understand correctly, they are not the number of trails.\n\nIn addition, the proposed stability metric seems not quite related with the above intuitions, as the illustrations (1.a and 1b) define the tunability to be the flatness of hyperparameter space around the best configurations, but the proposed definition is a weighted sum of the incumbents in terms of the HPO budgets. \n\nThe definition of the tuning budgets is not clear, is it the number of trials or the time/computation budgets? The authors seems interchangeably using \u201cruns\u201d and \u201citerations\u201d, which makes the concept more confusable. \n\nThe authors further proposed three weighting schemes to emphasize the tunability of different stage of HPO. My concern is that is highly dependent  on the order of hyperparameter searched, which could impact the tunability significantly. For instance, in case of grid search HPO and 0.1 is the best learning rate, different search order such as [10, 1, 0.01, 0.1] and [0.1, 0.01, 1, 10] could results in dramatic different CPE and CPL. \n\nMy major concern is the hyperparameter distributions for each optimizer highly requires prior knowledge. A good prior of one optimizer could significantly affect the HPO cost or increase the tunability, i.e., the better understanding the optimizer, the less tuning cost. My major concern is that the authors assume the hyperparameters to be independent (section 3.2), which is not necessarily true. Actually hyperparameters are highly correlated, such as momentum, batch size and learning rate are correlated in terms of effective learning rate [1,2], so as weight decay and learning rate are [3], which means using non-zero momentum is equivalent to using large learning rate as long as the effective learning rate is the same. This could significantly increase the tunability of SGDM. Another concurrent submission [4] verified this equivalence and showed one can also just tune learning rate for SGDM. The assumption of independent hyperparameters might be fine for black box optimization or with the assumption that practitioners have no knowledge of the importance of each hyperparameter, then the tunability of the optimizer could be different based on the prior knowledge of hyperparameter and their correlations. But it is not rigorous enough to make the conclusion that Adam is easier to tune than SGD.\n\n\nThe author states their method to determine the priors by training each task specified in the DEEPOBS with a large number of hyperparameter samplings and retain the hyperparameters which resulted in performance within 20% of the best performance obtained. Could the authors be more specific on the hyperparameters searched?

A comprehensive empirical comparison of deep learning optimizers, with their performance compared under different amount of hyper-parameter tuning (they perform hyper-parameter tuning using random search).\n2. The introduction of a novel metric that tries to capture the \"tunability\" of an optimizer. This metric attempts to trade off the performance of an optimizer when tuned only with a small number of hyper-parameter trials, and its performance when carefully tuned. The metric is defined as a weighted average of the performance after tuning with i random trials, with i that goes from 1 to K. The weights of this weighted average and K are \"hyper-parameters\" of the metric itself. They use K=100 and suggest 3 possible choices of weights.\n\nThe paper appears to treat 2. as the main contribution. However, I do not think the metric they introduce is good enough to be recommended in future work, when comparing tunability of optimizers (or other algorithms with hyperparameters). The reason is that simpler methods provide just as much information, and do not rely on the need of interpreting the choice of the weights and K. This point is proven in the paper itself, where for example Figure 2 provides a more concrete and easier to interpret information than the tunability metric, similar graphs could be easily provided per dataset. Similarly, figure 3 as well as figures 5-7 and 8 in the appendix provide very good information about the tunability of the various optimizers without using the introduced metrics. Information similar (although not identical) to that summarized in table 5 could be captured by substituting the 3 metrics with the best performance after tuning for 4, 16 and 64 iterations respectively (just as examples).\n\nA stronger contribution is 1., which however is somewhat incremental compared to similar comparisons made in the past. Comparisons which, while mentioned, should perhaps have been discussed and compared more in detail in this work. Overall, I do not feel the comparisons dramatically change the qualitative understanding the field has of the different optimizers and their tunability.\n\nThey also suggest that when the tuning budget is low, using Adam but tuning only the learning rate is beneficial, which could be a valuable and practical suggestion.\n\nI enjoyed reading the submission, which is very clearly written, but due to the relatively limited value of the contributions, and excessive focus on the tunability metric which I do not feel is giustified, I slightly lean against acceptance here at ICLR. I do think, however, that it would make a great submission to a smaller venue or workshop.\n\nOther comments/notes:\n* One aspects that is mostly left out of the discussion (except from one side comment) is the wallclock time, as some optimizers might be on average quicker to train (for example due to quicker convergence), this can easily lead it to be quicker to tune even though it requires a higher budget of trials. I think it would be worth discussing this more.\n* minor: in figure 8 in the appendix, the results after 100 iterations is, as far as I understand, over a single replication, so is not particularly reliable (and will always be 100% of a single optimizer)\n* similarly to the above, if the configurations are always sampled from the same 100, confidence intervals in the graphs become less reliable as the budget increases.", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 2}, "HJeWF-C65S": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rkeO59Qj5B", "comment": "Thank you for your comment!\n\nOur understanding is that you have the following concerns:\n\n1. The definition of tunability boils down to reporting the best hyperparameters for a given budget.\n2. Our analysis provides no novelty considering the previous work in this research area.\n3. Our paper does not provide theoretical results on the generalization abilities of optimizers.\n4. We do not consider learning rate schedules.\n5. Figure 1 and arguments are not valid due to non-convexity of neural networks.\n\nWe would like to address them one by one.\n\n1. \nYour understanding is almost correct. At each step t, we measure the performance of the best hyperparameter configuration up to that point, i.e., for a budget t. We could have chosen particular \u201ct\u201ds to represent small, medium, and large budgets, but this choice would always be arbitrary and can yield different results depending on the choice. To mitigate this issue, we take a weighted average over all steps, where we put more emphasis on the early steps in one case, and more emphasis on the later steps in the other case. This is what \u201cearly stage\u201d and \u201clate stage\u201d refers to. These phrases do NOT refer to the specific configurations found in different stages of the hyperparameter tuning method, which would indeed not make sense, as you point out correctly. Instead, the different weighting schemes account for different opinions of what one might value in an optimizer: Getting to good performances with little tuning effort (Cumulative Performance Early) or achieving best performances with a lot of tuning effort (Cumulutative Performance Late). It's to be noted that merely reporting the best hyperparameters ignores the hyperparameter tuning budget itself, and our metrics of CPU/E/L encode this information.\n\n2.\nWe extensively discuss all three works you mention in the related work section 5. We argue carefully how our paper differs from each of these in important ways.\n\n3.\nWe indeed do not conduct any theoretical analysis of existing optimizers, but we never claim nor intend to do so. While theoretical analyses as conducted by Wilson et al. are interesting and valuable in itself, our paper has an empirical focus and addresses important shortcomings of the experimental setup from previous studies (discussed in Section 5). We are not the only work addressing this important issue: For example, Choi et al. provide evidence that the results obtained by Wilson et al. are only due to their specific hyperparameter search protocol.\n\n4.\nRegarding learning rate schedules, please refer to the reply to the comment of Carmen Amo Alonso addressing the same issue.\n\n5.\nFigure 1 does not show the loss as a function of the model parameters (which is indeed non-convex in most deep neural networks), but as a function of some hyperparameter, e.g., the learning rate. While this function is not necessarily convex either, empirically it often behaves approximately convex (see e.g. Goodfellow et al. Figure 11.1, Schneider et al. Figure 3), so that our figures are not entirely unrealistic. Regardless of this point, our argumentation makes no convexity assumption at any point: The figures show convex functions for the sake of simpler presentation, but our arguments could be visualized with non-convex functions as well.\n\nDami Choi, Christopher J Shallue, Zachary Nado, Jaehoon Lee, Chris J Maddison, and George EDahl.

This is to ensure that the fit is actually based on reasonably well performing configurations only. Crucially, we use the same fit for all datasets, which is in contrast to Choi et al (2019).\n\na. Why we chose lognormal over exponential/other distribution families?\n\nSchneider et al (2019) use a logarithmic grid for learning-rate sampling, which requires an explicit choice of min and max of permissible range. Fixing those bounds can be tricky, as a hard maximum bound will preclude the possibility for any hyperparameter value to exceed that. Also, an exponential distribution has a mode of 0, for all values of \\lambda, whereas a log-normal gives us the freedom to move the mode too. Inspecting the empirical distributions, we found that log-normal was a better fit than log-uniform for all optimizers. Since we do not discuss this in the current draft of the paper, we will add this information as soon as possible.\n\nb. Top 20% performers / optimizers E and F:\n\nAs explained above, empirically, log-normal was the better fit for all the optimizers we considered, which is why we don\u2019t think to have introduced an unfair bias.\nWe emphasize that we all hyperparameter choices that result in a performance that are atleast 80% of the best attained performance from each task are taken, and MLE is computed on the combined top performers across all tasks; this means that there could be more than 0.2*#of tries that resulted in a \"good enough\" performance. To repeat, our priors are computed per optimizer and are made to be task independent (differing from Choi et al (2019)). Referring to optimizers E and F: that figure denotes the full \\theta space for a single (hypothetical) problem. As you say, if the variance of log-normal for E is indeed low across all tasks, the problem of tuning is trivial; merely picking a value that previously worked is already close to optimum. Thus we argue that calibrating on all the tasks together, where the optimum of hyperparameters differs, is important and thus, in that case the variance of the lognormal fit to E will be higher. \n\nc. Do conclusions change with priors?:\n\nOur initial experiments (without calibration) showed similar trends and conclusions (as long as reasonable choices for the priors of the hyperparameters are made), meaning that the effect of the calibration step is likely small for the optimizers we considered. However, we argue that the step is necessary to comply with our described scenario of having a pre-defined distribution to sample from.\n\nRefs: \nDami Choi, Christopher J Shallue, Zachary Nado, Jaehoon Lee, Chris J Maddison, and George EDahl.
