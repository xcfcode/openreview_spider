In contrast, most deep learning architectures deploy computational resources homogeneously to every part of the visual input. Is such a prodigal deployment of resources necessary? In this paper, we present a framework for investigating the extent to which connectionist architectures can perceive an image in full detail even when presented with low acuity, distorted input. Our goal is to initiate investigations that will be fruitful both for engineering better networks and also for eventually testing hypotheses on the neural mechanisms responsible for our own visual system's ability to perceive missing information. We find that networks can compensate for low acuity input by learning global feature functions that allow the network to fill in some of the missing details. For example, the networks accurately perceive shape and color in the periphery, even when 75\\% of the input is achromatic and low resolution. On the other hand, the network is prone to similar mistakes as humans; for example, when presented with a fully grayscale landscape image, it perceives the sky as blue when the sky is actually a red sunset.

It may be interesting to compare to a SOA super-resolution system on that particular task, but we would not expect our simple networks to compete with such systems (neural-network based or otherwise). We kept the network simple to more easily study their behavior (on various types of input degradations, not just low resolution) and the nature of the learnt solution.\n\n2. Good question. We find AE to be a natural model for this problem because the output is easy to visually interpret. The idea could be easily extend to other kinds of autoencoders (with other types of layers or architectures), but it is less clear whether they could be directly extended to a classification architectures. The two problems here are (1) a lot of data would be required to provide enough constraints on the weights (2) how to know whether detail is being perceived or whether another signal is learned that happens to correlate with the classification problem.", "title": "Re: This paper is well motivated"}, "B1LEVUNUg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SyiMEjbEg", "comment": "Great suggestion about evaluating both the periphery and the fovea separately. As you suggest, this would provide more direct evidence that the high resolution areas are helping the low resolutions areas. And indeed, for some of our foveation functions it may be possible to tease apart the two regions and evaluate them separately.\n\nComparing structured noise to random noise (denoising AE) would be interesting as well.\n\nRE: Other issues. We will integrate your suggestions, thanks.", "title": "Re: Interesting idea, evaluation could be improved"}, "B10kVIEUl": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJKn4tNEx", "comment": "Thanks for your comments. We agree that there are some burning questions left unanswered, but at the same time hope that our initial data provides some interesting insights about a relatively unexplored area of research. As a first pass, we presented a breadth of problems to understand what a relatively simple network is capable of. It\u2019s true that we did not explore each problem in depth but we wanted to gain an understanding on what happens under these three conditions: (1) foveations (2) missing information (scotomas) (3) presence or absence of color information in the fovea.\n\nRE: MSE evaluation. Good point about texture.  Indeed MSE is not a perfect quantitative evaluation metric, but it would seem that nearly all other metrics have the same problems with texture. To help overcome MSE's deficiencies we also supply the actual output reconstructions so that they may also be qualitatively judged. Our conclusions regarding texture were not from an artifact of MSE, but from our own visual inspections of the images in which we determined much of the high frequency information in the periphery was clearly missing or inaccurate. \n\nRE: ability to perform color reconstruction. We share your intuition about the sepia tones. There are some rare instances of the network learning to correlate shape and color for completely black and white foveation functions, but this was the exception not the norm. One case that is interesting is that the network colors a black&white sky as blue (actually this is incorrect because the sky happened to be a red sunset) by employing a learned global blue color feature. Again, this is a rare case and in general the network requires some color information, but we can only speculate on why.", "title": "Re: some interesting cases, but lacks focus"}, "BkZ7uj-Ee": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkfAwK-Ne", "comment": "Yes, that is correct, the \"original\" row in Fig 3 corresponds to no downsampling.

Further, the output of an AE can be visually inspected and interpreted.  Classification is a bit brutal in that it reduces a complex high-dimensional image to a single concept (label) and is thus unsuitable as a surrogate for \"perceiving.\"  It is unclear whether similar global features would emerge in a classification setting (though it might be possible to transfer them from the AE).  We are not trying to disparage classification---it is a very useful task---rather we are merely pointing out that classification is not ideal for the problem we are studying.\n\n\"What is the potential usage of the model? Can the model improve the performance of computer vision tasks, such as classification on ImageNet, Image retrieval, low-level image processing, etc? Is there any comparison on some specific tasks?\"\n\nGood question.  We are interested in studying if and how the network copes with various input stimuli and what the nature of its solution is and how it behaves. Thus, the primary use of the model is for scientific discovery/insight rather than engineering. That said, one potential practical use is to save memory/bandwidth on the GPU.  The global features might allow us to transfer and store images with smaller memory footprints for different vision tasks. However, we did not investigate this aspect in our paper.\n\n\"Is there any quantitative comparison with other attention-based models...\"\n\nSorry for the confusion:  although we briefly discuss attention in the paper, it is outside the scope of this work.  In future work we would probably employ a mechanism similar to Mnih 2014 or one of the others you mention and study its behavior.", "title": "Re: Why does the paper use AE in the framework?

The paper you mention is indeed very impressive.  However, we do not compare to such systems as our goals are a bit different.  In particular, we're more interested in studying the behavior of the network under different types of degraded/foveated inputs in order to understand if and how the network copes with various stimuli. With this goal in mind, rather than employing a more complicated network engineered for super-resolution, we chose to study a simple network to facilitate interpretation of the results and the learnt mechanisms behind them.\n\nSorry for the confusion, \"original\" refers to the fact that the image is not foveated, that it is indeed the original image as it appears in the dataset.", "title": "Re: Some questions"}, "Hy3EYCu7x": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Sy-qrKJXx", "comment": "Thanks for your engaging question, we are happy to elaborate on the results and conclusions. We agree that (a) and (b) are not the most interesting takeaways and are perhaps overemphasized due to their early appearance in the paper. A more important behavioral difference occurs between homogeneous (uniformly down-sampled) and heterogeneous (small fovea of high detail) foveations.  The difference is especially noticeable for color reconstruction. Indeed, the network often struggles to reconstruct fully grayscale inputs (an example of a homogeneous foveation), producing mostly sepia tones (see Figure 6b \"no color\").  Yet, when given a small high-detail area of color, the network performs much better (see Figure 6b, \"25% color\").  Figure 6c quantifies (via MSE) the differences between these types of foveations:  the 25% color performs similarly to full color input, both of which performs twice as well as no color.  We find it interesting that a mixture of low and high detail input regions appears to be important for filling in details and it might be worth thinking about what type of inductive bias these heterogeneous inputs are imposing on the weights (something we have not yet explored).\n\nA practical takeaway relevant to classification is that a heterogeneous down-sampling strategy might save space or bandwidth on the GPU (e.g., by discarding most, but not all of the color information).  While it is unclear whether a classification task provides enough constraints on the weights to learn the appropriate global features, it might be possible to reuse the features learnt by the autoencoder to save space on the GPU: although it requires more memory to store the weights for these features, the memory cost would be amortized over all the images in the dataset. Note however, that although our network is good at reconstructing color and shape information, it fails at texture. Thus, if the classification task depends heavily on texture then the global features might be unreliable. We would expect classification degradation to depend on the type of classification problem.  Your suggestion on varying the input to evaluate global features is very intriguing, and we need to think a bit more about how to turn this into an evaluation.\n\nWe further hope that the phenomenon of the emergence of global features will eventually help hone in on theories of how the primate visual system performs perceptual filling-in.   Existing theories about the underlying neural mechanisms vary, but some, for example, rely on the existence of lateral connections between neurons.  Yet global features do not inherently require such connections and indeed our network lacks them.  It would be interesting to see if these simple networks exhibit similar behaviors as humans when presented controlled stimuli or optical illusions (see for example, www.uniformillusion.com for examples of filling-in illusions).", "title": "Re: Conclusions and Significance?"}, "Sy-qrKJXx": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Sk36NgFeg", "review": "Can you provide more detail or comparisons on the significance of the different behaviors of the net under the different types and foveations?\n\nAt the moment, I feel this paper is lacking clear, concise takeaways.
