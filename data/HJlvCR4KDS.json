However, when the model\u2019s answer is \u2018no,\u2019 existing methods have difficulty in revealing detailed arguments that lead to that answer. In addition, previous methods are insufficient to provide logical bases, when the question requires common sense to answer. In this paper, we propose a novel textual explanation method to overcome the aforementioned limitations. First, we extract keywords that are essential to infer an answer from a question. Second, for a pre-trained explanation generator, we utilize a novel Variable-Constrained\nBeam Search (VCBS) algorithm to generate phrases that best describes the relationship between keywords in images. Then, we complete an explanation by feeding the phrase to the generator. Furthermore, if the answer to the question is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d we apply Natural Langauge Inference (NLI) to identify whether contents of the question can be inferred from the explanation using common sense. Our user study, conducted in Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), shows that our proposed method generates more reliable explanations compared to the previous methods. Moreover, by modifying the VQA model\u2019s answer through the output of the NLI model, we show that VQA performance increases by 1.1% from the original model.", "keywords": ["Image Captioning", "Visual Question Answering", "Explainable A.I", "Beam Search", "Constrained Beam Search"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper is good, with relatively positive support from the reviewers.

I would keep my score unchanged (i.e., 6 Weak Accept). \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nStrengths: \n- The paper enhances the beam search approach to generate explanations for answers to visual questions. The explanations are further used for verifying the yes/no answers.\n- The paper constructs a VCBS algorithm with novelties in allowing soft constrains of the generated beams. Since I have not worked on the constrained beam search before, thus it is hard for me to measure the novelty of this method.\n- The results of VQA 2.0 is pretty good. The accuracy of the Yes/No questions almost achieves the SotA systems. \n\n\nWeakness:\n- I have a question about the NLI system. Since the NLI is a three-way classifier where the answers would be \"Entail\", \"Contradictory\", and \"Neutral\".  What would the system do when the relationship is \"Neutral\"? For now, I think that it just give an answer of \"no\" but I am not sure whether it is correct.  For example, in Fig. 3, it shows an explanation (premise) of \"something (not the vegetable) on a plate\" and the hypo is \"there are vegetables on the plate\". Since the hypo is not necessary to contradict the premise, the relationship should be neutral. It does not directly provide evidence of the answer.\n\nComments:\n- Since more data are involved in training the explanation system, the proposed methods are not fairly compared with the BAN method. It would be better to mention this detail in the paper. \n\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 3}, "SyxclpUcsS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1x8vBV6tS", "comment": "We are obliged to get your suggestion and advice, and it is an honor to have your assistance.\n\n1) I have a question about the NLI system.

In this experiment, we set the VQA model\u2019s answer as \"yes\" if the class probability of the NLI model for \"Entail\" is greater than \"Contradictory,\" even though the NLI result is \"Neutral.\"\n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, we found that the answer is often \"yes,\" even when there is little correlation between premise and hypothesis. For this reason, we use the answer as \"yes\" only if the NLI result is \"Entail,\u201d as we first suggested in the paper.\n\np.s-\nIn Fig 3, the premise is \"a slice of pizza is sitting on a plate.\" \"something (not the vegetable) on a plate\" is a sentence added to visualize which keyword is absent in the image.\n\n2) Since more data are involved in training the explanation system, the proposed methods are not fairly compared with the BAN method.

It relies on external models or tools for natural language inference, and such inference does not take into account the visual context of the image. Also, the explanations generated from the proposed model only justify the answer but are not introspective, and they do not reflect the decision process of the target VQA model.\n\nWe agree with the issue the reviewer has pointed out. It's best to do inference using both visual and linguistic information at the same time, but unfortunately, we have not solved this problem yet. Therefore, we proposed a method of inference by using Visual and Linguistic information step by step. We also agree that explanations created in the proposed way are not introspective.  For this reason, we have revised the content of this paper as follows: (the proposed method not only produces more introspective explanations, ... ->  the proposed method not only produces more appropriate explanations, ...)\n", "title": "Response to Review #2"}, "rJgxc285jS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJlJyunRKB", "comment": "We greatly appreciate your kind and detail review.

For this reason, we have revised the content of this paper as follows: (the proposed method not only produces more introspective explanations, ... -> the proposed method not only produces more appropriate explanations, ...).\n\n2) The technique novelty of the proposed paper is also limited; the major novelty is the VCBS, which seems very similar to CBS. The only difference is VCBS adds relaxed parameters, which seems no technique novelty.\n\nVCBS differs from CBS in that it uses loosening parameters and the number of satisfied constraints ( | y and C | ). Therefore VCBS helps to identify the keywords that cause the VQA's answer to be \"no.\" It is the first attempt to determine the cause of \"no,\" which is extremely hard for existing methods. \n\nWe also leveraged the NLI model and ConceptNet to create explanations that require common sense. For these aforementioned reasons, we think our proposed scheme is novel enough. \n\n3) Most annotations in Algorithm 1 is also not explained, making the readers hard to follow the actual content.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful comment. We have revised the paper to make it easier for readers to understand the meaning of each notation in Algorithm 1.\n\n4) The proposed model, although tied the VQA words with the explanation words, suffers the same problems as the PJ-X model, which didn't consider the VQA attention at all.\n\nAlthough the BUTD is used as an explanation generator, the method presented in this paper (i.e., VCBS and NLI) can also utilize the PJ-X or the Multi-VQAE as an explanation generator. To illustrate this, we conducted an additional experiment using Multi-VQAE as an explanation generator and included sample results in the Appendix.\n As a result of replacing the explanation generator of our method to Multi-VQAE, we show that we can improve the explanations generated by the model (Multi-VQAE) while considering VQA attentions.\n\n\n5) The experiment is also weak, considering the results is conduct on 100 samples, there might be significant variance.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful consideration. We experimented with 100 additional samples and added the results to the Appendix. We have confirmed that we get results similar to the previous experiments.\n\n6) It's interesting the compared approach is learned based on a different dataset, which makes the results harder to compare. The NLI model results are interesting, but for a more fair comparison, I would expect the proposed method compare with a model trained with VQA and coco caption dataset, such as VQA-E.\n\nThank you again for your sincere advice. We understand what the reviewer is worried about. We post additional results using the Multi-VQAE as an explanation generator in the Appendix. As a result of applying our method to Multi-VQAE, we can see that more appropriate explanations are generated\n", "title": "Response to Review #1"}, "S1gXpfnhFB": {"type": "review", "replyto": "HJlvCR4KDS", "review": "\nThe paper proposes a novel method for explaining VQA systems. Different from most previous work, the proposed approach generates textual explanations based on three steps. First, it extracts keywords from the question. Then an explanation sentence is decoded (based on an RNN image captioner) through the proposed Variable-Constrained Beam Search (VCBS) algorithm to satisfy the keyword constraints. Finally, 3) checking through linguistic inference whether the explanation sentence can be used as a premise to infer the question and answer.\n\nI would recommend for acceptance. The paper proposes an alternative approach to VQA explanations, together with a few supporting algorithms such as VCBS. It is potentially helpful to future work on textual explanations and explainable AI in general.\n\nAt a high level, it is ambiguous to decide what is a reasonable explanation for many \u201cno\u201d answers. For example, one usually cannot provide stronger justification than \u201cthere is indeed no one\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone\u201d to the question \u201cIs there anyone in the room\u201d with an answer \u201cno.\u201d The paper frames this explanation generation task as a linguistic inference task and checks entailment between the explanation and the question-answer pair.
