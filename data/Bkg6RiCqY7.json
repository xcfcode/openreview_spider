While common implementations of these algorithms employ L$_2$ regularization (often calling it ``weight decay'' in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by \\emph{decoupling} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

An impressively thorough set of experiments are given to demonstrate the improved generalization performance, as well as a decoupling of the hyperparameters. \n\nPrevious versions of the paper suffered from a lack of theoretical justification for the proposed method. Ordinarily, in such cases, one would worry that the improved results could be due to some sort of experimental confound. But AdamW has been validated by so many other groups on a range of domains that the improvement is well established. And other researchers have offered possible explanations for the improvement.\n"}, "review": {"Bkx6qDs50m": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJxk4OZ5AQ", "comment": "Thank you very much for your positive evaluation!

In contrast, SGDW does not have \\lambda in Line 6 but has it in Line 9, where \\lambda and \\alpha are decoupled. Please note that Algorithm 1 uses two different colors to define specifics of SGD and SGDW when regularization is applied. We hypothesize that this confusion might have been caused by a black&white printout (in which the original colors were not easy to tell apart) and to avoid this confusion in the future we changed the colors to also be clearly distinguishable when printed in black&white. \n\n\nThanks again for your review!

Nevertheless, we still believe the proposition to be useful since (for this simple special case of a fixed preconditioner) it provides a precise equivalence between decoupled weight decay and standard L2 regularization with a scaled regularizer and thus provides an intuitive explanation for what decoupled weight decay does: parameters with a small preconditioner (which in practice would be caused by typically large gradients in this dimension) are regularized relatively more than they would be with L2 regularization; specifically, the regularization is proportional to the inverse of the root of the preconditioner. \nFor adaptive gradient algorithms with changing preconditioner matrices (which includes all popular cases) there is no 1-to-1 equivalence to a fixed L2 regularization, but we can still use the intuition from the proposition to think about what loss function is being optimized in each step.\n\n                                                                                       ***\n\n\"However, the last paragraph of Section 3 seems to utilize the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to promote the idea that with large datasets the prior distribution is unimportant (and is ignored).

After a closer analysis of the argument by Aitchison described in the last paragraph of Section 3, we are also less convinced about it: due to the equivalence of L2 regularization and weight decay in SGD settings (our Proposition 1), one should not expect them to scale differently with the dataset size, as the argument would suggest.

The results show that Adam and its variants with decoupled weight decay converge faster (in terms of training loss) on CIFAR-10 than the corresponding SGD variants (the difference for ImageNet32x32 is small). As is discussed in the main paper, when the same values of training loss are considered, AdamW demonstrates better values of test error than Adam.

The largest part of the difference between SGD and Adam was linked to weight decay and L2 regularization, but we believe that this is not the case anymore for SGDW and AdamW.

As the authors write, this work has already been impactful and motivated a great deal of further research. The empirical evaluation is convincing and the results have been reproduced and further studied by others. A moderate amount of space in the paper (Section 3, Section 4.5) is used to refer to work motivated by the paper itself. While I do not take issue with this I believe it should be considered for the final decision (in the sense that disentangling the contributions of the authors and related work becomes tricky). With this said, I continue with my review.\n\nPaper summary: The authors observe that L2 regularization is not effective when using the Adam optimizer. By replacing L2 regularization with decoupled weight decay the authors are able to close the generalization gap between SGD and Adam and make Adam more robust to hyperparameter settings. The empirical evaluation is comprehensive and convincing.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1) The authors emphasize the fact that L2 regularization and weight decay are not the same for different optimizers and claim that this goes against the belief of some practitioners.

The authors share the observation of Aitchison, 2018 that decoupled weight decay can be recovered in this framework. My interpretation is that this observation is important _because_ of the empirical observations in this paper and does not necessarily provide theoretical support for the approach. However, the last paragraph of Section 3 seems to utilize the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to promote the idea that with large datasets the prior distribution is unimportant (and is ignored). I am not sure that I follow this argument. For example, this claim seems to be completely independent of the optimization algorithm used and moreover Propositions 1,2, and 3 are independent of the data distribution. I suspect that this confusion is due to a misunderstanding on my part and would appreciate clarification from the authors.\n\n4) The empirical evaluation in this paper is very strong and these practical techniques have already been adopted by the community in addition to spurring novel research. The empirical observation broadly explores two directions: decoupled weight decay leads to separable hyperparameter search spaces (meaning optimization is less sensitive to hyperparameters), and decoupled weight decay gives improved generalization (and training performance). Both claims are explored throughly with strong evidence given for the improvement due to AdamW.\n\nOverall, I find this paper to be presented well and with convincing empirical results. I feel that the theoretical justification for decoupling weight decay are a little weak, and believe that other work is moving towards better explanations then the ones presented in this paper [1,2,3].

The authors also cited a recent work to provide a justification of their proposed update rules from the perspective of Bayesian filtering. To demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods, experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet32x32 are conducted to compare with the original methods. Results show that the proposed methods consistently lead to faster convergence. Overall the paper is well written and easy to follow, with enough details describing the experimental settings. \n\nFirst of all I appreciate the authors pointing out that weight decay is not equal to L2 regularization in general. This is evident once the original definition of weight decay is given. The main motivation comes from the argument that instead of using L2 regularization, weight decay should be used in adaptive gradient methods. The Bayesian filtering interpretation helps to justify the proposed method. But it is not clear to me why the hyperparameters w and \\alpha are decoupled in the proposed methods? For example, in Line 6 of Alg. 1, g_t is a function of w, and later in Line 8, g_t is coupled with \\alpha which naturally introduces a term w \\alpha into m_t. So both w and \\alpha are still coupled together in the proposed algorithm. If this is the case why the authors still call w and \\alpha decoupled? \n\nTo me the most interesting result is Proposition 3 where the authors show that weight decay actually corresponds to preconditioned L2 regularization. This helps to explain what's the algorithmic difference between these two methods in adaptive gradient methods, and provides an intuitive insight on why weight decay may lead to better results compared with the vanilla L2 regularization. \n\nExperiments on image recognition tasks basically confirm the authors' claims. However, as the authors have already pointed out, it is better to have more thorough experiments on other kinds of tasks, e.g., in text classification, etc. If the improvement does come from the difference between weight decay vs L2, then I would also expect the same improvement on other tasks. It would be great to see more experimental results on other tasks to have a better understanding of this problem. So far it is not clear whether the same improvement holds in general or not. \n", "title": "Review", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}}}
