Here we investigate embodiment and a closed loop between action and perception as one key component in this process. We take a close look at the representations learned by a deep reinforcement learning agent that is trained with visual and vector observations collected in a 3D environment with sparse rewards. We show that this agent learns semantically meaningful and stable representations of its environment without receiving any semantic labels. Our results show that the agent learns to represent the action relevant information extracted from pixel input in a wide variety of sparse activation patterns. The quality of the representations learned shows the strength of embodied learning and its advantages over fully supervised approaches with regards to robustness and generalizability.", "keywords": ["reinforcement learning", "deep learning", "embodied", "embodiment", "embodied cognition", "representation learning", "representations", "sparse coding"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "What is investigated is what kind of representations are formed by embodied agents; it is argued that these are different than from non-embodied arguments.

I was on my honeymoon during this time and did not have access to hardware capable of training any kind of new setup. If you didn't like the idea of the auto encoder it would have been nice to know that soon after I suggested it, before I waste days of my honeymoon stressing about adapting the paper to it. It would have also been nice to receive your comment less close to the deadline so we have time to respond to it and justify our decision. We chose the auto encoder as it is a very commonly used way of training a neural network in an unsupervised fashion and we wanted to point out the difference of our approach to other commonly used approaches. Of course we will also perform an analysis on your suggested training set up and I will update the paper as soon as I have the results.", "title": "Justification for the Experiment Used"}, "B1el1NKijH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJxQskxsir", "comment": "We agree with the concerns regarding the objective optimized by the autoencoder. However, it is clearly a better comparison than the previous baseline. Further, as the reviewer points out, there is no canonical choice of a baseline for comparison. Therefore, we consider the comparison to the auto encoder as valuable. We phrased our conclusions carefully and point out that they are obtained by comparison to the autoencoder. In this way we think that our claims are carefully and correctly phrased. \n\nIn addition, we would like to state that obviously any setup different from the embodied agent setup will enforce different types of representations. This is unavoidable and one of the main points of the paper. We like to show that the way a network is trained has a huge impact on the kind of representations learned and that the representations learned with a closed loop between action and perception are closer to representations found in nature than the ones learned in other classical training setups without dense semantic labeling such as an auto encoder. We therefore do not agree that that the autoencoder enforcing a denser representation is a reason for rejection as it is a key fact that we are presenting and part of the main message. We will try to formulate this more clearly in the paper. \n\nWe agree that there are other setups out there that would isolate embodiment more clearly and we will explore this further in the future. However, we think that already the representation analysis in itself and the comparison to a standard architecture like the autoencoder present very valuable insights, motivating many further research directions.\n\nSincerely,\nThe authors\n", "title": "Regarding concerns"}, "Skxrl81XsB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJgrTBn1KS", "comment": "Dear Reviewer #1,\n\nThank you for your very insightful feedback. We greatly appreciate your concerns about the paper and have thought a lot about how to better demonstrate the strength of the results and their novelty. Based on your comments we decided to take these actions:\n\n-\tWe agree that the comparison to a random agent is a rather soft baseline. Therefore, we now include further analysis comparing the agent trained in an embodied set up to an auto encoder trained on the same visual stimuli. The results from this analysis show that the representations of the visual input in the embodied agent are very different to the representation learned by the auto encoder. There is a much stronger encoding of actions in the embodied agent and no more action encoding in the trained action encoder than in the random network. \n\n-\tThis observation might be considered as obvious. However, the difference of representations in the visual module under different training conditions is an important factor when analyzing representation learning. We think that this insight is important to keep in mind when studying the brain and the mechanisms of what kind of representations are learned under which conditions are interesting to study. As the learning conditions of an embodied network are closer to the ones of humans and animals we think it is interesting to investigate these representations further.\n\n-\tYour concern for section 3.3 that many CNNs are over-parameterized, regardless of embodiment, will be addressed by the addition of the results from the trained auto encoder. It is true that many CNNs trained in a supervised setup are over-parameterized, however, those CNNs are usually bigger than two layers and often have input of a smaller dimensionally. In our setup the input has dimensionality 84.672 and is compressed to a vector of size 256 which is only about 0.3% of the original input size. When training the autoencoder with a network of the same structure it learns no sparse representations of the input and uses most neurons in 100% of the input frames with varying strengths in the activations while the embodied network activates its neurons much more selectively.\n\n-\tIn your last comment you point out that it is obvious that similar images will be next to each other in the t-SNE visualization. We apologize for this misunderstanding. It addresses the core message of the manuscript that conceptually similar images, not perceptually similar images, are close in the representational space. This is the very advantage of reinforcement learning by the embodied agent. We will revise and precisely phrase the respective sections and figure 7. When looking at the representations of the auto encoder such conceptual similarities are not as strongly encoded, and focus is more on pure perceptual similarities such as overall illumination.\n\nAfter adding these changes and additional results we would be very happy if you could take another look and evaluate our results under the light that this is the first step of a bigger project investigating the relationship between training environment, training conditions, and learned representations. Even though this paper alone might not be ground breaking, it lays the foundations of many more results to come investigating no reward tasks using curiosity, hierarchical representations and different learning schemes to make network training more biologically inspired.\n\nSincerely,\nthe authors", "title": "Reviewer #1 - Reply"}, "BylBESy7iH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hylx6OChtB", "comment": "Dear reviewer #3,\n\nWe are very grateful for your comments and feedback on the paper and will work them into the revised paper. Originally the random agent presented itself as a good comparison as we could use the exact same network structure, input and representation dimensionality. However, we understand that this is not the most convincing comparison we can make and have already trained an auto encoder on the static observations collected by the embodied agent, using the same network structure up to the encoding layer. We will include these results in the revised version of the paper and contrast them with the representations learned by the embodied agent. We hope that these additional results will help us make a stronger point than the comparison to a random agent.\n\nAdditionally, we apologize for the use of he/him to refer to the agent.

We will add the analysis of the representations learned in the autoencoder and compare them to the representations of the embodied agent.

In general the motivation is quite strong, and research along these directions will no doubt be of value to the field.\n\nTo assess their hypothesis, the authors compare the representations learned in trained vs. random agents on the Unity Obstacle Tower Challenge, and demonstrate that trained agents develop semantically meaningful, sparse representations, without explicit regularization. \n\nUnfortunately, the work doesn\u2019t provide adequate baselines to properly assess the hypothesis. With the data presented, we can only make claims about *trained* vs. *untrained* agents (both of which are embodied!). In other words, an embodied agent with a random policy is not equivalent to a non-embodied agent. Thus, the data only support the conclusion that performance and task-relevant policies drive good representation learning in embodied agents, which is altogether not surprising, as one wouldn\u2019t expect representations to be good in a randomly initialized network. \n\nTo assess wither *embodiment* is a critical factor for driving good representations, the authors should compare to a model that learns from a static supervised dataset.

The paper shows that the activations are sparse and the activation patterns are distinct and shows that the conceptually similar images are clustered together in t-sne visualization.\n\nPaper Strengths:\n\nThe paper starts with a nice introduction that embodiment is useful for perception. However, the main content of the paper is very different from the introduction.\n\nPaper Weaknesses:\n\nThe conclusions of the paper are either already known or very trivial. So there is nothing new for the community to benefit from. Please refer to my comments below for more information.\n\nThe conclusion of section 3.3 is that \"the agent learns to use sparse activation patterns and even leaves some of the available neurons completely unused\". This has nothing to do with embodiment. The same patterns are observed in non-dynamic tasks such as image classification. The CNNs are usually over-parameterized.\n\nThe conclusion of section 3.4 is that \"When comparing this with the encodings of a random untrained agent one can see that there is a clear association between the learned image encoding and the actions\". That is the whole point of training. We train the models to find correlations between actions and observations. It is obvious that there is more correlation compared to a random agent.\n\nIt is shown in section 3.5 that similar images will be next to each other in the t-sne visualization. It is obvious that this happens.\n\nDue to the issues mentioned above, I do not think there is anything new in the paper and I vote for rejection.\n\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "1: Reject", "confidence": 4}, "rkgKdL1RtS": {"type": "review", "replyto": "r1lEd64YwH", "review": "Paper summary:\n\nThis is an empirical study of the representations learned by a reinforcement learning agent. An agent is trained, using a standard RL algorithm, to solve puzzles by navigating through a 3D visual environment (Unity obstacle tower challenge). The analyses in the paper show that the visual representations of the trained agents are sparse and cluster according to the actions performed by the agent. The goal of the paper is to show that these features are due to the embodied nature of the agent. Specifically, the paper states that \u201cthe quality of the representations learned shows the strength of embodied learning and its advantages over fully supervised approaches with regards to robustness and generalizability\u201d.\n\nDecision:\n\nI suggest to reject this paper. While the topic is interesting and the paper is clearly written, there is a lack of control/comparison experiments, such that the paper\u2019s conclusions are not backed up by the analyses. However, with more experiments, I think this line of research has large potential.\n\nFurther justification for the decision:\n\nMy main criticism is that the paper claims to show that embodiment is important for representation learning, but never actually compares representations learned by an embodied agent to representations learned in some other way.\n\nComparing to a random network is a sanity check, but not sufficient to support the paper\u2019s claims.\n\nOne way to experimentally dissociate embodiment/agency from supervised learning would be to train two separate models, one that is \u201cembodied\u201d/active, and another that gets the same sensory input, but without embodiment (\u201cpassive\u201d). The passive network could be trained using the sensory inputs recorded while training the active network. The passive network could be trained to predict the value and/or the actions of the active network. Thus, the passive network would be trained in a supervised way, whereas the active network would be trained by RL (i.e. in an embodied way).\n\nThe representations of the two networks could then be compared using the analyses used in the paper. This setup would experimentally isolate the effect of embodiment. Without such comparisons, it is unclear whether representations learned in a supervised way would be any different from those learned by RL.\n\nIn addition to the descriptive analyses presented in the paper, a transfer learning approach could test whether there is actually a functional difference between the \u201cembodied\u201d and the supervised representations: Take the representations of the \u201cactive agent\u201d and the \u201cpassive agent\u201d and freeze the weights. Then re-initialize and re-train only the dense layer before the action probabilities on the RL task, leaving everything else frozen. Does the model from the \u201cactive agent\u201d do better on the RL task? This would suggest that the embodied agent learned better representations.\n\nMinor comment: The website contains a link to a YouTube profile that is not completely anonymous (it contains the first name and a profile photo).
