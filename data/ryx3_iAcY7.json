It is left to the subsequent layers of the network to extract relevant aspects of a word's meaning based on the context in which it appears. In this paper, we investigate whether word representations can be improved by explicitly incorporating the idea of latent roles. That is, we propose a role interaction layer (RIL) that consists of context-dependent (latent) role assignments and role-specific transformations. We evaluate the RIL on machine translation using two language pairs (En-De and En-Fi) and three datasets of varying size. We find that the proposed mechanism improves translation quality over strong baselines with limited amounts of data, but that the improvement diminishes as the size of data grows, indicating that powerful neural MT systems are capable of implicitly modeling role-word interaction by themselves. Our qualitative analysis reveals that the RIL extracts meaningful context-dependent roles and that it allows us to inspect more deeply the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems.", "keywords": ["Neural Machine Translation", "Natural Language Processing"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper proposes to improve MT with a specialized encoder component that models roles.

By designing and carefully evaluating meaningful model extensions we can learn a lot about both the model extensions and the baseline. For instance, in our case we find that the RIL exhibits its intended behavior and improves the translation quality when there is a limited amount of data (which is an important use case for machine translation), although there is no visible improvement on larger datasets. We thus draw an interesting conclusion from this observation that the baseline can/must learn something similar implicitly *if* enough data is available.\n", "title": "Rebuttal"}, "HJgD1tOZTX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hkxk2bKt2X", "comment": "We thank you for your thorough review. \n\n\u201cwe cannot say that the proposed algorithm is better than the baseline.\u201d\n\nWe agree that we cannot say that our addition is better than the baseline on the larger datasets we considered.\n\n\u201cWhy the NMT systems trained on large dataset can \u201cimplicitly modeling role-word interaction\u201d, while small dataset cannot?\u201d\n\nWe conjecture that a neural translation system does not exhibit an appropriate inductive bias that encourages it to capture role interaction and cannot learn to do so when only a small amount of data is available. The proposed approach equips the neural translation model with the appropriate inductive bias that allows it to exploit role interaction to do better. However, with a large enough data, our observation suggests that this explicit inductive bias is unnecessary as the neural translation system can learn this role interaction property on its own from data.\n", "title": "Rebuttal"}, "r1x3n_uZam": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJexH879hX", "comment": "We thank you for your thorough review. \n\n\u201cIs the main purpose of the proposed method \u201cimproving the performance\u201d or \u201cinterpretability\u201d?\u201d\n\u201cThe contribution of this paper is not very clear.\u201d\n\u201cThe improvements from baseline method (Matched) is less than 1 point BLEU as shown in Table 1 and 2, which is not a significant improvement.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of this work was to give existing architectures a better inductive bias. The results of such an effort can be either or both better performance or/and better interpretability.  A stronger inductive bias typically leads to better generalization, which is often more necessary in the low-data regime, and our experiments clearly show that the proposed approach indeed improves the translation quality (better performance) when the amount of data is limited. Even when it does not offer better performance due to the availability of large data, the proposed RIL facilitates the interpretation of a model, which provides us with a deeper understanding of what these neural translation models are learning.\n\n\u201ctechnically the proposed method is closely related to the method proposed in [Shu+,2018].\u201d\n\nThe method proposed by Shu et al. [2018] is indeed related to our proposal. Our role assignments are however learned end-to-end with the downstream task while Shu et al. learn the codes of pre-trained embedding matrices.
