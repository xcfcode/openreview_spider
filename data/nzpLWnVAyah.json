Despite the strong empirical performance of fine-tuned models, fine-tuning is an unstable process: training the same model with multiple random seeds can result in a large variance of the task performance. Previous literature (Devlin et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Dodge et al., 2020) identified two potential reasons for the observed instability: catastrophic forgetting and small size of the fine-tuning datasets. In this paper, we show that both hypotheses fail to explain the fine-tuning instability. We analyze BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT, fine-tuned on commonly used datasets from the GLUE benchmark, and show that the observed instability is caused by optimization difficulties that lead to vanishing gradients. Additionally, we show that the remaining variance of the downstream task performance can be attributed to differences in generalization where fine-tuned models with the same training loss exhibit noticeably different test performance. Based on our analysis, we present a simple but strong baseline that makes fine-tuning BERT-based models significantly more stable than the previously proposed approaches.

The paper then introduces a simple suggested fix.\n\nPros:\n- The motivating problem is important: A large fraction of all computing time used on language-understanding tasks involves fine-tuning runs under the protocol studied here, and the problem of fine-tuning self-supervised models should be of broader interest at ICLR.\n- The proposed fix is simple and well-demonstrated. It consists of only an adjustment to the range of values considered in hyperparameter tuning (which is significant, since BERT and related papers *explicitly advise* users to use inappropriate values) and an adjustment to the implementation of the optimizer.\n\nCons:\n- The method is demonstrated on a relatively small set of difficult text-classification datasets, so the behavior studied here may be different in very different dataset size, task difficulty, or label entropy regimes.\n\nThis paper was divisive, so I gave it a fairly close look myself, and I'm persuaded by R1 and the other two positive reviewers: This is a classic example of a 'strong baselines paper', in that demonstrates that a more careful use of established methods can obviate the need for additional tricks.\n\nR3 raised two major concerns that they presented as potentially fatal, but that I find unpersuasive.\n- This paper studies stability in model performance, not stability in predictions on individual data points. R3 argues that the latter sense of stability is the more important problem. Stability is an ambiguous term in this context, and both versions of the problem are interesting. However, as the authors pointed out, the definition of stability that is used here is consistent with previous work, and is widely accepted to be a major practical problem in NLP. I don't think this is a weakness of this paper, rather, it's an opportunity for someone else to write another, different paper on a different problem.\n- R3 claims that the results are described as being more positive than they actually are, and the figure is potentially misleading. Looking at the quantitative results with R3's points in mind, I still see clear support for both of the paper's main suggestions. R3 opened up some potentially important questions about the handling of outliers in particular, but these questions were raised too late for the authors to be allowed to respond, and I don't see any evidence in the paper that anything improper was done. The marked outliers are clearly much farther from the mean/median in terms of standard deviations than the unmarked outliers.

In particular, it aims to demonstrate that previously identified reasons, catastrophic forgetting and small fine-tuning datasets, fail to explain the observed instability. Instead, it posits that the instability is caused by optimization difficulties that lead to vanishing gradients.\n\n################################ \n\nReasons for score:\n\nOverall, I lean toward accept. The underlying argument is simple and slightly advances a conversation about the underlying workings of BERT-based models while leaving substantial room for future exploration. This work would be strengthened by clarifying prescriptive guidance on the baseline recommended and experimentation on additional datasets.\n\n################################ \n\nStrengths:\n\n- Broad interest. BERT-based models have become prevalent in NLP due to their strong empirical performance. However, variation in fine-tuning hinders the consistency of the demonstrated gains. While existing hypotheses have been made, this work provides another point of evidence to advance the conversation around fine-tuning.\n\n- Presentation. The linearity of the argument is easy to follow and stylistic choices, e.g. the motivating question in the introduction, highlight the key aspects of this work. As a reader this is appreciated insofar as claims are stated unambiguously and then can be validated by the work that follows rather than intuited.\n\n################################ \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- Prescriptive baseline. The two guidelines in Section 6 are excellent, but as a reader I immediately wonder how these generalize to the datasets where I might apply BERT-based models. The guidelines of using a \"small learning rate with bias correction\" and \"increase the number of iterations\" are good, but can they be characterized in more detail? In other words, how can I make these (hopefully) generalizable insights concrete for future applications?\n\n- Additional datasets. While the existing datasets are sufficient for illustrating the arguments made, additional datasets would further support generalizable insights by providing additional points of evidence with respect to dataset size, and variance. This may support the point above regarding a characterization of large vs. small.\n\n################################ \n\nQuestions:\n\n- Is there any additional insight you can provide characterizing the baseline? If I were to apply these insights to a NLI dataset in another domain, e.g. MedNLI, could I expect these to hold?\n\n- While the aspects of pretraining and continual pretraining are explicitly deferred in the related works section, are there any insights you can provide about their impact on these findings for fine-tuning?\n\n\n################################ \n\nAfter response:\n\nThank you for the clarifications.

We discuss the two weaknesses (W1, W2) and the first question (Q1) together since they are very related, and then discuss the last question (Q2) about continual pretraining.\n\n**1. W1: Generalizable insights for the prescriptive baseline, W2: Testing additional datasets, Q1: Additional insights: If I were to apply these insights to a NLI dataset in another domain, e.g. MedNLI, could I expect these to hold?**\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn\u2019t run experiments on the MedNLI dataset based on its quite restricted access. However, to illustrate that our findings generalize to other datasets as well, we ran additional experiments on the SciTail dataset ([Khot et al. (2018)](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17368)). We choose SciTail because it's based on a corpus of scientific questions from school exams which makes it a different domain compared to the pre-training data used to train BERT.\n\nWe run the following experiments on SciTail: 1) we repeat the downsampling experiment shown in Fig. 3 of our paper and 2) we compare fine-tuning with the scheme of Devlin et al. (2019) to our proposed scheme. The results of the accuracy over 25 fine-tuning runs are shown below:\n\n| **Setup**      | **Mean** | **Std**     | **Max** |\n| ---        |    ----   |          --- |  --- |\n| Devlin et al. (2019), full train set, 3 epochs      | 95.1%       | 0.4%   | 96.0% |\n| Devlin et al. (2019), 1k points, 3 epochs      | 69.8%       | 17.9%   | 89.4% |\n| Devlin et al. (2019), 1k points, 71 epochs     | 87.5%       | 0.9%   | 89.1% |\n| Our fine-tuning scheme, full train set     | 95.1%       | 0.6%   | 96.8% |\n\nNote that due to its comparatively large size (28k training samples) fine-tuning on SciTail with the Devlin scheme is already very stable even when trained for 3 epochs. This is comparable to what we find for QNLI in our paper. \n\nWhen applying *our fine-tuning scheme* to SciTail, the results are very close to that of Devlin et al. (2019). On the other hand, for the downsampling experiment we can clearly see the same results as also observed in Fig. 3 for MRPC, CoLA, and QNLI, i.e. using more training iterations improves the fine-tuning stability. \n\nWe conclude from this experiment that our findings and guidelines generalize to datasets from other domains. This gives further evidence that the observed instability is not a property of *any particular* dataset but rather a result of too few training iterations based on the common fine-tuning practice of using a fixed number of *epochs* (and not *iterations*) independently of the training data size.\n\n**2. Q2: While the aspects of pretraining and continual pretraining are explicitly deferred in the related works section, are there any insights you can provide about their impact on these findings for fine-tuning?**\n\nWe will focus on the supervised intermediate/continual pre-training setting in our answer. \n\nOur findings regarding failure modes and instability also apply to the intermediate task fine-tuning itself. Moreover, it should be noted that intermediate task fine-tuning is typically done on large datasets, see e.g. [Pruksachatkun et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00628): 10 out of 11 of their intermediate fine-tuning tasks have more than 20k training samples. So we wouldn\u2019t expect to see large instabilities here. And if there would be instabilities, our proposed scheme would likely help to avoid them. \n\nAnother interesting aspect is what happens *after* the intermediate fine-tuning, i.e. how it affects the stability of fine-tuning on the downstream task. We\u2019d like to point again to [Pruksachatkun et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00628) in order to answer this question who find that *\u201cintermediate-task training reduces the likelihood of degenerate runs, leading to ostensibly positive transfer results on those four acceptability judgment tasks across most intermediate tasks.\u201d* \nAnd moreover: *\u201cextremely negative transfer from intermediate-task training can also result in a higher frequency of degenerate runs in downstream tasks, as we observe in the cases of using QQP and SocialIQA as intermediate tasks.\"*\n\nSo it seems that intermediate supervised fine-tuning can have both a positive and negative impact on downstream task fine-tuning. However, compared to our work it requires additional data. It would definitely be very interesting to study the influence of intermediate fine-tuning more closely in future work.\n\n\n", "title": "Response to R2"}, "hpe3B0IIfG1": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "IYAT-AwIR4Q", "comment": "We thank Reviewer 3 for the feedback. We would like to clarify in detail the main concern about the definition of fine-tuning stability that we use throughout the paper.\n\n**1. Our definition of fine-tuning stability follows the previous work.**\n* While [Dodge et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06305) do not directly define fine-tuning stability, they report and analyze the *standard deviation* of the validation performance (e.g., see Section 4.1 of their paper). \n* Along the same lines, an earlier work of [Phang et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01088) which studies the influence of intermediate fine-tuning, discusses the *variance* of the validation performance (see Section 4: Results, paragraph Fine-Tuning Stability therein) and plots the *standard deviation* over multiple random seeds in Figure 1.\n\n\n**2. The suggested definition of stability serves a different goal compared to what we aim to study.**\nWe would like to explain the main difference between our definition of stability and the suggested one. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume that the performance metric is *accuracy* and we have two classes (as, e.g., in RTE dataset). Let $A$ be a randomized fine-tuning algorithm that produces a classifier $f_A$, and denote data points as $(x, y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}$ where $\\mathcal{D}$ is the data-generating distribution.\n- **Our definition of stability:**\n$S_{ours}(A) = \\text{Var}_A \\left[ \\text{E}_\\{x, y\\} \\left[ \\mathbb{1}_\\{ f_A(x) = y\\} \\right] \\right] = \\text{Var}_A \\left[ \\text{Accuracy}(f_A)\\right],$\nThis definition directly measures the variance of the performance metric and aims to answer the question: *If we perform fine-tuning multiple times, how large the difference in the performance will be?* This is precisely the measure of stability we are interested in.\n- **Suggested definition of stability:**\nWe believe that the suggested definition can be formalized as follows:\n$S_{suggested}(A) = \\text{E}_\\{x, y\\} \\left[ \\text{Var}_A \\left[ \\mathbb{1}_\\{ f_A(x) = y\\} \\right] \\right].$\nThis definition also captures some notion of stability but different compared to the one we aim to study. Namely, it captures *per-point stability* by measuring how much the classifiers $f_A$ differ on the same point $x$ with respect to label $y$. Considering this question is *not* the goal of our study and the provided example from our perspective still leads to stable fine-tuning:\n\"*assume a fine-tuned model A has 50% accuracy on a binary classification task while model B's predictions are all opposite to model A's predictions, which also makes it a 50% accuracy model*\"\nSuch stability is obviously not very useful as we mention in Footnote 3 in our paper: *Some of the hyperparameter settings lead to a small fine-tuning variance where all runs lead to a performance below the majority baseline. Obviously, such fine-tuning stability is of limited use.*\n\n\n**3. \u201cBesides, the proposed improvement method is only using slightly different training hyperparameters\u201d**\n\nWe see the simplicity of the proposed method rather as an advantage. We think that if the stability problem can be addressed simply by changing some hyperparameters of the standard training scheme, then it can serve as a good baseline before introducing more complex methods. \n\nMoreover, we would like to emphasize that it is impractical to do a hyperparameter search over all possible hyperparameters as there are too many of them in a BERT-scale model. Particularly, because some hyperparameters like the bias correction of ADAM seem to have no influence in most cases so they are usually kept fixed. This highlights the importance of our analysis part in Section 5, which we view as an important contribution of our paper, where we first identified the problem and then proposed a solution *based on our analysis*.\n", "title": "Response to R3"}, "EQduW8tagj": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "QZZiAFdLpQ", "comment": "We thank Reviewer 4 for the useful feedback.

Hence, we think it is very important to obtain a better understanding of fine-tuning to be able to fix its failure cases and allow fair comparisons between different fine-tuning approaches.\n\n**2. \u201cI noted that the proposed fine-tuning guidelines are only evaluated using BERT, whereas the failure analyses apply also to RoBERTa and ALBERT. (Does that mean that ALBERT and RoBERTa benefit less from the proposed guidelines?)\u201d**\n\nRight, the failure analysis applies to RoBERTa and ALBERT as well, as can be seen in Figure 5. So it\u2019s not the case that our guidelines apply *only* to BERT. They do apply to RoBERTa and ALBERT as well.

(2019) fails for all runs. Our scheme however, results in successful fine-tuning for 21 out of 25 runs.

These can, however, be easily fixed when decreasing the initial learning rate as our failure analysis in Figure. 5 shows.\n\n**3. \u201cI'm not sure that I like this sentence though - \"there is no clear motivation for why preserving the original masked language modeling performance after fine-tuning is important\". This obviously depends on the task. The end task could involve slot-filling for example, with fine-tuning used for domain adaptation.\u201d**\n\nFor the setting which we study in the paper: fine-tuning for sentence-level classification we believe that our statement holds true. There is no general motivation for why we should preserve the MLM capabilities of the model. \n\nHowever, we agree that for other end-tasks like slot-filling, the MLM capabilities of the model are still important. We think it can also be important in some other scenarios like intermediate fine-tuning to perform domain adaptation.

The reasons of such instability were assumed to be catastrophic forgetting and the small size of datasets on which being fine-tuned in previous literature. The authors conduct experiments on several sub tasks of GLUE in an attempt to show the aforementioned two assumptions cannot explain the instability of fine-tuning. Instead they claim that the real reasons are gradient vanishing and the lack of generalization and subsequently propose a set of training hyperparameters to improve the stability.\n\n### Pros\n\nThe analysis of the impact of dataset size is designed clear and concise, which shows it is the number of iterations that really matters rather than the size of datasets. This conclusion is valuable for the audience.\n\nThe suggestions of training hyperparameters provided at the end of the paper is somewhat useful for future researchers.\n\n### Cons\n\nThe authors define term \"stability\" by \"the std of fine-tuning performance (acc, F1, MCC), the lower the better\". This metric is too curtness to precisely represent the real stability. A very simple counter example: assume a fine-tuned model A has 50% accuracy on a binary classification task while model B's predictions are all opposite to model A's predictions, which also makes it a 50% accuracy model. These two models obviously show the most instable situation that they disagree on every single sample. While the std of performance is 0, which by the definition of the authors it is the most stable case. The correct practice is to measure how much it changes on the prediction of the same input between different models.\n\nSince the definition is very important and used through the whole analysis, the fact that it is defined too rough makes the following conclusions in the paper not convincible enough.\n\nBesides, the proposed improvement method is only using slightly different training hyperparameters, which is possible to be covered by a simple grid-search of hyperparameters and therefore cannot be seen as a big contribution.\n", "title": "Reviews and Comments", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}}}
