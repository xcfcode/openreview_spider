This is due to the difficulty of estimating the phase of clean speech. To improve speech enhancement performance, we tackle the phase estimation problem in three ways. First, we propose Deep Complex U-Net, an advanced U-Net structured model incorporating well-defined complex-valued building blocks to deal with complex-valued spectrograms. Second, we propose a polar coordinate-wise complex-valued masking method to reflect the distribution of complex ideal ratio masks. Third, we define a novel loss function, weighted source-to-distortion ratio (wSDR) loss, which is designed to directly correlate with a quantitative evaluation measure. Our model was evaluated on a mixture of the Voice Bank corpus and DEMAND database, which has been widely used by many deep learning models for speech enhancement. Ablation experiments were conducted on the mixed dataset showing that all three proposed approaches are empirically valid. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in all metrics, outperforming previous approaches by a large margin.", "keywords": ["speech enhancement", "deep learning", "complex neural networks", "phase estimation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The authors propose an algorithm for enhancing noisy speech by also accounting for the phase information. This is done by adapting UNets to handle features defined in the complex space, and by adapting the loss function to improve an appropriate evaluation metric.\n\nStrengths\n- Modifies existing techniques well to better suit the domain for which the algorithm is being proposed. Modifications like extending UNet to complex Unet to deal with phase, redefining the mask and loss are all interesting improvements.\n- Extensive results and analysis.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The work is centered around speech enhancement, and hence has limited focus. \n\nEven though the paper is limited to speech enhancement, the reviewers agreed that the contributions made by the paper are significant and can help improve related applications like ASR.

However, in addition to the modification, our main contributions include a novel masking approach and an advanced loss function design.

Since the perceptual quality of hyperbolic tangent compression was not good compared to the other masking methods, we did not add the results in our manuscript. However, as you suggested, we think it is fair to have the actual quantitative results to compare, and thus we are currently retraining the network using hyperbolic tangent compression and will report the result as soon as the training finishes.\n\n\nApart from the objective metrics, a human listening test using MOS or preference score should be conducted.\n-> Answer:\nThank you for your suggestion.

Some people use SDR as a speech enhancement measure, and I\u2019m expecting that this method can have more reasonable performance since it is optimized based on wSDR.\n-> Answer:\nFor quick comparison, we evaluated SDR for DCUnet-20 with the BDT mask setting, and obtained the following results:\n\t       Spc      Wav     wSDR\nSDR      23.17 | 23.99 | 24.16\nSSNR     9.54  | 12.34 | 13.29 \nAs expected, wSDR yielded the best performance among the three loss terms compared in the paper.\nHowever, we would like to note that SDR is essentially scale-invariant SNR, and since wSDR loss tries to fit the scale of the target source, it leads to maximizing SNR (not scale-invariant) more than maximizing SDR. This can be confirmed by the fact that more dramatic improvement is observed in terms of SSNR rather than SDR.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer#2"}, "SyxRGSbR37": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkeRTsAcYm", "review": "The paper is written, provides good description of the state-of-the-art and comprehensive experimental results.\nThe methological contribution is mild, essentially changing a buiding block in a state-of-the-art neural architecture.\nThe paper is for the expert audience mostly and is difficult to grasp without a good background on deep learning for speech enhancement.\n", "title": "well written & rather experimental paper -- for the experts mostly", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "HylyWCnnnm": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkeRTsAcYm", "review": "This paper tackles one of important speech enhancement issues of how to predict phase information.
