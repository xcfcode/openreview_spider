The goal is to meta-learn updates that are optimal with respect to transitions between pairs of tasks, allowing for few-shot execution time adaptation that does not degrade as the environment diverges ever further from the training time task set.\n\nDuring learning, an inner loop iterates iterates over consecutive task pairs. For each pair, (T_i, T_{i+1}) trajectories sampled from T_i are used to construct a local policy that is then used to sample trajectories from T_{i+1}. By calculating the outer-loop policy gradient with respect to expectations of the trajectories sampled from T_i, and the trajectories sampled from T_{i+1} using the locally optimal inner-loop policy, the approach learns updates that are optimal with respect to the Markovian transitions between pairs of consecutive tasks.\n\nThe training time optimization algorithm requires multiple passes through a given sequence of tasks. Since this is not feasible at execution time, the trajectories calculated while solving task T_i are used to calculate updates for task T_{i+1} and these updates are importance weighted w.r.t the sampled trajectories' expectation under the final training-time policy.\n\nThe approach is evaluated on a pair of tasks. In the locomotion task, a six legged agent has to adapt to deal with an increasing inhibition to a pair of its legs. In the new RoboSumo task, agents have to adapt to effectively compete with increasingly competent components, that have been trained for longer periods of time via self-play.\n\nIt is clear that, in the locomotion task, the meta learning strategy maintains performance much more consistently than approaches that adapt through PPO-tracking, or implicitly by maintaining state in the RL^2 approach. This behaviour is less visible in the RoboSumo task (Fig 5.) but it does seem to present. Further experiments show that when the adaptation approaches are forced to fight against each other in 100 round iterated adaptation games, the meta learning strategy is dominant. However, the authors also do point out that this behaviour is highly dependent on the number of episodes allowed in each game, and when the agent can accumulate a large amount of evidence in a given environment the meta learning approach falls behind adaptation through tracking. The bias that allows the agent to learn effectively from few examples precludes it from effectively using many examples.\n\n---- Questions for author ----\nUpdates are performed from \\theta to \\phi_{i+1} rather than from \\phi_i to \\phi_{i+1}. Footnote 2 states that this was due to empirical observations of instability but it also necessitates the importance weight correction during execution time. I would like to know how the authors expect the sample in Eqn 9 to behave in much longer running scenarios, when \\pi_{\\phi} starts to diverge drastically from \\pi_{\\theta} but very few trajectories are available.\n\nThe spider-spider results in Fig. 6 do not support the argument that meta learning is better than PPO tracking in the few-shot regime. Do you have any idea of why this is?\n\n---- Nits ----\nThere is a slight muddiness of notation around the use of \\tau in lines 7 & 9 in  of Algorithm 1. I think it should be edited to line up with the definition given in Eqn. 8. \n\nThe figures in this paper depend excessively and unnecessarily on color. They should be made more printer, and colorblind, friendly.\n\n---- Conclusion ----\nI think this paper would be a very worthy contribution to ICLR. Learning to adapt on the basis of few observations is an important prerequisite for real world agents, and this paper presents a reasonable approach backed up by a suite of informative evaluations. The quality of the writing is high, and the contributions are significant. However, this topic is very much outside of my realm of expertise and I am unfamiliar with the related work, so I am assigning my review a low confidence.", "title": "This is a strong paper presenting a novel approach to few-shot eval-time adaptation in non-stationary environments, supported by multiple analyses in two synthetic domains.

We answer the questions below:\n\nRelated work:\nWe agree that continuous adaptation is indeed a variation of continual learning. The updated version of the paper now points this out.\n\nTerminology:\nThank you for suggestions. We have improved our terminology and notation throughout the paper, explicitly named the meta-loss, and renamed the inner loop gradient update (as given in Eq. 2) from \u201cmeta-update\u201d to \u201cadaptation update\u201d.\n\nNotation:\nInitially, \\mathcal{R}_T was standing for the risk (i.e., the expected loss, as commonly used in machine learning literature). This notation was indeed a bit confusing in the RL context where R is often used for rewards, so we have altered it.\n\nImportance sampling:\nGood point. Eq. 9 gives a general form of the estimator for \\phi. In practice, the adaptation gradient (i.e., the gradient of L_{T_{i-1}} as now given in Eq. 9) decouples into a sum over time steps, so we compute importance weights for each time step (i.e., for each action) separately.

We answer the questions below:\n\n1. Good point, the estimator in Eq. 9 may cause high variance in \\phi. Three points to note:\n(i) We used importance weight correction only at execution time (indeed, the variance of the estimator hindered learning in such a regime; see footnote 2).\n(ii) Even though Eq. 9 shows the sum over K episodes, each episode consists of multiple time steps (typically 100-500 time steps, depending on the experiment) each of which is treated as a separate sample and gets an importance weight. Even with a limited number of episodes, we get quite a substantial number of time steps (with 3 episodes of 500 steps each, we get 1,500 time steps). In our experiments, the effective sample size was always reasonable (more than 20%), which worked at execution time (but not for learning).\n(iii) To compute adaptation updates using Eq. 9 in practice, meta-learners not only used the immediate past episode, but multiple previous episodes (see section 5.1, paragraph 2), which increased the number of samples and further helped to reduce the variance of the estimator.\n\n2. No, the method is not designed to work in the regime with no mutual information between T_i and T_{i+1}. Our meta-learning approach targets to solve a zero-shot problem (i.e., do well at T_{i+1} without previous interaction experience with that particular task) knowing that tasks are sequentially dependent. If the tasks are independent, having some initial interaction with each new task is perhaps the only way to solve the problem.\n\n3. In our setup, the number of episodes after which the environment/opponent changes is fixed. Moreover, we assume that the agent knows a priori the number of episodes or rounds after which the environment or opponent changes. This information is directly used by RL^2.", "title": "Thank you"}, "B1YwMwHmf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SyK4pmsgG", "comment": "Thank you for carefully reading the paper and thoughtful questions. We have improved the notation and the color-coding in the figures. We answer the questions below:\n\n- When \\pi_{\\phi} significantly diverges from \\pi_{\\theta}, the estimate given Eq. 9 would become of very high variance. In our setup, \\pi_{\\phi} was always at most a few gradient steps away from \\pi_{\\theta} in the parameter space. This gave difference in behaviors while keeping the effective sample size reasonable (always more than 20%). Much longer running scenarios may require a better estimator (i.e., of lower variance) which should also take into account the sequential structure of the tasks (e.g., a particle filter).\n\n- Good point, different methods yielded similar performance in the spider-spider experiments. This is because the agents tended to learn very similar behaviors regardless of the algorithm. The spectrum of behaviors learned by the agent highly depends on the morphology. From videos, we noticed that spiders always picked up a very particular fighting style, using front legs to kick the opponent and back legs to stabilize the posture, and never altered it during adaptation. This could be due to, perhaps, optimality of such behavior, but we did not further quantify this effect.\n", "title": "Thank you"}, "HyyfMDSQf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Sk2u1g-0-", "comment": "We thank reviewers for their time and thoughtful feedback.\n\nWe have updated the submission: improved notation throughout the paper, resolved ambiguities, and improved color-coding in the plots.
