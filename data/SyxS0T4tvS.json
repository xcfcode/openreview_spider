Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE, SQuAD, SuperGLUE and XNLI. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.", "keywords": ["Deep learning", "language representation learning", "natural language understanding"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper conducts an extensive study of training BERT and shows that its performance can be improved significantly by choosing a better training setup (e.g., hyperparameters, objective functions). I think this paper clearly offers a better understanding of the importance of tuning a language model to get the best performance on downstream tasks. However, most of the findings are obvious (careful tuning helps, more data helps). I think the novelty and technical contributions are rather limited for a conference such as ICLR. These concerns are also shared by all the reviewers. The review scores are borderline, so I recommend to reject the paper."}, "review": {"H1eX3xCFir": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SyxS0T4tvS", "comment": "We thank the three reviewers for their helpful comments.

Regarding our use of a smaller beta2, good catch. This is primarily to improve stability when training with *larger learning rates*, but is not directly related to batch size. We will correct and clarify this in an updated version of the paper.\n\nRe: \u201cfull-sentences\u201d and \u201cdoc-sentences\u201d input formats, the primary motivation was to remove the NSP loss. The tradeoffs between these two input formats relate to efficiency and potential noise from input segments that span multiple documents. The \u201cfull-sentences\u201d format samples sentences contiguously from the corpus, but inputs may cross document boundaries and thus the inputs are slightly noisier \u2014 a similar noise occurs with NSP when sampling negative samples from distinct documents. \u201cdoc-sentences\u201d inputs can only come from a single document and thus does not contain cross-document noise. However, to maintain efficiency the doc-sentences format requires us to use a dynamic batch size that makes it more difficult to compare to other work. We will clarify this and add additional discussion around these points.\n\nRe: NSP loss, we\u2019re not able to observe any clear qualitative differences, and even quantitative differences are very small. Indeed, one of our contributions is showing that the NSP loss does not have a meaningful effect on downstream task performance, thus we remove it.\n\nRe: overfitting, we observed that the validation loss continued to decrease even for our longest-trained model, suggesting that it may benefit from even longer training. We will clarify this.\n", "title": "Thank you for your review"}, "Hyebye0FsS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Byx4-_ZZcS", "comment": "Thank you for your review. Regarding the sensitivity of pretraining to the AdamW epsilon term, we note that our setting (1e-6) matches that of the original BERT paper. While most deep learning platforms use a default value of eps=1e-8, we found that BERT would often fail to train with eps=1e-8 or 1e-7, especially for the larger models. An epsilon of 1e-6 was the smallest value that worked consistently, so we added a remark about sensitivity to this hyperparameter in case it was helpful for others. We will clarify this in an updated version of the paper.\n\nRegarding multi-task finetuning, the focus of our work was primarily to evaluate the importance of various design decisions in the BERT pretraining phase. While multi-task finetuning is often effective (and is itself an active area of research), we feel that it goes beyond the scope of our paper which focuses primarily on pretraining. We agree it is worth studying in future work.

Overall, the paper is very well-written and the experimental setups are reasonable and thoroughly presented that would benefit the community for future research and exploration.

It shows that BERT was significantly undertrained and propose an improved training recipe called RoBERTa. The key ideas are: (i) training longer with bigger batches over more data, (ii) removing NSP, (iii) training over long sequences, and (iv) dynamically changing the masking pattern. The proposed RoBERTa achieves/matches state-of-the-art performance on many standard NLU downstream tasks. \n\nThe in-depth experimental analysis of the BERT pretraining process in this paper answers many open questions (e.g., the usefulness of NSP objective) and also provide some guidance in how to effectively tweak the performance of pretrained model (e.g., large batch size). It also further demonstrates that the BERT model, once fully tuned, could achieve SOTA/competitive performance compared to the recent new models (e.g., XLNet). The main weakness of the paper is that it is mainly based on further tuning the existing BERT model and lacks novel contribution in model architecture. However, the BERT analysis results provided in this paper should also be valuable to the community. \n\nQuestions & Comments:\n\u2022\tIt is stated that the performance is sensitive to epsilon in AdamW. This reminds us of the sensitivity of BERT pretraining to the optimizers. Since one of the main contributions of this paper is the analysis of the BERT pretraining process, more experimental analysis on the optimizer should also be included.\n\u2022\tIt is stated that (page 7) the submission to GLUE leaderboard uses only single-task finetuning. Is there any special reason for restraining it to single-task finetuning if earlier results demonstrates multi-task finetuning is better? Of course, it is valuable to see the great performance achieved by single-task finetuning for RoBERTa. But there should be no reason that it is restricted to be so. An additional experimental results with multi-task finetuning should also be added.\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 4}, "ByeB-Xqatr": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SyxS0T4tvS", "review": "This paper is a replication study of BERT for training large language models. Its main modification is simple: training longer with more data. Significantly improvements have been reported, and the work achieves on-par or higher accuracy over a large set of downstream tasks compared to XLNet, which is a state-of-the-art autoregressive language model. \n\nPros:\n+ The paper incorporates robust optimization into BERT training with more data, and shows that together it significantly improves BERT's performance on downstream tasks.\n+ The experimental results show that RoBERTa can significantly advance the baseline BERT model and achieve on-par or new state-of-the-art accuracy on a large range of downstream tasks.\n\nCons:\n- While the replication study is well appreciated, the novelty contribution of the paper is marginally incremental as the model structure is largely unchanged from BERT. The other techniques applied also are somewhat trivial.\n- Very little can be deduced from the experiments, as performance is often improved by training over more data. \n\nOverall, I believe this paper comes at the right time and is addressing an interesting problem. The paper is well-organized and well-written. The contribution of the paper comes mostly from carefully taking into account several additional design choices and show that they could help train BERT with more data and can achieve SoTA performance on downstream tasks. Those modifications can be summarized as: (1) large-batch training with batch size 8k; (2) no mixed sequence length training only used 512 for the entire run; (3) no next sentence prediction; (4) dynamic masking instead of static; (5) larger byte-level BPE vocab (which increases BERT-large size by 20M parameters). Although they are interesting, a major concern is that it is difficult to find one thing that would have catapulted it over others to ensure publication.\n\nQuestion:\nDo you plan to release the datasets used for training in this work?", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 2}}}
