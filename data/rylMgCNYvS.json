Recent work has suggested that some strong-performing recurrent neural networks utilize their memory as counters. Thus, one potential way to understand the sucess of these networks is to revisit the theory of counter computation. Therefore, we choose to study the abilities of real-time counter machines as formal grammars. We first show that several variants of the counter machine converge to express the same class of formal languages. We also prove that counter languages are closed under complement, union, intersection, and many other common set operations. Next, we show that counter machines cannot evaluate boolean expressions, even though they can weakly validate their syntax. This has implications for the interpretability and evaluation of neural network systems: successfully matching syntactic patterns does not guarantee that a counter-like model accurately represents underlying semantic structures. Finally, we consider the question of whether counter languages are semilinear. This work makes general contributions to the theory of formal languages that are of particular interest for the interpretability of recurrent neural networks.", "keywords": ["formal language theory", "counter automata", "natural language processing", "deep learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper presents an analysis of the languages that can be accepted by a counter machine, motivated by recent work that suggests that counter machines might be a good formal model from which to approach the analysis of LSTM representations.\n\nThis is one of the trickiest papers in my batch. Reviewers agree that it represents an interesting and provocative direction, and I suspect that it could yield valuable discussion at the conference. However, reviewers were not convinced that the claims made (or implied) _about LSTMs_ are motivated, given the imperfect analogy between them and counter machines. The authors promise some empirical evidence that might mitigate these concerns to some extent, but the paper has not yet been updated, so I cannot take that into account. \n\nAs a very secondary point, which is only relevant because this paper is borderline, LSTMs are no longer widely used for language tasks, so discussion about the capacity of LSTMs _for language_ seems like an imperfect fit for an machine learning conference with a fairly applied bent."}, "review": {"H1lJmdngsB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SylMDPRYcr", "comment": "Thank you for acknowledging the improvements in our work, and for both rounds of reviews that you have now given us. We found the SCiL reviews extremely helpful for clarifying our arguments as well as the presentation of the proofs. If accepted, we will double-check the SCiL reviews in addition to these ones in order to incorporate feedback that we might have missed.\n\nIn 1), we appreciate your point that the major question raised by our paper is a \u201cvery strong starting point for further exploration.\u201d Along these lines, we have recently conducted some formal language experiments with LSTMs that we plan to include in a revised version. The results suggest that, empirically, learning how to evaluate boolean expressions is harder than learning to validate whether they are well-formed. We hope this makes the connection to neural networks more direct and provides a concrete starting point for future work.\n\nIn 2), your suggestion to include an example illustrating the mechanics of counter machines is well taken. If accepted, we will add such a figure.\n\nFor 3), you are right that a^{2^n} and {ww | w \\in \\Sigma^*} cannot be modeled by real-time counter automata, by similar arguments to Theorem 5.1 (boolean evaluation). We will incorporate these facts (as well as discussion of the related grammar formalisms) as a further illustration of their theoretical weakness, and possibly shorten the discussion of semilinearity. Thank you for the references.\n\nFinally, to answer your question about variation in definitions:\n\nFischer et al. 1968 primarily focus on the non-real-time counter machines, where you can have multiple state transitions per input. Because of this, they allow a second class of states Q_a that does not consume input. If you constrain their machine to be real-time, then each state transition must consume input, so Q_a becomes unneeded, and you are left with the definition that we and Weiss et al. (2018) use.

In our conclusion, we suggest that a similar mismatch between syntax/semantics might affect LSTMs, due to the theory in the literature that LSTM memory is structured as counter registers. We intentionally word this take-away tentatively. While tentative, we believe it is still valuable, much in line with AnonReviewer6\u2019s comment: \u201cIf, however, this conjecture should turn out to be true, the paper would mark a very strong starting point for further exploration.\u201d We are open to rephrasing the conclusion to emphasize its tentative nature, and that it makes predictions that future work can readily test.\n\nIn light of your comments, it seems that we should clarify our discussion of why previous work motivates a connection between counter languages and the practical learnable capacity of LSTMs.\n\nAs you say, there are papers showing \u201chow to build semantic or syntactic structures using LSTMs\u201d, but as discussed by Weiss et al. (2018) and Merrill (2019), it is not clear that gradient descent has the ability or inductive bias to reach these rigid strategies. This idea is central to the line of work that we reference in the introduction.\n\nMany works present theoretical and empirical evidence relating the behavior learnable by LSTMs to computation with counters. These include the visualization of LSTM states as counter registers (Weiss, 2018; Suzgun 2019) and empirical results showing that LSTMs fail to generalize on tasks beyond the counter languages (Hao et al., 2018; Merrill, 2019; Suzgun et al., 2019). There are also theoretical lower bound (Weiss et al., 2018) and upper bound (Merrill et al., 2019) results for asymptotic LSTMs. These results do not provably establish equivalence, but they provide a reason for thinking that studying counter automata might shed light on LSTMs.\n", "title": "Author Response"}, "B1lBSFneiH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkgskIy2YB", "comment": "Thank you for your review.

The authors does some proves on counter automata and hopes to gain insights into the properties of LSTMs used for NLP or semantic analysis and this would provide insights for the use in NLP.

That one can use LSTMs to compute languages that counter automata can do too means not that they could do more.

This is motivated by recent indications that LSTMs have comparable expressivity to counter machines, so that the formal properties of these machines might provide indirect insights into the linguistic suitability of LSTMs.\n\n\nEvaluation\n----------\n\nI also reviewed this paper for SCiL a few months ago.\nWhile I had major reservations back then, I am happy to provide a more positive evaluation this time as the authors have done some revisions that clear up many points of confusion.\nI have to add two caveats, though.\nFirst, I am a bit disheartened that the authors chose not to adopt many of the excellent changes suggested by another SCiL reviewer (who went way beyond the call of duty with their multi-page review).\nSecond, I did not have sufficient time to check all proofs for their correctness.\nIn many cases the strategies strike me as intuitively sound, but my intuition tends to miss edge cases.\nNonetheless, I think that this paper, albeit a bit of a gamble, would make for an interesting addition to the program.\n\n\n1) Weakness: Link to neural networks still unclear\n\nThe central weakness of the paper is still the link between neural networks and counter automata.\nBased on what is said in the paper, this is merely a conjecture at this point, not a well-established fact. \nWithout this link, the value of the paper is unclear.\nIf, however, this conjecture should turn out to be true, the paper would mark a very strong starting point for further exploration.\nThis makes it a gamble worth taking.\n\n\n2) Strong results, but lack of examples\n\nThe results are not trivial and provide deep insights into the inner workings of counter machines.\nIn particular the fact that counter machines cannot correctly represent Boolean expressions reveals key limitations on their representational power.\nThe semilinearity result is less impressive because of how limited the machines are that it applies to, and I'm not sure that the proof provides a good basis for generalization to more complex machines.\nThe authors might consider removing this part to clear some space for examples, which are sorely needed.\nThe formalism is abstract and unfamiliar to most readers, and a few concrete examples would greatly strengthen the readers' intuition.\n\n\n3) No investigation of linguistically important string languages\n\nAs the authors make claims about linguistic adequacy, it is surprising that there is no discussion of TALs, MCFLs or PMCLFs.\nThe grammar formalism of GPSG was abandoned because it was limited to context-free languages and could not handle those more complex language classes.\nSo if counter machines fail here, the issue of their linguistic adequacy is already decided without further probing semilinearity or representational power.\nAs far as I can tell, real-time counter machines cannot generate the PMCLF a^{2^n}, which is an abstract model of unbounded copying constructions in natural language (see Radzisnky on Chinese number names, Michaelis & Kracht on Old Georgian case stacking, and Kobele on Yoruba).\nNor is it obvious to me that counter machines can handle the copy language {ww | w \\in \\Sigma^*}, a model of crossing dependencies, although they can handle a^n b^n c^n (a TAL).\nIt should also be possible to generate the linguistically undesirable MIX language, which is a 2-MCFL but not a TAL.\n\n\nMinor comments\n--------------\n\n- As noted in my SCiL review, your definitions still differ from those of Fischer et al. 1968. What is the reason for this?\n\n- Theorem 3.1: \\subsetneq would be clearer than \\subset\n\n- p4, typo: the the\n\n- Proof of Theorem 3.2: Unless I misunderstand your modulo construction, your ICL only has resolution up to mod n. For instance, with mod 2 it can distinguish 2 from 3, but not 2 from 4. The CL can do that. Don't you need a second counter c_i' for each c_i, then, to keep track of how often you have wrapped around modulo n in c_i? That would still be incremental as you can never wrap around by more than 1 in any given update.\n\n- Sec 6.1: in all those definitions, if should be iff\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n@ARTICLE{Radzinski91,\n  author = {Radzinski, Daniel},\n  title = {Chinese Number Names, Tree Adjoining Languages, and Mild Context\n\tSensitivity},\n  year = {1991},\n  journal = {Computational Linguistics},\n  volume = {17},\n  pages = {277--300},\n  url = {http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/acl/J/J91/J91-3002.pdf}\n}\n\n@INPROCEEDINGS{MichaelisKracht97,\n  author = {Michaelis, Jens and Kracht, Marcus},\n  title = {Semilinearity as a Syntactic Invariant},\n  year = {1997},\n  booktitle = {Logical Aspects of Computational Linguistics},\n  pages = {329--345},\n  editor = {Retor{\\'e}, Christian},\n  volume = {1328},\n  series = {Lecture Notes in Artifical Intelligence},\n  publisher = {Springer},\n  doi = {10.1007/BFb0052165},\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BFb0052165}\n}\n\n@PHDTHESIS{Kobele06,\n  author = {Kobele, Gregory M.},\n  title = {Generating Copies: {A}n Investigation into Structural Identity in\n\tLanguage and Grammar},\n  year = {2006},\n  school = {UCLA},\n  url = {http://home.uchicago.edu/~gkobele/files/Kobele06GeneratingCopies.pdf}\n}", "title": "Official Blind Review #6", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 2}}}
