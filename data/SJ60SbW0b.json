Despite many empirical successes, we lack the ability to clearly understand and interpret the learned mechanisms that contribute to such effective behaviors and more critically, failure modes. In this work, we present a general method for visualizing an arbitrary neural network's inner mechanisms and their power and limitations. Our dataset-centric method produces visualizations of how a trained network attends to components of its inputs. The computed \"attention masks\" support improved interpretability by highlighting which input attributes are critical in determining output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a variety of deep neural network architectures in domains from computer vision and natural language processing. The primary contribution of our approach is an interpretable visualization of attention that provides unique insights into the network's underlying decision-making process irrespective of the data modality.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "neural network", "attention", "attention mechanism", "interpretability", "visualization"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The proposed LAN provides a visualization of the selectivity of networks to its inputs.

To this end, the paper propose a novel training objective that can learn to tell the importance of each dimension of input. It is very interesting. However, one question is what is the potential usage of the model? Since the model need to train an another network to visualize the structure of a trained neural network, it is expensive, and I don't think the model can help use to design a better structure (at least the experiments did not show this point). And maybe different structures of LAN will produce different understanding of the trained model. Hence people are still not sure what kind of structure is the most helpful.", "title": "This paper presented a general method for visualizing an arbitrary neural network's inner mechanisms.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "Sk3pyHoez": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SJ60SbW0b", "review": "The authors of this paper proposed a data-driven black-box visualization scheme.

Generated masks are helpful to interpret the preferred patterns of neural networks as well as diagnose modes of error.\n\nThe paper is very well motivated and the formulation and experiments are well presented too.

Consider a neural network that must make inferences in the healthcare domain, potentially having direct and immediate consequence to patients. When such a network makes any inference, it is paramount that there is an understanding of *why*. Identifying life-threatening illnesses or selecting an optimal course of treatment are just a few examples of decisions that must be made with as much transparency as possible. In capturing the importance in each dimension of a network\u2019s input, our attention masks are a step forward in this direction of interpretable and understandable models. Please consult Section G of our supplementary materials for a demonstration of how sample-specific attention masks successfully identify model failure modes.\n\nWith regards to the cost of a LAN, we note that the training time is itself a sunk cost that offers the potential of yielding information about a potentially erroneous model. In our work, we outline  two methods for learning attention masks. While one prescribes an entirely new network to train a mapping from input to attention masks, the other simply learns the attention mask for a single input directly. While we make no claims on the ability for a LAN to deliver a novel architecture that could remedy the problems of an existing network, it can certainly identify failure points from the dataset and provide sufficient motivation for abandoning an existing network architecture.\n\nSince the training objective would remain unchanged, we currently do not believe that using different structures for the LAN will result in significantly different attention masks. That said, the prohibitive cost of searching over the space of possible LAN architectures is, in part, mitigated by our second \u201csample-specific\u201d approach for learning attention masks directly without constructing an entirely new network. \n", "title": "Usage and Cost of Modeling Latent Attention"}, "rJakzaEmM": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HkkF8qngG", "comment": "Before directly addressing their concerns, we direct the reviewer\u2019s attention to the newly added Sections E, F, & G in the supplementary material of our revised paper draft.

LANs trained with an insufficiently large value of beta would accurately reproduce F network outputs without providing useful attention masks; conversely, overly large values of beta dismiss too much information in the input and make reproducing the original network outputs incredibly difficult. Fortunately, since our approach does not require the re-training of the original network altogether, the grid search over potential beta values is relatively simple, though results must be evaluated qualitatively. Please refer to Section E of the supplementary material for some visualizations illustrating the effect of beta on the resulting attention masks. Accordingly, a fruitful direction for subsequent research involves identifying metrics or alternate loss functions that can better measure the interpretability of the resulting masks thereby minimizing the amount of manual inspection needed to diagnose pre-trained models within our framework.\n", "title": "Role of the Beta Hyperparameter"}}}
