However, we do not quite understand how the prior can be interpreted as log-uniform. The log term only comes from the KL divergence instead of the prior. Or maybe you are talking about a different interpretation using the Chernoff bound instead?\n\n\nQ: The paper ignores the possibility that the prior should be centered at\nthe random initialization of the parameters.  This was found to be\nessential in Dziugaite and Roy and completely changes the dependence\nof k_i on w_i.\n\nA: Thanks for the great suggestion. We agree that there is no particular reason the prior should be zero centered. Trying priors with non-zero mean is definitely something to be investigated in future. Still one can get reasonable bound even with zero-centered priors. For example, Neyshabur et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09564) also use priors with zero mean in their spectral norm bound for neural network. \n\n\nQ: Another complaint is that the Hoefding bound is very loose in cases\nwhere the emperical loss is small compared to its upper bound.  The\nanalysis can be more intuitively related to practice by avoiding the\nrescaling of the loss into the interval [0,1] and writing expressions\nin terms of a maximum bound on the loss L_max.  When hat{L} << L_max\n(almost always the case in practice) the relative Chernoff bound is\nmuch tighter and significantly alters the analysis.  See McAllester's\nPAC-Bayesian tutorial.\n\nA: Thanks very much for the insightful suggestion. Actually Chernoff bound may lead to even cleaner solutions compared to the Hoeffding bound. We plan to investigate this further in future work. \n\n\nQ: The theoretical discussion on re-parameterization misses an important\npoint, in my opinoin, relative to the need to impose a learning bias\n(the no-free-lunch theorem).  All L_2 generalization bounds can be\ninterpreted in terms of a Gaussian prior on the parameters.  In all\nsuch cases the prior (the learning bias) is not invariant to\nre-parameterization.  All L_2 generalization bounds are subject to the\nsame re-parameterization criticism.  A prior tied to a particular\nparameterization is standard practice in machine learning for in all\nL_2 generalization bounds, including SVMs.  I do think that a\nlog-uniform prior (rather than a Gaussian prior) is superior and\ngreatly reduces sensitivity to re-parameterization as noted by the\nauthors (extremely indirectly).\n\nA: We agree. Originally, the PAC-Bayes bound talks about priors over the function space instead of the parameter space. In that case, the bound is invariant to reparameterization. Unfortunately, for ease of theoretical analysis, the prior is typically imposed on the parameter space which results in said issues. \n\n\nQ: I did not find the empirical results to very useful.  The value of\nparameter perturbation in training remains an open question. Although\nit is rarely done in practice today, it is an important fundamental\nquestion. A much more thorough investigation is needed before any\nconclusions can be drawn with confidence. Experimentation with\nperturbation methods would seem more informative than theory given the\ncurrent state of the art in relating theory to practice.\n\nA: As suggested by you and reviewer 2, we have added some comparisons with the dropout method. In particular, we tried dropout with values 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 and found that the perturbation analysis still yields better performance.

PAC-Bayes bounds. \n\nA: While it is true that we are inspired by Neyshabur et al.\u2019s great work, we respectfully disagree and emphasize that the extension is not trivial:\n\n1. This is the first work connecting the local Hessian with the model generalization rigorously. There was no detailed quantitative analysis on how the Hessian and high-order smoothness terms could be integrated in the model generalization in Neyshabur et al.\u2019s work.\n\n2. Naively extending Neyshabur\u2019s PAC-Bayes bounds wouldn\u2019t give a closed-form solution for the perturbation levels since the bound they use has a square-root dependency on the KL-divergence. Instead, we handle the issue by starting from the PAC-Hoeffding bound with one additional dependency on \\eta. The dependency on \\eta is removed in Theorem 2 after the \u201coptimal\u201d perturbation level is solved by using the union bound over a grid of \\eta.\n\n\nQ: Many quantities track the generalization error (see some of Bartlett\u2019s, Srebro\u2019s, Arora\u2019s work). \n\nA: Yes, Barlett, Srebro, and Arora have amazing work to bound the generalization errors, but none of them explains how the local Hessian and smoothness terms can be related, in general, to model generalization. \n\n\nQ: In fact, these other quantities track it more accurately.  Or why not to show that it at least tracks the generalization error better than other quantities?\n\nA: These other quantities may or may not track the generalization more accurately depending on different scenarios. \nBartlett\u2019s and Srebro\u2019s bounds contain the product of the norms of the coefficients, while our bound is more related to the local smoothness terms such as the neighborhood \\kappa, Hessian and the Lipschitz constant of Hessian. \nAn ideal case for our bound is when the loss function is flat over a large neighborhood around w^*. In this case the gap between the empirical loss and the population loss in our bound is about \\sqrt{m/n} (ignoring the \\log(1/\\delta) term), but the gap in Bartlett and Srebro\u2019s quantity could be large if the coefficient norm is large.\n\n\nQ: Based on Figure 2, it seems that pacGen only roughly follows the right \u201corder\u201d of networks generalizing better than others. If pacGen is somehow superior to other quantities, why not to evaluate the actual bound? \n\nA: Thanks for the great suggestion. Unfortunately it is difficult to calculate the bound exactly due to technical difficulties involved in the estimation of the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian in the local neighborhood. Instead, we propose heuristically approximated quantities like pacGen. As we mention in the last paragraph of Section 5, this algorithm and metric are not rigorous. \n\n\nQ: The introduction is not only poorly written, but many of the statements are questionable. Par 2: What complexity are you talking about? What exactly is being contradicted by the empirical evidence that over-parametrized models generalize? \n\nA: We apologize we did not make it clear in the introduction. The complexity we intended to discuss was the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space. The contradiction is as suggested by C. Zhang et al. that over-parameterized neural network can fit any function of sample size n, making the Rademacher complexity large, but empirically those neural networks generalize fairly well. We added a footnote to make this clear in the updated version.

We tried dropout rates of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5. The results are plotted together with the perturbation algorithm. Note that dropout can be viewed as a multiplicative perturbation. In theory, there is no guarantee for which one would work better. But, empirically we observe better performance on the perturbed algorithm. One possible explanation is that dropout is set the same on all parameters, but the perturbation algorithm makes use of the local smoothness property for each parameter.\n", "title": "We appreciate your suggestions and comments to make this draft better."}, "rkeEh0KuC7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HyelTxG53m", "comment": "Thanks very much for your careful reading and insightful suggestions. \n\n\nQ: \u201cIt is confusing that Equations (4) and (9) defines slightly differently \\sigma*_i(w*,\\eta,\\gamma).

The model is a 5-layer MLP with 2 neurons in each hidden layer and sigmoid as activation. There are no bias terms in the linear layers, and the weights are shared across layers. For the 2-by-2 linear coefficient matrix, we treat two entries as constants and optimize the other 2 entries. In this way the whole model only has two parameters w_1 and w_2.\n\n2. Figure (b) shows the input distribution constructed by thresholding a mixture of 3 Gaussians from the median. Figure (c) and (d) are plotted by predictions using the two parameters at the sharp minimum and flat minimum, respectively. The prediction using the flat minimum does not fit the labels so well as the sharp one. That\u2019s why (d) only shows green labels. On the other hand, (d) also shows the predicted labels from the flat minimum has a simpler classification boundary compared to (c).\n\n\nQ: It is said to justify the perturbed optimization algorithm that Theorem 1 (based on Neyshabur et al. 2017) suggests minimizing a perturbed empirical loss.

In regards to the question of justification, we were inspired by the work of Dziugaite and Roy (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.11008) which also optimizes the perturbed generalization bound and not the deterministic empirical loss as itself.

For continuously\nparameterized models, PAC-Bayesian bounds are fundamentally based on\nparameter perturbation (non-singular posteriors).  So PAC-Bayesian\ntheory is naturally tied to parameter perturbation issues.  A more\nrefined question is whether the size of the perturbation should be\ndone on a per-parameter bases and whether per-parameter noise levels\nshould be adaptive --- should the appropriate noise level for each\nparameter be adjusted on the basis of statistics in the training data.\nAdam and RMS-prop both adapt per-parameter learning rate eta_i to be\nproportional to 1/((E g_i^2) + epsilon) where E g_i^2 is some running\nestimate of the expectation over a draw of a training point of the\nsquare of the gradient of the loss with respect to parameter i.

It seems that all theoretical analyses require the square\nroot --- the units need to work.  A fundamental theoretical question,\nperhaps unrelated to this paper, is why in learning rate adaptation the\nsquare root hurts the performance.\n\nThis paper can be evaluated on both theoretical and empirical grounds.\nAt a theoretical level I have several complaints.  First, the\ntheoretical analysis seem fairly mechanical and without theoretical\ninnovation. Second, the analysis obscures the prior being used (the\nlearning bias). The paper first states an assumption that each\nparameter is a-priori taken to be uniform over |w_i| <= \\tau_i and the\nKL-divergence in the PAC-Bayes bound is then log tau_i/sigma_i where\nsigma_i is the width of a uniform posterior over a smaller interval.\nBut later they say that they approximate tau_i by |w_i| + kappa_i with\nkappa_i = \\gamma |w_i| + epsilon.
