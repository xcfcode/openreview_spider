CNNs have proven to be very good classifiers and generally localize objects well; however, the loss functions typically used to train classification CNNs do not penalize inability to localize an object, nor do they take into account an object's relative size in the given image. During training on ImageNet-1K almost all approaches use random crops on the images and this transformation sometimes provides the CNN with background only samples. This causes the classifiers to depend on context. Context dependence is harmful for safety-critical applications. We present a novel approach to classification that combines the ideas of objectness and label smoothing during training. Unlike previous methods, we compute a smoothing factor that is \\emph{adaptive} based on relative object size within an image. This causes our approach to produce confidences that are grounded in the size of the object being classified instead of relying on context to make the correct predictions. We present extensive results using ImageNet to demonstrate that CNNs trained using adaptive label smoothing are much less likely to be overconfident in their predictions. We show qualitative results using class activation maps and quantitative results using classification and transfer learning tasks. Our approach is able to produce an order of magnitude reduction in confidence when predicting on context only images when compared to baselines.

But let's think out of the box and introduce stronger forms of supervision - e.g. bounding boxes for the object of interest. What benefits will they bring? The paper is arguing that the added strong supervision (boxes on top of ImageNet dataset) helps image classifiers reduce their over-confidence. This is done by training the classifier with the **adaptive label smoothing**, where each CNN input is assessed according to the actual proportion of the foreground object and the target vector is label smoothed to reflect the proportion.\n\n**Pros**\nThe paper is one of those papers which dig into the overlooked bits in the widespread practice. Given that the point is valid and solidly tested under extensive experiments, the paper is likely to leave a strong mark in the research community, providing researchers and practitioners chances to re-think about their habits and hidden assumptions. This paper has great potential to guide the researcher in such a direction. I believe we can also learn from this paper potentials to use strong supervision for improving not only the main task performance (e.g. classification) but also guide \"how\" the models should achieve the recognition - e.g. by improving the input attribution (explainability), robustness (adversarial and natural), bias (e.g. texture or bg bias), and uncertainty (as done in this paper).\n\n**Cons**\nIt is a little unfortunate that the paper falls short in terms of presentation and experimental depth. It is not fully convincing yet that the proposed solution is working, given the width and depth of experiments. I would highly suggest the authors re-structure the paper and add substantially more experimental validations for the next paper. Below are more specific comments on the weaknesses.\n\n1. **The proposed adaptive label smoothing actually worsens many of the key performance metrics.**\nIn Table 1, we observe that compared to \"hard label\" (0.669 top-1 accuracy), \"A. L. S.\" (or adaptive label smoothing) has only 0.655 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet validation set. It is a bit difficult to swallow the result, given that ALS is **requiring more annotation budgets** (bounding boxes) to prepare the training set. It is not only the main task where ALS is falling short. Also on calibration metrics (ECE and MCE), ALS is doing **worse** than the baseline, with higher ECE and MCE measures (lower is better). The authors argue that ALS successfully decreases the overconfidence, which is true indeed, but this is only half of the story! By decreasing the overall confidence, ALS turns out to further decrease confidence in correct prediction (underconfidence scores). Table 1 seems to suggest that ALS is actually not working.\n\n2. **Given the breadth and ramifications of the claim (see pros above), the set of experiments seems limited (only ImageNet + ResNet50 + COCO transfer learning).**\nGiven that the issue 1 above is resolved, I would still suggest doing more experiments on more datasets (e.g. OpenImages?) and more architectures (e.g. Other ResNet or EfficientNet families) to ensure that ALS is actually working, independent of the specific dataset-architecture pair.\n\n3. **Structure the paper better.**\nThe paper spends multiple paragraphs repeating points that are already made (sections 1,2) and spends so little on important implementation details and evaluation setups (section 4). There are seven paragraphs in section 1 - please aim to make it four paragraphs. This will include moving the experimental analysis on the confidence scores to section 4 (introduction is not a good place to already talk about numbers!). Try to shorten the six paragraphs in section 2 into three paragraphs. \nThe paper will now be only 6.5-7 pages long. With the remaining pages, describe the following in greater details:\n- The different splits of ImageNet-1K training set: please give them names & use the designated names in Tables 1&2.\n- Write down the precise implementation details and the definitions of evaluation metrics in 4.2 (e.g. ECE, MCE, under/overconfidence) instead of referring readers to the previous papers. Please indicate whether higher or lower values are better (also in the tables).\n- When discussing the results, please talk about **all** the results for all evaluation metrics, instead of just overconfidence, as done in section 4.2. Please also talk with numbers, instead of just saying e.g. \"these results have a low overconfidence score\".\n\n4. **Nits**\n* When I checked last time, ImageNet training set had **42%** images annotated with bounding boxes. Is **38%** (section 4.1) correct?\n* (Lin et al., 2014) --> MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014) \n* described in -2 --> described in table 2\n* allows the CNNs to cheat: I find it difficult to agree with that statement. There are many papers saying the use of context has helped a lot in their application scenarios. Please tone it down.\n\n5. **Final idea to throw**\nDid you consider using unsupervised objectness methods - like Edgebox, Selective search, MCG object proposals? Or saliency detection methods (https://paperswithcode.com/task/salient-object-detection)? Being able to use them will replace your need for bounding box supervision.\n\n**Key reasons for the rating**\n\nWhile the paper has and triggers many great ideas for researchers in this field, the experimental results are not supporting the main idea and claims. The presentation is quite a bit of an issue too. My suggestion is to substantially improve and scale-up the experiments for the next conference.\n\n**Response to the last comments made by the authors**\nThe referenced paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04933.pdf ) is not answering the question I have. Nor does section 4.2.\n\nMy question is: does ALS really improve the quality of uncertainty?\n\nThe paper's answer seems to be no.\n\nLook at Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the revised paper. It is great that ALS achieves a lower O.conf (overconfidence), meaning that for wrong predictions, ALS helps to produce lower confidence values. However, this comes at the cost of higher U.conf (underconfidence), meaning that even for correct predictions, ALS makes the model produce low confidence values. A confidence measure that always produces a low value, regardless of whether the prediction was correct or not, is not useful.\n\nThe authors may say \"look at Table 1 - our uncertainty measure produces lower scores for images with objects removed\". While this is true and it is a good signal, object removal is only a particular case for introducing uncertainty in an image. Eventually, I believe a good uncertainty measure should first of all produce a good ranking of test images such that the correctly predicted images are ranked first (this paper does not quantify this). Then comes the question of calibration (like ECE and MCE). Then comes the evaluations with specific uncertainty scenarios (like OOD images, object removal, or other controls on image uncertainty).", "title": "Nice idea but the experiments are not meeting the expectations", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "0Yh3a-x0E3R": {"type": "review", "replyto": "wqRvVvMbJAT", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper introduces the concept of adaptive label smoothing (ALS).  ALS uses bounding box annotations of objects to determine how much area in the image is covered by the object and uses this estimate to change the weight in the label smoothing operation, with the goal to encourage the classifier to focus on the object and not on the context around the object during classification. The experiments on ImageNet classification show an improved classifier calibration, while for detection, the improvements are marginal.\n\nPros:\n- The paper is well written and easy to understand\n- The problem of reducing the effect of background biases on a classifier's performance is important\n- The classifier calibration on ImageNet is improved\n\nCons:\n- The method requires additional supervision in terms of bounding box annotations. It would be interesting to study unsupervised methods for estimating the objectness, e.g., using unsupervised segmentation.\n- The proposed method does not significantly improve over the baselines on object detection. I think the authors should discuss this in more detail.\n- It would be great if the paper would also discuss alternative measures for adapting the smoothing factor. \n- The overall contribution of this paper is rather limited.

ALS is actually not working.\u201d: Our accuracy is lower as we discourage our model from relying on context to make correct predictions. CutMix is able to report an accuracy of 9.2% even when no objects are present! Traditional approaches might produce excellent results on a given dataset, but such approaches suffer when deployed for real-world applications.The benefit of the method is that, under uncertain conditions (real-world conditions), we are able to produce an order of magnitude reduction in average confidence when no pertinent objects are present in a given image. On a given dataset, context helps traditional classifiers make correct predictions, but for real-world applications, such reliance can result in harmful effects (as in the case of autonomous driving). Our approach adds additional penalty terms to the loss function as we explain in the paper. ECE and MCE help with quantifying the discrepancy between a model's predictions and its accuracy. Our predictions are grounded in objectness scores and that is the reason why we are more accurate than we are confident compared to other baselines. The underconfidence is higher also because we are not trying to predict with the maximum possible confidence of 1, but we predict with a confidence proportional to the objectness score. Underconfidence has no effect on accuracy as argmax of the vector is used to assign class labels. We have added additional discussion to the paper explaining how ALS is actually matching objectness of the imagenet validation samples better.\n\n\u201cexperiments on more datasets (e.g. OpenImages?) and more architectures\u201d: We have added ResNet101 and Openimages results.

Please tone it down.\u201d: We have changed the language, and we apologize for the negative connotation. Context is absolutely important. However, relying only on context to make correct predictions is not a good way to solve problems. We wanted to highlight the problem with some patch based methods (CutMix, RICAP). Even though they produce state of the art results on a given dataset, they are not applicable for real world applications or safety-critical applications (predicting a whale based on an underwater image containing no whale, for example).\n\n\u201cFinal idea to throw Did you consider using unsupervised objectness methods - like Edgebox, Selective search, MCG object proposals?

Our approach adds additional penalty terms to the loss function as we explain in the updated paper. We thoroughly demonstrate the effect of context dependence using ablation studies. We used the latest baselines (label smoothing and CutMix) to compare our approach. ICLR is the best venue to discuss the different representations we learn using our approach. We also discuss the main issues with traditional cross entropy loss. Predicting with a high confidence even when there is no evidence makes traditional classifiers ill suited for real-world deployment.\n\n\u201cThe method section is very small and is based on the label smoothing mechanism\u201d: We have expanded the method section and added discussion on cross entropy loss.

Instead, we explore the problem of context dependence when wrong labels are supplied during training. We do not tackle object localization, but instead we use bounding boxes to compute objectness scores. As R3 and R2 pointed out, there are many ways to compute objectness, even in an unsupervised way. Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods are finetuning ImageNet learnt representation, we are tackling classification with cross entropy loss smoothed using objectness score. We do not use GAP or new layers. Instead, we perform strict classification with soft labels instead of hard labels, using objectness to specify how object-rich the input is. We are interested in reducing classifier overconfidence. The better localization is a by-product, and not our main task. Our goal is not to produce attention maps to come up with better object proposals, but instead our goal is to supply accurate labels during training. Instead of supplying a binary value of 1 or 0, we supply a value based on the objectness score. WSOL methods can be used to provide gross objectness values for datasets where such information is not available.\n\u201cOverall, I like the analysis to quantify the context dependence. I just wonder how the mean pixel values and the shape of the box contain some information. For example, is it possible to predict the class of an object by using the shape of the bounding box. I think it can be interesting to verify it.\u201d: The reason behind using mean pixel values is to not skew the input distribution, especially when batch normalization is used. It would be interesting to quantify this bias as well.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to read the tables 1 and 2\u201d: We have streamlined the tables and moved the larger versions to the appendix.\n\n\u201cgeneralize this approach to a multi-label dataset like MS COCO or OpenImages\u201d: It should be able to generalize, but as we operate in a classification domain we are concerned with classifying one object at a time. The train split that we identify with 0.474M in table 5 has multiple objects present naturally and our results are consistent. More information is now available in the appendix. We combined sample mixing (CutMix) and our approach, but mixing samples from different contexts was not helpful.\n\n\u201cThe idea of using bounding boxes to train deep models is not new. For example, [1] uses bounding boxes. Using bounding boxes allows to learn better representation but these annotations are costly to get.

The idea is to adjust the entropy of the labels in proportion to the amount of objectness of an image i.e. the amount of pixels related to the object. Experiments shows that the adjusted labels reduce the overconfidence of a classification network.\n\nStrengths:\n+ the paper is easy to read and presented well, beside some small issues that can be fixed easily.\n+ related works are comprehensive and the method is really easy, which is a plus.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- experiments and results show limited benefit from the method. It seems that the only impact is in the object classification task where the overconfidence is reduce at the expense of the underconfidence, which means that there is a tradeoff in the confidence of trained classifier. It is not clear when it should be used and why. Moreover, the object detection results show similar performance of AP, even inferior of CutMix, without a proper measurement of confidence in that case.\n- the method needs the amount of percentage of pixels of the object to adjust the labels. In practise, it needs the bounding boxes of the objects. This naturally suggests that the task should be evaluated in terms of object detection task. Results in this regards show that after finetuning there is minimal or negative impact (e.g. beta <<), rendering the method useless to my understanding.\n\nIn particular:\n- OpenImages dataset is mentioned in 4.3, but COCO is used. COCO is not described anywhere.\n- It is not clear the experimental setting when there are multiple annotated objects (sec 4.1). There is mention that 54k more images are derived but it is not clear how.\n- It would be interesting to compare the method with a baseline neural network that not only emits the label of an object and thus we need to compute the entropy of the answer, but also an additional output with the confidence of the score.\n- Discussion in 4.2 does not discuss the other metrics ECE, U.conf, MCE enough to give some insights about the results. In particular the U.conf gets higher with the method. What is happening and how does this affects the confidence?\n- It is not clear in table 2 what are the two experiments with 0.474M pre train N and what information they give.\n- Sec 4.4 mentions table 1 regarding the beta parameter, but it is not used. Should it be table 2?\n", "title": "Simple idea but results are not convincing", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}}}
