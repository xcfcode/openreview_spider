We do not think the formula in the middle of Prelim (2), that is, $\\big(\\frac{10^{-23}}{10^{-5}}\\big)^{-30} \\approx 0.25$, holds. We doubt about Prelim (3) as well.\n\nWe find that the statement made by the Researcher in prelim 3 does not seem to be qualitatively correct. For instance, it is stated that \"This is because all operations involved in $h$ and $F$ are very similar when evaluated in the forward and backward direction.\" However, it can be seen that ||h'|| is the norm of the kronecker delta, drastically different when compared to ||h||. Further, in F', the non-linearity layers have inherently different shapes - for sigmoid and tanh, the forward pass is only zero at the origin, whereas in the backward pass, the gradient of sigmoid and tanh are essentially zero in the flat region of sigmoid and tanh away from the origin. Similarly for ReLU, the gradient is the step function, and only has similar behaviors near values h = 1. F and F' behaves differently on a qualitative level. \n\nTherefore, it does not appear that this is the correct explanation ||F'||/||h'|| has a similar value to ||F||/||h||, as F and F' behave drastically differently in backward and forward passes. We think that this is overreaching on a scale larger than us ignoring the second term in the gradient decoupling section even if ||F'|| is of order O(0.1).\n\nIn addition, our discussion on gradient decoupling in Section 2 is just to provide an analysis on ResNet. In WarpNet, we did not use gradient decoupling in the backward pass as shown in Section 3.2. To prevent the readers from thinking that we used gradient decoupling in the backward pass of WarpNet, we think we should drop off the paragraphs related to gradient decoupling in Section 2 (which only pertains to ResNet).\n\nSince the Researcher's Prelims (2) and (3) are only related to our discussions on gradient decoupling, this treatment resolves our dispute in this regard.\n\nRegarding the Researcher's comment \u201cthe experiments are still insufficient\u201d, we would like to emphasize that in the revision we provided new experimental results from over 110 runs. The new experiments were done with different parameter settings on 3 data sets. We also compared with data parallelism. We are surprised to discover that the Researcher insists that the experiments are insufficient. We worked extremely diligently in the past two months to obtain these new results, and our results confirmed that WarpNet is an effective and much faster alternative to ResNet. We hope our innovative contribution can be properly recognized!\n\nRegarding the Researcher's comment \"not everyone has the resources to parallelize training\", now it is quite common for deep learning researchers and AI companies to have or have access to GPU servers with multiple GPUs. Companies that provide GPU cloud services (such as Google, IBM, Amazon, Oracle and Nvidia) have hundreds of GPUs in their cloud. We believe our proposed WarpNet will be very useful to researchers and practitioners who look for fast deep learning solutions.", "title": "Response to the Researcher's other comments"}, "rkDRpk_4M": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJAGxsHNf", "comment": "Dear Researcher,\n\nWe think that the debate between the Researcher and us rises partially from a misunderstanding from the Researcher's part on when one can apply the Taylor expansion.\n\nThe Taylor expansion can only be applied to provide a LOCAL polynomial type of approximation of a function value at a relatively small neighborhood of a given point which does not lie on any boundary. Mathematically speaking, a Taylor expansion should only be done in a small neighborhood of a given x, say (x-e,  x+e), where e is a small numerical term.\n\nMany of the Researcher's arguments are based on a constructed example in Prelim 1) which tried to demonstrate the inaccuracy of the Taylor expansion. However, that example is irrelevant since a Taylor expansion should NOT be applied in the first place. In particular, e is much bigger than x so it violates the condition of using Taylor expansion. It is akin to forcing a short term weather forecast model to do a long term prediction.\n\nIn our framework, all conditions of applying the Taylor expansion have been checked carefully. In our case of F2(x1+F1), x = x1 and e = F1. It is clear that F1 < x1.\n\nWe find that the Taylor expansion is not only suitable but also brings very significant computational advantages as explained in the next paragraph.\n\nThe WarpNet (from the Taylor expansion) provides a novel way of training ResNets in parallel: model parallelism in which different sets of weights are trained in parallel (which we believe is attractive to the industry). It can be trained faster compared to mini-batch parallelization of ResNet (Section 4.3), and allows a larger network to be trained (for which ResNet fails to train due to GPU memory limitation, see Section 4.2) as WarpNet splits the weight storage into different GPUs. This offers significant advantages since GPU memory is often quite limited. Our experimental results also show that the predictive performance of WarpNet and that of the corresponding ResNet are very similar owing to the good Taylor expansion. Further, we find that the validation error curve of WarpNet can lie on top of each other with that of ResNet throughout training (Figure 2).\n\nAfter carefully reading the Researcher's responses, it appears that some of the disputes arise from different definitions of \"high order terms\". For instance, in Part [2/5], the Researcher mentions that $O(e^2)$ terms dominate, and that \"While it is true that individual higher-order terms are smaller, this is more than made up by their greater frequency.\" in an earlier response. We conclude that the \"high order terms\" the Researcher refer to is not the same as our \"high order terms\".\n\nTo be more specific, the Researcher appears to refer to the binomial number of terms in powers of $F'$ by multiplying out the gradient $(h'_1 + F'_1)(h'_2 + F'_2)..$ in a ResNet. Following our convention in the paper, we denote these as binomial terms. However, our \"high order terms\" correspond to the order of derivative terms in the Taylor expansion. The binomial terms and the Taylor series terms are completely different. In our analytical analysis we included -all- binomial terms, which the Researcher refers to as \"high order terms\". The Taylor series is truncated by the ReLU to first order. However, in Appendix A we have shown that using multiple iterations of Taylor expansions layer by layer results in a binomial number of first order terms, where each binomial term consists of a product of $k-1$ $F'$. Nowhere in the analytical analysis we have neglected first order Taylor series terms of power larger than 1 in $F'$. We believe that this resolves the discrepancy between our results and those stated by the Researcher.", "title": "Taylor expansion is accurate and WarpNet is sound, innovative and effective"}, "ryCv5QFgz": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SyMvJrdaW", "review": "Motivated via Talor approximation of the Residual network on a local minima, this paper proposed a warp operator that can replace a block of a consecutive number of residual layers.

As demonstrated in the paper, this improves the training time with multi-GPU parallelization, while maintaining similar performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\n\nOne thing that is currently not very clear to me is about the rotational symmetry. The paper mentioned rotated filters, but continue to talk about the rotation in the sense of an orthogonal matrix applying to the weight matrix of a convolution layer. The rotation of the filters (as 2D images or images with depth) seem to be quite different from \"rotating\" a general N-dim vectors in an abstract Euclidean space.

Finally the authors stack these warp layers to create a \u201cwarped resnet\u201d which they show does about as well as an ordinary ResNet but has better parallelization properties.\n\nTo me the analytical parts of the paper are the most interesting, particularly in showing how the gradients approximately decouple.  However there are several weaknesses to the paper (or maybe just things I didn\u2019t understand).  First,  a major part of the paper tries to make the case that there is a symmetry breaking property of the proposed model, which I am afraid I simply was not able to follow.  Some of the notation is confusing here \u2014 for example, presumably the rotations refer to image level rotations rather than literally multiplying the inputs by an orthogonal matrix, which the notation suggests to be the case.

We provide two proofs of this theorem in appendix A.\u00a0\n\nThe first is a brute force approach, where we show that the number of terms with the same powers in F and F' after consecutive Taylor expansions satisfies the same recursion relation as the binomial coefficients. The also show explicitly that the number of terms with the same power in F and F' for x3 and x4 are binomial coefficients. Then, by induction, it follows that the number of terms of power k across K residual units is the binomial coefficient (K, k).\n\nThe second proof starts by noting that each iteration of the Taylor series expansion can be described as a Bernoulli process with parameters K and p=0.5. It follows that any term in the Taylor series expansion is a realization of the Bernoulli process. The underlying Bernoulli variables correspond to whether a term gets an addition power of F' in the Taylor series expansion.

There are indeed differences in the two Taylor series expansions. We expand the outputs of residual units across layers where they expand the loss function.

The confusion is particularly acute in places where derivatives are taken, because the derivatives continue to be taken as if the weights were untied, but then written as if they happened to be the same.\n\nWe have added a general formula for the first order Taylor series for all K in Equation (3) to clarify how the equation should be read. The exponential gradient scaling result can then be derived by differentiating this expression with respect to x. The only non vanishing term in the differentiation comes from the right-most factor, F, since all F'' = 0 almost exactly when ReLU is used. Then setting all weights to be equal results in the binomial coefficient and (F') to the power of k. We have also clarified the derivation of the formula in the gradient decoupling paragraph. In addition, we have provided a proof of binomial path lengths in the appendix and we hope that this will clarify the presentation of this paper.\n\n* It would be stronger to evaluate results on a larger dataset like ILSVRC.\n\nWe have added a subsection (4.2) that compares WarpNet with ResNet on ImageNet on a few different settings. Using the ImageNet data set, we also illustrates the \"almost-exactness\" of the first order Taylor series in Figure 2, where the validation curves of the WRN-73-2 and it's approximation WarpNet-73-2 (K=2) approximation lie almost on top of each other during training.\n\n* The relative speed-up of WarpNet compared to ResNet needs to be better explained \u2014 the authors break the computation of the WarpNet onto two GPUs, but it\u2019s not clear if they do this for the (vanilla) ResNet as well.

If all layers were parallelized in this way, the network would perform very badly. Parallelizing pairs of layers is a relatively mild approximation and so it does not lead to catastrophic results because of the inherent robustness of neural networks.\"\n\nThe approximation is almost exact with ReLU as both Veit's and our work together have shown, up to a path length of 25. We have performed \"parallelization\" over 3 layers in various settings in the past few weeks after obtaining access to servers with 4GPUs which allowed us to scale up our experiments. We found that the predictive accuracy remains similar to that of a ResNet with the same number of parameters, and the speedup of WarpNet over ResNet is increased when K=3 compared to K=2. ReLUs are used in our experiments.\n\n\"*No! In typical architectures, the first-order approximation of a deep ResNet is not close at all to the actual ResNet. This can be verified easily by simply computing that approximation directly. You will find that outputs are very different and the error of the approximation, while probably better than chance, will be nowhere near the original trained network.\"\n\nThe first order approximation is actually almost exact for the actual ResNet if ReLUs are used. We have analytically shown that the first order Taylor series expansion agrees with Veit's Figure 6(a) for the path length distribution, and 6(b) for the gradient scaling up to path lengths of about 25. Both Veit and we employed ReLUs. The validity of the linear approximation extends beyond the effective path length (Fig 6(c) in Veit) which is at most 20. This confirms that the first order series is almost exact.\n\nWe guess that the confusion might be caused by our infrequent mentioning that ReLU is used in our analysis, and we will state that we have used ReLU non-linearities more often in our paper.\n\n\"*No! The norm of the Jacobian of the residual path is ~ 1 / sqrt(i) in the typical architecture defined above if we ignore terms pertaining to network width. It is certainly nowhere near 10^-6. The Veit paper uses the value 10^-6 only once, but in a completely different context that this author claims. This shows that the authors of this paper have not understood the Veit paper.\"\n\nThere are two (not only once) appearances of 10^-6 in Veit's paper. We took the 10^-6 number from Figure 6(b). There it shows that the gradient norm descents from about 10^-6 down to 10^-25 at path length 25. Another appearance of 10^-6 just before section 4.3 in Veit et al, we did not use that 10^-6 there. \n\n\"*The fact that ReLU has no second derivative almost surely does not mean that the first order theory is exact. It is only exact in a region around each point that is enclosed by a non-differentiable boundary. But that region is much, much smaller than the size of the residual function and therefore does not apply to the author's analysis.\"\n\nOnly a single point (the origin) in ReLU is non-differentiable. In any other region the first order term approximation is exact. As discussed before our work shows the first order approximation is almost exact with experimental validation from Veit et al.\n\n\"*'This is an important result, which suggests that to the first non-vanishing order in gradient norm, the local minima is independent of parameters in subsequent residual units.'This is not true, because the O(\\epsilon) assumption is not true.\"\n\nAs we discussed before, the second order terms vanish because of the ReLU non-linearity we used.

Actually, the value of ||F||/||h|| has nothing to do with the validity of using the first order Taylor series to expand F (and thus the validity of the WarpNet). The purpose of the paragraph in question is an attempt to explain some observations about ResNet found in the literature. That paragraph in question only pertains to ResNet and we do not need small a ||F||/||h|| to perform the Taylor expansion on F. Therefore the subsequent sections and the validity of WarpNet are unaffected.\n\nThat being said, we thank the researcher for pointing out ||F||/||h|| ~ 1/sqrt(i). We agree with you that we should not say F is very small. We will remove this confusing and irrelevant paragraph and it will certainly make our paper easier to read. It actually better motivates the expansion of F if F is not very small.\n\n\"*(3) is not meaningful. In practical ResNets, the O(e^2) term would dominate. While it is true that individual higher-order terms are smaller, this is more than made up by their greater frequency. In the Veit et al paper that this paper cites repeatedly, it is clearly demonstrated that in a typical ResNet, terms of a certain order dominate the gradient expansion (and therefore the Taylor expansion) and that this order is significantly greater than 1.\"\n\nRegrettably, we are unable to find any form of series expansion in Veit's paper. We would appreciate it if the researcher would kindly point us to the location in Veit et al that they refer to as the \"gradient expansion\". The O(e^2) term does not dominate with ReLU non-linearities. Veit's paper confirms our analytical results.", "title": "No fatal mathematical flaws in our analysis"}}}
