The noise is introduced due to a variety of reasons; it is heterogeneous and feature-dependent. Most existing approaches to handling noisy labels fall into two categories: they either assume an ideal feature-independent noise, or remain heuristic without theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose to target a new family of feature-dependent label noise, which is much more general than commonly used i.i.d. label noise and encompasses a broad spectrum of noise patterns. Focusing on this general noise family, we propose a progressive label correction algorithm that iteratively corrects labels and refines the model. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that for a wide variety of (unknown) noise patterns, a classifier trained with this strategy converges to be consistent with the Bayes classifier. In experiments, our method outperforms SOTA baselines and is robust to various noise types and levels.", "keywords": ["Noisy Label", "Deep Learning", "Classification"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Spotlight)", "comment": "This paper studies the problem of learning from data that have been corrupted by label noise. The authors define a natural data-dependent noise condition, that allows the noise rate to be large close to the decision boundary, and provide a simple iterative method that eventually converges to the Bayes optimal classifier.

We appreciate the positive feedback. We have read the referred paper [1] and will cite it in our camera-ready version. \n\nWe would like to clarify that the IDN in [1] is very different and indeed much more restrictive than the diminishing noise proposed in our paper. __Thus, the claims in [1] regarding IDN does not apply to our noise model.__  In particular, the IDN in [1] requires the noise to be positively correlated with the confidence of the Bayesian/clean classifier. Whereas in our paper, we only require the noise to be upper bounded in some high confidence region and allow it to be arbitrary everywhere else.

At the very least, they could add to the evaluation the CUB-200 dataset from [Yi & Wu, 2019]\n\n**A:**  Thanks for the suggestion. We conduct experiments on three additional real-world datasets, including CUB-200.\n\n(1) Food-101N [1], which is a dataset for food classification. It consists of 310k training images collected from the web. The estimated label purity is 80%. Following [1], the classification accuracy is evaluated on the Food-101 [2] test set, which contains 25k images with curated annotations. We use ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. We train the network for 30 epochs with SGD optimizer. The batch size is 32 and the initial learning rate is 0.005, which is divided by 10 every 10 epochs. We also adopt simple data augmentation procedures, including random horizontal fiip, and resizing the image with a short edge of 256 and then randomly cropping a 224x224 patch from the resized image. We repeat the experiments with 3 random trials and report the mean value and standard deviation. The results are as follows:\n\n|||\n|:---|---:|\n|Standard         | 81.67|\n|CleanNet [1]   | 83.95|\n|PCL (ours)      | 85.28\u00b10.04|\n|||\n\nOur method achieves better performance than CleanNet. Note that we do not use the extra 55k manually cleaned training data, which are utilized by CleanNet for noise detection.\n\n(2) ANIMAL-10N [3], which is a real-world noisy dataset consisting of human-labeled online images for 10 animals with confusing appearance. The estimated label noise rate is 8%. There are 50,000 training and 5,000 testing images. Following [3], we use VGG-19 with batch normalization. The SGD optimizer is employed. Following [3], we train the network for 100 epochs and use an initial learning rate of 0.1, which is divided by 5 at 50% and 75% of the total number of epochs. We repeat the experiments with 3 random trials and report the mean value and standard deviation. The results are as follows:\n\n|||\n|:---|---:|\n|Standard         | 79.4\u00b10.14|\n|SELFIE [3]      | 81.8\u00b10.09|\n|PCL (ours)      | 83.4\u00b10.43|\n|||\n\nWe observe that our method achieves better performance than SELFIE.\n\n(3) Following the suggestion of AnonReviewer1, we conduct experiments on the CUB-200 [4] which is for fine-grained bird classification. The labels in this dataset are considered clean. We use ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. Simple data augmentation procedures are also applied, including horizontal random flip, and resizing the image to 256x256 and then randomly cropping a 224x224 patch from the resized image. We use SGD optimizer and batch size of 16. The initial learning rate is 0.002, which is divided by 10 after 100, 120 and 140 epochs. The total number of training epochs is 160.\n\nThe standard method (using cross entropy loss alone) achieves classification accuracy 79.91\u00b10.04. Our PCL method has accuracy 79.99\u00b10.04. The performance of our method does not drop for a dataset without any noise. \n\n[1] Kuang-Huei Lee, Xiaodong He, Lei Zhang, and Linjun Yang.

Let us revise our statement as follows: (Menon et al. 2018) provides an elegant theoretical framework, showing that losses fulfilling certain conditions naturally resist instance-dependent noise. The method can achieve even better theoretical properties (i.e., Bayes-consistency) with stronger assumption on the clean posterior probability $\\eta$. In practice, this method has not been extended to deep neural networks. We empirically compare this method with ours. We follow the experimental setting of Menon et al.

Some of the methods were mentioned in the related works section, but some are not (why not?), and neither section explains some of the choices.\n\n**A:** We select a collection of recent methods representing different strategies. Co-teaching+ is a data-selection method: it selects the clean data by training two networks simultaneously, and then updates the networks on the selected clean data. GCE and SL aim to combat the label noise with noise-tolerant losses. LRT not only detects the noisy labels but also corrects them. This way more training data are utilized, compared with data-selection methods. We think these methods are reasonably representative of the recent developments in learning with label noise. \n\nThanks for the suggestion regarding the related work.

Below the threshold (when the true label probability is closer to 0.5), the noise is unbounded.\n\nThe authors introduce an algorithm, \"Progressive Label Correction\", which iteratively flips the training labels of examples for which the model's confidence is above a threshold. The threshold decreases over time, so that only the most confident examples are flipped at first, and then the less-confident examples are flipped later.\n\nThe authors prove (Theorem 1) that under the assumption of PMD label noise distribution, as well as Assumption 1 concerning the flexibility of the hypothesis class and the continuity of the true label's conditional distribution, then their Progressive Label Correction algorithm asymptotically approaches a set of corrected labels that match the true (de-noised) labels with high probability.\n\nThe authors experimentally show that their algorithm consistently outperforms 5 alternatives on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with various types of synthetic noise, both feature-dependent and hybrid feature-depedent/indepdendent. Finally, they show their algorithm outperforms 10 alternatives on a real-world dataset (Clothing1M) with unknown noise.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nQuality: Overall I like this paper. It's a pretty simple algorithm to implement, and it seems to be quite effective in practice and have nice theoretical properties.\n\nClarity: The paper is structured very well.
