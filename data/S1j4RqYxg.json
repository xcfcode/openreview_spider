However, the experimental evaluation is quite preliminary and the paper would be helped a lot with a connection to a motivating application. All of the reviewers pointed out that the work is not written in the usual in the scope of ICLR papers, and putting these together at this time it makes sense to reject the paper."}, "review": {"ryd5tDySx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B17Fn04Vg", "comment": "Thank you for all your excellent points. They've been well received and will result in a stronger submission to a conference that's a better match.\n\nI have just one question: You pointed out the lack of citations, and I wonder whether you know of any particular related workI looked for other works that improve the complexity of polynomial expansions, but couldn't find any. I came to the conclusion that it's just not something that's been worked on, so I'd be very grateful if you know of something in particular.\n\nVery best,\n-Andrew", "title": "Thank you (with one question)"}}}
