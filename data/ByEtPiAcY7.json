The central challenge is to find an explanation which is more comprehensible than the original model while still representing that model faithfully. The distributed nature of deep networks has led many to believe that the hidden features of a neural network cannot be explained by logical descriptions simple enough to be understood by humans, and that decompositional knowledge extraction should be abandoned in favour of other methods. In this paper we examine this question systematically by proposing a knowledge extraction method using \\textit{M-of-N} rules which allows us to map the complexity/accuracy landscape of rules describing hidden features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments reported in this paper show that the shape of this landscape reveals an optimal trade off between comprehensibility and accuracy, showing that each latent variable has an optimal \\textit{M-of-N} rule to describe its behaviour. We find that the rules with optimal tradeoff in the first and final layer have a high degree of explainability whereas the rules with the optimal tradeoff in the second and third layer are less explainable. The results shed light on the feasibility of rule extraction from deep networks, and point to the value of decompositional knowledge extraction as a method of explainability.", "keywords": ["Deep Networks", "Explainability", "Knowledge Extraction"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The presented paper introduces a method to represent neural networks as logical rules of varying complexity, and demonstrate a tradeoff between complexity and error.

The possible benefit of the approach is twofold. First, it can give us insight into the conditions which make a network more or less explainable with rule extraction.

It should be noted that there are many possible variables which can influence the complexity of hidden neurons including network architecture, dataset, and learning algorithm. We plan on making the code publicly available so that similar experiments can be run to gain insight into how these variables effect the complexity of the representations learned by a neural network.\n\nAlthough we use a relatively small number examples to evaluate the rules, repeating the experiments on a single neuron when evaluated on 5000 and 10000 examples produces very similar accuracy/complexity curves leading us to believe that the experiments give a fair representation of the relationship between the complexity and accuracy of extracted rules.", "title": "Response"}, "H1eqBPgDAX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HkgINMZPp7", "comment": "Thank you for your comments. \n\nAs you describe, our intention for the experiments was to evaluate the complexity of the concepts learned by hidden neurons. In the binary case every neuron can be described exactly by a rule so any error from an extracted rule is the result of not finding the optimal solution. Usually the failure of an extraction algorithm to find an accurate solution is the result of not allowing rules of sufficient complexity. Our proposed method is meant to show the degree to which failures of an extraction method are due to restricting complexity.\n\nWith regards to the weight-ordering, for a binary network it can be shown that, when evaluated over the whole input space, the best M-of-N rule is the one which includes the N literals with highest weight magnitude. The same is true for a continuous network on an input space of the form [a,b]^n if the neurons are binarized using the same value to split them.\n\nSince testing over the whole input space is infeasible we evaluate the rules on a subset of the training data which leaves open the possibility that a different ordering could result in more accurate rules on that subset but we feel that because of the reasons mentioned above the weight-ordering produces the most accurate M-of-N rules.\n\nOf course the search space of M-of-N rules themselves is only a subspace of all possible rules. We've included additional experiments on the simple but well known DNA-promoter dataset and find that complex M-of-N rules can accurately approximate the network suggesting that M-of-N is a reasonable restriction of the search space and that the results are a good representation of the accuracy/complexity relationship for extracted rules.\n\nWith regards to the second point, in principle you can replace the whole network with a hierarchy of extracted rules as long as you choose consistent splits to binarize the neurons in each layer. As you point out though this will cause errors to accumulate. Our goal was to produce a baseline accuracy/complexity relationship, practical rule extraction algorithms might not achieve these results but the method allows us to gain insight into feasibility of rule extraction as a method of explanation.\n\nThe results for robustness were tentative and have been removed in order to make room for a more complete discussion of the method. Further experiments on knowledge extraction and robustness will be done in the future.", "title": "Response"}, "BkeTdJNv6m": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ByEtPiAcY7", "review": "This paper is looking at how to extract knowledge from CNNs to help improve explainability and robustness against an adversarial attack.

Is it a machine learning expert, who wants to debug the model?  Is it an end user who wants to better understand why the prediction was made?  Is it a regulator who is trying to ensure the model's predictions are fair?\n\nEach of these personas will come with different needs and different technical backgrounds, so an assumption that some artifact (a rule set?) is \"explainable\" may apply to one group, but not the other group.  For example, rules are likely to be more explainable to a ML expert, but may not be to an end user, unless they are very small.\n\n", "title": "review", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "HkgINMZPp7": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ByEtPiAcY7", "review": "The paper proposes to rewrite each neuron of a neural network as a M-of-N decision rule. An measure of rule complexity (which takes into the account the number of terms in the rule) is proposed, and an approximate rule induction algorithm which binarizes the neurons using an information gain criterion is provided.\n\nThe paper gives no evaluation of the accuracy of extracted rules on a test set. Instead, the fidelity to network is evaluated on the train set for individual neurons (see below).\n\nSince even for moderately-sized networks the method would result in lots of rules, the authors propose instead to use the proposed algorithm and complexity criterion as a tool for understanding the complexity of concepts detected by a layer. The results, gathered in Figure 1, suggest that for some layers complex rules do approximate the behavior of neurons, while for other layers a neuron can't be replaced with a single but complex M-of-N rule.\n\nThe ideas presented in this paper seem rudimentary and require further exploration before being publishable. First of all, the main result of complexity-vs-layer doesn't differentiate between failures of the approximate rule induction algorithm (the terms in rules are considered for inclusion in a single order, reducing the search space) and the genuine complexity of the rules - this can be verified by evaluating a more exhaustive algorithm on at leas a few neurons (not necessarily on all of them).\n\nSecond, if the rules are extracted in a layerwise fashion,  their errors accumulate for deeper layers. However, Algorithm 1 suggests that each neuron is replaced by a rule independently from others, and moreover that it requires the true value of the neurons in the layer below, not of their rule counterparts. This means that the rules can't be combined and explains why the paper doesn't provide any measure for aggregate rule accuracy.\n\nSimilarly, the robustness of rules to adversarial examples is meaningless - it seems that applying the rules results in a system which is less accurate (only 8/10 of rules mimick their neurons with no rule complexity penalty) overall, but also makes fewer adversarial examples.\n\nMinor remarks.\nPlease don't ever produce Figures such as Figure 1: no legend (description in text), color selection is not black and white friendly, font is so small that the axis labels are hard to read...
