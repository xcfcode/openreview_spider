On one hand, the authors did a nice job in visualizing their findings and conducting a wealth of interesting experiments. On the other hand, the submission suffers severely from hand-waving definitions and arguments. Many terms were not precisely defined, various hyperparameters were not thoroughly investigated, and yet conclusions were made based on indirect experimental results. The AC agrees with the reviewers that it is not very clear how this work would impact the field. For exploratory work like this one, there is also a great danger that one may simply overfit the observations and squeeze conclusions from thin air. It would be more convincing if the authors could largely quantify their definitions and results. For example: what do we mean by human-aligned? robust / nonrobust feature? (this definition depends on the perturbation size hence needs more elaboration.) Is there any way to quantify the results in Fig 2, including the impact of epsilon? Should these adversarial examples be called universal if their ASR falls below what threshold? Are (some of) the conclusions (e.g. translation invariance, semantic) a direct consequence of the perturbation being universal? At this stage this work would be an excellent workshop paper but a bit more rigor would be needed for publishing at the ICLR conference.

This work challenges these traditional beliefs by pointing out that non-robust features can also be human-perception aligned and be less useful for generalization, if these non-robust features are discovered via universal adversarial perturbations (rather than via image-dependent perturbations). Extensive experiments are provided to justified these arguments.\n\n\n\n\n*Pros:\n\n(1) This paper is well written and easy to follow.\n\n(2) The idea of utilizing universal adversarial perturbations to analyze non-robust features is novel, and lead to many interesting findings of non-robust features, e.g., non-robust features can also be semantically meaningful.\n\n(3) Most arguments in this paper are rigorously justified by careful experiment designs. For example, by analyzing the effects of perturbation scaling on model performance, this paper successfully persuades the reviewer to believe universal adversarial perturbations indeed leverage non-robust features.\n\n\n\n*Cons:\n\n(1) The reviewer has a major concern about the experiments that show non-robust features can also fail to generalize. For example, Table 1 suggests that with a large base set, non-robust features' generalization decrease. Nonetheless, the reviewer worries that this effect may be caused by the reduced diversity of training samples. That's said, when training with a base set of K (i.e., K training samples will share the sample universal perturbation), the reviewer tends to think the training dataset's \"effective\" sample size will then be greatly reduced to (total sample size)/K, which will decrease training quality and lead to inferior generalization. To rule out this possibility, the authors should also investigate the setting where the number of universal perturbations is equal to the number of training samples, regardless of the value of the size of base set K. The dataset preparation could be like this: first, we randomly sample K images, and generate a universal perturbation for them; second, we randomly sample one image from K' samples (which successfully fool networks), add the generated universal perturbation, and put it to the new training set; third, repeat the first & second step until we collect enough images in this new training set. Only with the performance analysis using these datasets, we can then confidently justify if non-robust features can generalize.\n\n(2) The reviewer is a little bit curious (and worry) why different batch sizes lead to quite different performance as shown in Figure 8? As already shown in the \"Training ImageNet in 1hr\" paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) and many others, if you set the learning rate to be proportional to the batch size, then these training settings should get nearly the same results. Why this paper shows batch size is a critical hyperparameter for impacting model performance (e.g., in Figure 8, the settings of K=64, lr=0.5 batch size=32 and K=64, lr=1.0, batch size=64 seem to get very different results)?\n\n(3) why this paper only considers the targeted attack setting? will the conclusions here generalizable to the setting of non-targeted attack? Also what is the motivation for showing universal perturbations has spatial invariance (since image-dependent perturbation can also be spatial invariance if such transformation is considered by attackers)? \n\nIn general, the reviewer thinks it is an interesting paper, and is happy to raise the score if the authors successfully address the concerns above.

Reduced diversity may indeed have a possible confounding effect in our raw experimental setup. However, we found that varying the number of distinct perturbations (for fixed K) did not have a noticeable impact on generalization, so it is rather unlikely that effects of feature diversity are significant enough to counter the opposing effects of universality (we mentioned this briefly in Appendix A.1, but did not provide any data). To be clear, these experiments did not test the limiting case where number of perturbations is equal to number of examples.\n\n To be sure, we ran new experiments, closely following the setup suggested by the reviewer. In particular, we constructed new datasets where each perturbation is applied to exactly once to a unique input. Due to time constraints, we focused on the intermediate datapoints K=4 and K=16 to gauge the trend (note that the construction time increases with K, as we only keep a single example after computing a universal perturbation over K inputs). As we might expect, the generalization increases, but only marginally: for K=4, generalization is 63.5% compared to 61.3%; for K=16, generalization is 38.4%  compared to 34.3% (note that these accuracies are from single training runs so some of the differences can also come from noise). But importantly, the huge gap between K=4 and K=16 persists, showing that generalization indeed decreases with K. \n\n Based on these new experiments, we can extrapolate and be confident that the gap between D_adv and D_univ is still significant after accounting for confounding effects from reduced diversity of training samples.\n\n We thank the reviewer for suggesting ways to make our evaluation more rigorous.\n\n\n2. This is a great observation. However, our setting is quite different from the setting where the learning rate vs batch size scaling behavior is usually studied: here, we are tracking the accuracy (or attack success rate) of a universal perturbation optimized via PGD, whereas for the latter, people look the test accuracy of a model optimized via (minibatch) SGD.\n\n Both settings can be viewed as instances of general gradient-based optimization. While there is some theoretical motivation for this scaling behavior (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06451; https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04623) that applies generally to minibatch SGD optimization, we suspect the behavior breaks down in our setting for the following reasons:\n    - The scaling behavior derivation uses the approximation that N >> B, where N is the total number of examples and B is the batch size; this usually holds when training models on large datasets with typical batch sizes. In contrast, the settings in Figure 8 do not satisfy this; B is in fact roughly on the same order as N (ex. N=128, B=32).\n    - PGD optimization involves projection steps onto the lp ball, and it is not obvious how the analyses for SGD can incorporate this. In particular, the step size of PGD, or the learning rate, is relatively large compared to the lp ball radius, so \u201cboundary effects\u201d may be significant. The original scaling analysis relies on the fidelity of the discretization of the relevant Stochastic Differential Equation with SGD; it is unclear how well this approximation holds in our setting, when accounting for boundary effects.\n\n In any case, the differences pointed to in Figure 8 actually seem to be relatively small in magnitude (which was our point), so we do not think this should be a cause for concern here.\n\n\n3. The focus of this work is to probe the nature of universal perturbations, rather than view them from an attack and defense perspective (like most of the previous works on universal perturbations do). With this goal in mind, we believe that the targeted perturbations are the most natural ones for our study. In particular, they allow us to isolate features (positively) correlated with a particular target. In fact, prior work (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al.) indicates that untargeted universal perturbations generally perturb most examples towards a single common target. So this suggests that they may have similar properties to the targeted universal perturbations. \n\n Also, note that all of the \u201cstandard\u201d adversarial perturbations used in the experiments are also targeted; we are only varying the level of universality in their comparisons. (In Section 5.3, we go further and look at more intermediate interpolations between the two extremes.) \n\n Our analysis of spatial invariance was motivated by the desire to illustrate the difference between universal and standard adversarial perturbations. As the reviewer suggested, one can impose this as an additional constraint when computing adversarial perturbations; this may be another way to \u201crestrict\u201d adversarial perturbations in order to isolate different non-robust features.\n", "title": "Response"}, "Og7DaEtjjME": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Q603bVQjx8f", "comment": "Thank you for the valuable feedback!\n\nWe address each of the concerns below:\n\n1) We agree that defining and measuring human-alignedness is a non-trivial task, as interpretability in general is a hard, and often ill-defined, problem.\n\n That said, as long as we define a particular metric or dimension, we can still measure accordingly to draw meaningful conclusions. We believe that our experiments are well-defined and provide sufficient evidence to support our claims about human-alignedness, at least along the two dimensions we study:  \n\n    - For the first experiment, showing \u201cpredictive signals are localized to semantic patches\u201d, we use normalization and randomization so that the selection of patches is unbiased. Judging visual saliency of the resulting patches inevitably requires human judgement. Given the persistent pattern we have observed, we decided there might be no need for even more rigorous crowd-sourced study, but we would welcome the reviewers perspective on this.\n\n    - For the translation invariance experiment, there is no subjectivity involved at all, as we are measuring models\u2019 accuracies across different (shifted) perturbations; the comparisons are entirely quantitative. If we accept translation invariance as a human-aligned property, then our experiment gives evidence for (significant) differences between universal and regular adversarial perturbations.\n\n We edited our draft to be more consistent and precise in our discussion of semantics and human-alignedness, and we hope that this addresses this useful feedback.\n\n2) We think that improving models\u2019 adversarial robustness or finding better attacks is beyond the scope of this paper. (As we mentioned above, our goal is to probe the nature of non-robust features rather than explore the ML security aspects of this phenomenon.) That said, our study uncovers new aspects of non-robust features, which had been shown to be critically tied to our model\u2019s susceptibility to adversarial examples. We believe that our findings here provide a starting point for improving our understanding of non-robust features (which have remained fairly abstract until now), and that such an understanding is important for building more robust models that rely less on these features.\n\n3) While some previous works have made related observations regarding the semantics of universal perturbation, all of our specific findings are new (*). In particular, as far as we can tell, our focus on using universal perturbations to shed light on non-robust features is a completely new approach. \n\n Re: \u201cWouldn\u2019t universal perturbations be optimized...to contain less non-robust signal.\u201d We agree with this intuition and discuss this in Section 5.3. While our findings here may not be entirely surprising, we find our analysis and its implications to be valuable to improving our understanding of non-robust features.\n\n  (*) In our updated draft, we have added discussion of previous works throughout the paper to clarify connections and comparisons to prior works.\n\n4) Even though we believe that the experiments of Ilyas et al. give strong evidence for existence of non-robust features, we agree that their existence does *not* rule out other reasons that can give rise to adversarial vulnerability. Indeed, follow-up works such as Nakkiran 2019 (https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/response-5/) show that one can find adversarial examples which do not seem to leverage non-robust features. Also, as the reviewer points out, adversarial examples may also arise due to a particular vulnerability of CNN models, or any of the other reasons previously suggested in the literature (high dimensionality, insufficient data, etc.)\n\n Exactly for these reasons, we make sure to not define adversarial perturbations to be non-robust features, and we explicitly take care to distinguish between them throughout writing (for specific definitions, see Preliminaries). In particular, we make sure to emphasize that there\u2019s a distinction between perturbations (which live in the image space, within the perturbation set), and features leveraged by those perturbations (which are functions on the image space).\n\n In any case, we do not assume the existence of non-robust features a priori, and use experiments wherever necessary (e.g. Section 5) to provide evidence.\n\n", "title": "Response"}, "qyC4f2Y4-fG": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "6y3-wzlGHkb", "comment": "We thank all reviewers for their valuable feedback.\n\nWe have uploaded a revised draft with the following changes:\n\n* Overall, we polished the writing significantly.\n\n In particular, we are more consistent and clear in our discussion of semantics and human-alignedness.\n\n* We added material to the Appendices:\n    * A.3.
