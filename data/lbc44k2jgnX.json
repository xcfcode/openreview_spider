One drawback is that it requires the computation of the full gradient at each iteration, an expensive operation if the dimension of the problem is high. We propose a new sampling method: Random Coordinate LMC (RC-LMC). At each iteration, a single coordinate is randomly selected to be updated by a multiple of the partial derivative along this direction plus noise, and all other coordinates remain untouched. We investigate the total complexity of RC-LMC and compare it with the classical LMC for log-concave probability distributions. When the gradient of the log-density is Lipschitz, RC-LMC is less expensive than the classical LMC if the log-density is highly skewed for high dimensional problems, and when both the gradient and the Hessian of the log-density are Lipschitz, RC-LMC is always cheaper than the classical LMC, by a factor proportional to the square root of the problem dimension. In the latter case, our estimate of complexity is sharp with respect to the dimension.

When the log-density of the target distribution is gradient Lipschity and strongly convex, and the step size for updating a coordinate is inversly proportional to the probability of selecting it, the authors show approximate convergence in 2-Wasserstein distance of Random Coordinate LMC (RC-LMC) to the target distribution. The convergence guarantees, in terms of cost, match the ones of classical LMC in terms of dimension and accuracy dependence.\n\nIn the case where all dimensional Lipschitz constants are known, the authors propose a new choice of coordinate selection probability distribution phi and step sizes that yield similar convergence guarantees, but with d^2 kappa dependence replaced by (sum_i kappa_i) where kappa is the global condition number, and kappa_i's are the dimensional condition numbers. Hence, this yields improved convergence guarantees in the case of high dimensional and highly skewed log-density.\n\nIn the case where, in addition, the log-density has a Lipschitz Hessian, and under a proper choice of the coordinate selection distribution phi and step sizes depending on the dimensional gradient and Hessian Lipschitz constants, the authors show convergence of RC-LMC in 2-Wasserstein distance with rate O(d^3/2 epsilon), improving upon the best known rate for this setting.\n\nThe authors show a lower bound for RC-LMC in the gradient and Hessian Lipschitz case, matching the previously shown upper bound. Such a lower bound is appreciated, especially in the literature of Langevin dynamics based sampling algorithm where convergence upper bounds are plentiful and not much is known about lower bounds (especially in the deterministic gradient setting).\n\nFinally, the authors perform a numerical experiment in which they estimate the expectation of some test function of some randome variable following a skewed Gaussian distribution from N samples. They demonstrate that RC-LMC, with our without the knowledge of the dimensional Lipschitz constant, converge faster than classical LMC.\n\nConcerning this experiment, the various methods converge to different saturation thresholds. However, since the objective is strongly log-concave, all methods should converge arbitratily close to the target distribution when choosing the step size small enough (or using a decaying step size). The only limitant factor should then only be due to N being finite, which is common to all methods. Could you please mention and argue upon the choice of step sizes for each method?

When the Hessians are Lipschitz (Case 2 in our paper), RC-LMC always outperforms LMC by a factor of $d^{1/2}$. Since this assumption is quite weak, examples that yield such improvement are abundant. Case 1 concerns case of Lipschitz-continuous gradients, and our study suggests that improvement over LMC can be expected when $d^2\\kappa\\geq \\left(\\sum^d_{i=1}\\kappa_i\\right)^2$. Such is the case for the following example: $f(x)=dx^2_1+\\sum^d_{i=2} x^2_i$,where $\\kappa=\\kappa_1=d$ but $\\kappa_i=1$ for $i\\neq 2$.

Indeed, Xu et al (2018) established the ergodicity of the LMC Markov chain using an argument based on a Lyapunov function. This approach is similar in spirit to our results in Proposition 4.1 and Proposition A.1, where we show the Markov chain property of the SDE (the continuous version of RC-LMC). However, our strategy for the non-asymptotic results (presented in Section 4.2 and 4.3) is quite different --- we use a coupling approach motivated by Dalalyan and Karagulyan (2019). \n    We agree that the paper of Xu et al is closely related to ours, so we have added it to our reference list and provided some brief comments in Remark A.1.\n    \nR3: The cost in Theorem 4.2 depends on the sampling probability for choosing the coordinate. It should be noted that if some $\\phi_i$ is significantly smaller than $1/d$, the total cost may have a worse dependence on dimension.\n\nA3: Good point! According to Theorem 4.2 (which has become Theorem 4.1 in the revised version), RC-LMC might have a worse dependence on dimension if $\\phi_i$ is chosen arbitrarily. This is not surprising: If the sampling strategy runs somehow contrary to the stiffness structure of $f$, then the algorithm essentially wastes too much computational cost to address unimportant directions. But this situation will not arise in a reasonable implementation: If the stiffness structure of $f$ is unknown, one should merely choose $\\phi_i=1/d$. Already, RC-LMC outperforms vanilla LMC for this choice of weights, both for Lipschitz-continuous gradient and Lipschitz-continuous Hessian. Our revised paper clarifies this point, and includes detailed discussions in in Remarks 4.1 and 4.2.\n  \n     \nR4: In the proof of the ergodicity of the Markov chain $X^m$, is it true that both $r$ and $R$ are constants independent of the problem dimension?\n\nA4: Good question. According to a paper in our reference list, by Mattingly, J., Stuart, A., and Higham, D. (2002), both $r$ and $R$ should depend on $d$. So indeed this result, though providing some intuition about the convergence, is significantly weaker than the non-asymptotic convergence results that we show in later subsections. However, this is a result regarding the continuum limit of the algorithm --- the SDE --- not the algorithm itself. Our non-asymptotic analysis for the algorithm itself does come with explicit dependence on all parameters, as shown in Section 4.2 and 4.3. In the revision, we have moved the part of the result concerning the continuous SDE to the appendix,  to avoid confusion and to shed more light on our main results. We have also added Remark A.1 in the revision, as a response to the reviewer's suggestion.\n\nR5: In Theorem 4.1 and Proposition A.1, the authors claim that the stationary distribution of Markov Chain $X^m$ is $p(x)$. I am not sure whether this is correct. Note that $p(x)$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain $X_t$ defined by the SDE in (2). We know that $X^m$ is a discretized chain based on $X_t$. Therefore, as long as the step size is not zero, there will be some discrepancy between these two Markov chains. Thus their stationary distribution could not be the same.\n\nA5: This is a very important point, and we believe there is a misunderstanding here. In our paper $X^m = X(T^m)$, so it is a skeleton of the continuous SDE, but not $x^m$ whose trajectory of course contains some discretization error compared with the SDE. The notational similarity between $X^m$ and $x^m$ and possibly led to a misunderstanding.\n     \nThe stationary distribution for $x^m$ is indeed not $p(x)$, exactly as what the reviewer suggests, but the stationary distribution for $X^m$ is in fact $p(x)$. The proof is given in Appendix A, where we need to analyze the SDE (7), instead of its discrete version (5).", "title": "Response to the reviewer"}, "690BiJB-Mgs": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "AIaCOKT9z13", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Based on our reading of the reviewer's comments, we believe there are some misunderstandings, potentially because the introduction of the paper did not stress enough some important factors. We have revised the manuscript in a way that (we hope) clarifies matters for the reviewer and addresses the concerns.\n\nWe stress four main points:\n\n1. Regarding the performance of the method: We do not agree with the reviewer's comment stating that the new method (RC-LMC) does not outperform the current method. \nIn fact, in both cases that we study (Lipschitz-continuous gradient and Lipschitz-continuous Hessian), the new method (RC-LMC) outperforms the vanilla LMC. In the former case, a certain stiffness structure is needed to obtain improvement, whereas in the latter case, RC-LMC reduces the cost by  $d^{1/2}$ , regardless of the stiffness structure of the problem.\nWe believe the latter case reflects a very strong advantage of RC-LMC over vanilla LMC, which is not seen in comparing RCD with GD. This property seems to be unique to the sampling setting.\nWe have revised the introduction to stress these advantages towards the end and further discussed in detail the comparison in Remark 4.1 and 4.2 for the two settings. \n\n2. Regarding the cost of computing the gradient: The reviewer also commented on the cost of computing the gradient vs. computing partial derivatives. We agree that there are certainly models in which the whole gradient can be computed efficiently using appropriate techniques, such as automatic differentiation, as we mention in the paper. In such cases, the advantage of RC-LMC is not evident. However, there are also many interesting applications in which the cost of calculating the gradient is indeed approximately $d$ times the cost of computing one partial derivative. ERM (empirical risk minimization) problems (not discussed in the paper) and PDE-based inverse problems (we listed a few examples in the paper) are in this category. The graph example mentioned in the paper is another such illustration.\nWe are well aware of this consideration about coordinate descent, which arises also in the optimization setting.\nVarious forms of CD remain popular in optimization and machine learning because of their practicality on problems such as those mentioned in the previous paragraph. In Bayesian sampling, Gibbs sampling (which can be viewed as a coordinate algorithm) also  relies on per-dimension updates being cheap. The wide popularity of these methods indicate the potential applications of the method proposed in our work. \n\n3. Regarding the stiffness structure: It seems that the reviewer believes the prior knowledge of the stiffness structure is needed for RC-LMC to outperform LMC.  In fact, RC-LMC can outperform LMC even without detailed knowledge of Lipschitz constants. The uniform-sampling choice $\\phi_i = 1/d$ already gives RC-LMC an advantage, in terms of complexity.  If Lipschitz constants are known, the optimal sampling strategy yields an even greater advantage for RC-LMC.  We discuss these points in Remarks 4.1 and 4.2.\n\n4. Regarding the paper by Tong-Morzfeld-Marzouk: We thank the reviewer for mentioning the reference. The setting of their work is quite different from ours.\n  1 In (X.T. Tong), the algorithm updates coordinates in a specific order, not randomly. As a result, the analysis of the algorithms are also quite different. (The same is true in the optimization setting, where the analysis of cyclic CD is quite different from analysis of randomized CD.)\n   2 The assumption in (X.T. Tong) is very different from ours as well. In their paper, $f$ is of low rank, strongly convex, with the gradient $\\nabla f$ bounded. Our work considers a more classical setting in sampling literature (for example when classical LMC is analyzed): $f$ strongly convex with Lipschitz gradient $\\nabla f$.  \nThere is certainly a relationship with this paper, so we  have added the reference and some corresponding discussion at the end of Section 1.\n\nIn summary, Random coordinate descent (RCD) is a very popular optimization method, and it is shown to outperform GD (Wright, S. J. (2015) in the reference list) in some regimes. Our work  serves as a parallel discussion in the sampling setup. To our great surprise, the advantage of RC-LMC over LMC is significantly stronger than that of RCD over GD. When Hessian is Lipschitz, RC-LMC  wins by a factor of at least $d^{1/2}$. \n\nWe hope that our explanations and revisions have addressed the referee's concerns.
