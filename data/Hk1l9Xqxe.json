It can be a powerful tool for the preservation of ecological diversity. We investigate probabilistic models to analyse signals issued from real-world bioacoustic sound scenes. We study a Bayesian non-parametric sequential models based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The model is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals. This paper illustrates the potential of chunking non-human animal signals into structured parts. This can yield to a new species representation and help experts to better understand the behaviour of such species as Kershenbaum et al. (2014) wanted.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper studies an unusual and (apparently) challenging application -- segmentation of whale and bird songs. Though the authors claim that the applications is much more challenging than previous applications of the proposed techniques (in speech processing), the evaluation is very questionable (as there is no gold standard), there is no convincing comparison with other (potentially simpler techniques).

Fox et al. (2007, 2009) for dynamical systems including speech recognition problems (speaker  diarization). However, we think that the problem of bioacoustic signals analysis is much more challenging compared standard speech recognition problems, since the data heterogeneity comes from different complex and unknown sources (unknown species, unknown dynamics for each species, mixed species, etc), things which are not common for speech recognition models and for which flexible and completely unsupervised and non-parametric models are needed. This is we think what is offered by the HDP-HMM algorithm. On the other hand, we agree with you that in Bayesian analysis in general, the problem of choosing the hyper-parameter is ans issue. But we wish to argue that here the aspect of the flexibility of the model is privileged, for a reasonable computing time, regarding the one of choosing the hyper-parameters for which a solid experimental protocol is need, and thus leads to a strong computational load, especially in this large-scale context. But we are of course concious that this job mus be done, but is stated as a future work for which current phd students are already working on.", "title": "Response on novelty and initialization"}, "rJbuoMvQl": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Hk1l9Xqxe", "review": "What is a novel aspect of this technique?
