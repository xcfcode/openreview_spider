Investigating what features of a dataset and its underlying distribution a model decodes may enlighten the mysterious \"black box\" and guide us to a deeper and more profound understanding of the ongoing processes. Furthermore, it will help to improve the quality of models which directly depend on data or learn from it through training. In this work, we introduce the dataset-dependent concept of sample robustness, which is based on a point-wise Lipschitz constant of the label map. For a particular sample, it measures how small of a perturbation is required to cause a label-change relative to the magnitude of the label map. We introduce theory to motivate the concept and to analyse the effects of having similar robustness distributions for the training- and test data. Afterwards, we conduct various experiments using different datasets and (non-)deterministic models.

It would have been more satisfactory had some supporting theoretical results been provided for the proposed notion.\n-\tThe grammar and quality of writing can be improved at many places.\n-\tIn Table 3, it seems that training on the complete training set gives the best loss/accuracy when tested on the complete test set (compared to when we train on subsets of the data). But then, what is the benefit here of training on a (least/most robust) subset of the training data? No explanation is provided in this regard.\n-\tIn Table 4 as well, downsizing x drastically increases the loss on the complete test t. However, in Table 6 (KNN), choosing the 40,000 most robust training samples gives the best accuracy on t.

As this work was intended to be an introduction, we only used the minimal setup of two different datasets to cover a classification- and regression setup. We intended to motivate readers to investigate the proposed concept in the future. However, as other reviews mentioned as well, the lack of additional theory caused our work to solely rely on this empirical data. Therefore, by adding such theory in the updated version, we hope to give a more convincing introduction.\n\n3.

The novelty of our work is not connecting Lipschitz calculus to robustness in general, but using this connection to analyse the robustness of datasets and its relation to model performance. Nonetheless, the lack of a theoretical motivation only allows for an empirical focus of our work and the reporting of experiments without proper explanations. Therefore, we have added two new sections in the updated version discussing our original motivation for this concept and natural relationships with KNN models.\n\n2.

As mentioned by other reviewers as well, our work lacks the theoretic motivation for the proposed concept of sample robustness. Furthermore, it seemed overly simplistic and may not convince a reader (there may be many equivalent choices). Indeed, sample robustness is merely a normalised point-wise Lipschitz constant of the label map. However, this is exactly what we intended to create in the first place, i.e. an accessible measure of data-robustness that only depends on the data itself. To give it a more theoretical basis, we have added a corresponding section in the updated version explaining our original motivation behind it. Furthermore, we have worked out the particular relationships of our concept to KNN models.\n\n2. We did rewrite almost all paragraphs to enable a better reading flow.\n\n3. The best performance on the whole test set ist achieved using the whole training set. The critical insight here, however, is that for the least- and most robust subsets of the test data, the model can achieve better performances (compared to the baseline) by using only 80% of the training set. It shows, for example, that such a model can generalise better on less robust data when trained on such data. One can therefore benefit from a collection of expert-models, each trained on a subset of different robustness.\n\n4. Table. 4 indicates that there exists a model-dependent trade-off between (i) aligning robustness distributions by downsizing the training data and (ii) the overall ability of a model to generalise from the smaller set of samples. For KNN, we have provided additional theoretic relations and an explanation of precisely these results in the updated version. We attribute the outcome to the elimination of natural adversarial examples.\n\n\nFurther remarks:\n- We used the correct writing now.\n- The algorithms are moved to the appendix as they build on additional theoretic results (also noted in the appendix).\n- We did use the most- and least robust subsets to amplify any noticeable effect. \n\nAgain, we want to express our gratitude towards reviewer 1 for the provided criticism and remarks.

The reviewers rightfully criticised the present emphasis on experiments without a proper theory explaining these. More so, the few mathematical notions used to introduce sample robustness failed to motivate the purpose of the concept itself and seemed rather \"ad hoc\". To this end, we provided a thorough theoretical discussion of what motivated us to consider the robustness of samples initially. We also mentioned a trade-off between aligning robustness distributions and the ability of a model to generalise. Furthermore, we added a short paragraph discussing the relations between sample robustness and KNN models. With these additions to our current work, we then explained the empirical results and worked out similarities between the classification- and regression setup.\n\nAnother point of criticism was the general language style which decreased readability significantly.

They do so by taking the pointwise Lipschitz constant of the label map and normalizing it by the label norm. The authors show that training on samples that are / are not sensitive helps on a test set that is / is not sensitive. \n\nPositives:\n\nThe authors do extensive experimentation to evaluate the effect of training with various data subsets constructed by taking the most or least sensitive samples, and testing on other subsets of sensitive / not sensitive samples.\n\nThe results generally show that performance on non-sensitive subsets improves when training with non-sensitive data.\n\nNegatives:\n\nI'm not terribly convinced by the experimental results. It seems like the conclusion of the paper is that if the goal is to get good performance on the standard test set, you should just use the original data without taking into account sample robustness.\n\nThere are gains for specific subsets, but the paper doesn't really do a good job of convincing me why I should care about this. It seems like the end goal should be performance on whatever test set I originally collected, and not a subset where you remove particular hard or easy examples. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that the train and test data selection procedures are matched (i.e. you select points based on sample robustness and evaluate on similar selection criteria). \n\nFinally, I'm not sure if this notion of sample robustness is conceptually novel compared to methods like adversarial pruning (Yang 2019). The authors could have done more in linking the effects of sample robustness to the margin or generalization properties of the resulting classifier. For an example of such discussion see the recent line of work on r-consistency and nonparametric methods for adversarial robustness.\n\nFinally, the writing style is generally convoluted and requires substantial effort to parse. The abstract sentence starting with \"In this work\" and first sentence of the intro are both examples of this.
