However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a  very large collection (i.e. active learning).\n\nOur empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs when applied in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as core-set selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization.

THe additional experiments are a good addition.\n\n************************\nThe authors provide an algorithm-agnostic active learning algorithm for multi-class classification. The core technique is to construct a coreset of points whose labels inform the labels of other points.  The coreset construction requires one to construct a set of  points which can cover the entire dataset. While this is NP-hard problem in general, the greedy algorithm is 2-approximate. The authors use a variant of the greedy algorithm along with bisection search to solve a series of feasibility problems to obtain a good cover of the dataset each time.  This cover tells us which points are to be queried. The reason why choosing the cover is a good idea is because under suitable Lipschitz continuity assumption the generalization error can be controlled via an appropriate value of the covering radius in the data space.  The authors use the coreset construction with a CNN to demonstrate an active learning algorithm for multi-class classification. \nThe experimental results are convincing enough to show that it outperforms other active learning algorithms. However, I have a few major and minor comments.\n\nMajor comments:\n\n1. The proof of Lemma 1 is incomplete. We need the Lipschitz constant of the loss function. The loss function is a function of the CNN function and the true label. The proof of lemma 1 only establishes the Lipschitz constant of the CNN function. Some more extra work is needed to derive the lipschitz constant of the loss function from the CNN function. \n\n2. The statement of Prop 1 seems a bit confusing to me. the hypothsis says that the loss on the coreset = 0. But the equation in proposition 1 also includes the loss on the coreset. Why is this term included. Is this term not equal to 0?\n\n3. Some important works are missing.  Especially works related to pool based active learning, and landmark results on labell complexity of agnostic active learning.\nUPAL: Unbiased Pool based active learning by Ganti & Gray. http://proceedings.mlr.press/v22/ganti12/ganti12.pdf\nEfficient active learning of half-spaces by Gonen et al. http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/gonen13a/gonen13a.pdf\nA bound on the label complexity of agnostic active learning. http://www.machinelearning.org/proceedings/icml2007/papers/375.pdf\n\n4.  The authors use L_2 loss as their objective function. This is a bit of a weird choice given that they are dealing with multi-class classification and the output layer is a sigmoid layer, making it a natural fit to work with something like a cross-entropy loss function. I guess the theoretical results do not extend to cross-entropy loss, but the authors do not mention these points anywhere in the paper. For example, the ladder network, which is one of the networks used by the authors is a network that uses cross-entropy for training.\n\nMinor-comment: \n1. The feasibility program in (6) is an MILP. However, the way it is written it does not look like an MILP. It would have been great had the authors mentioned that u_j \\in {0,1}. \n\n2. The authors write on page 4, \"Moreover, zero training error can be enforced by converting average loss into maximal loss\". It is not clear to me what the authors mean here. For example, can I replace the average error in proposition 1, by maximal loss? Why can I do that? Why would that result in zero training error?\n\nOn the whole this is interesting work and the results are very nice. But, the proof for Lemma 1 seems incomplete to me, and some choices (such as choice of loss function) are unjustified. Also, important references in active learning literature are missing.", "title": "This is interesting work and the results are very nice.

It is happy to see such paper in the field. This paper proposes a batch mode active learning algorithm for CNN as a core-set problem. The authors provide an upper bound of the core-set loss, which is the gap between the training loss on the whole set and the core-set. By minimizing this upper bound, the problem becomes a K-center problem which can be solved by using a greedy approximation method, 2-OPT. The experiments are performed on image classification problem (CIFAR, CALTECH, SVHN datasets), under either supervised setting or weakly-supervised setting. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the random sampling and uncertainty sampling by a large margin. Moreover, the authors show that 2-OPT can save tractable amount of time in practice with a small accuracy drop.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is new and writing is clear. However, the paper is not flawless. The proposed active learning framework is under ERM and cover-set, which are currently not supported by deep learning. To validate such theoretical result, a non-deep-learning model should be adopted. The ERM for active learning has been investigated in the literature, such as \"Querying discriminative and representative samples for batch mode active learning\" in KDD 2013, which also provided an upper bound loss of the batch mode active learning and seems applicable for the problem in this paper. Another interesting question is most of the competing algorithm is myoptic active learning algorithms. The comparison is not fair enough.

Our theoretical study shows that the construction of the coreset for CNNs requires solving the k-Center problem as a sub-routine. Hence, we (approximately) solve the k-Center problem.

We appreciate the encouraging comments. We address the concerns as follows:\n\nMajor Points:\n1) Proof of Lemma 1: The reviewer is right as the current proof of the Lemma 1 is incomplete. Proposition 1 only requires the loss function to be a Lipschitz continuous function of the x(input data point) for a fixed true label (y) and parameters (w). Current proof of the Lemma 1 indeed proves this more restrictive but sufficient statement. Hence, we re-stated the Lemma 1 correctly in the updated submission.

We clarified this in the updated text\n\n3)We updated the related work with the suggested references.\n\n4) L_2 loss: We agree that this is unconventional as cross-entropy is the widely accepted choice of loss function for classification problems. We use L_2 loss for theoretical simplicity and used cross-entropy in the experiments. The experimental results suggest that our method is effective for cross-entropy loss as well. We explicitly discussed and clarified this choice in the updated submission.\n\nMinor Points:\n1)MILP: We added the missing constraint -u_j \\in {0,1}- in the updated submission\n2)Maximal Loss: We agree that this is a confusing statement and we removed it in the updated submission. What we meant was although 0 training error on core-set is a hard assumption, it can be directly enforced by using the maximal loss while learning the model. However, we did not use any such trick.\n\nWe hope that the updated version answer the reviewer's concerns.

The work by Yang et al. is not tractable for CNNs since it requires inversion of a very large matrix (number of data points by number of datapoints). The work by Yu et al. only applies to linear regression case with Gaussian noise assumption. Work by Demir et al. is indeed partially applicable to CNNs and we implemented and experimented with it. We also implemented the suggested k-Median baseline. Since both methods performed similarly, we only include k-Median in the experimental results in the updated submission. We also added another batch active learning baseline (Zheng Wang and Jieping Ye. Querying discriminative and representative samples for batch mode\nactive learning. ACM TKDD 2015.)\n\nk-Median method turns out to be NOT effective for batch-mode deep learning. This is rather intuitive since the pool size is significantly larger than the query budget in all our experiments. For such a case, cluster centers happen to be around the modes of the data distribution. However, the important requirement of the query selection method is sampling the tails of the distribution instead.  Moreover, the neighborhood of such cluster centers are likely to be sampled in the initial labelled pool since they are near modes. Hence, clustering based methods fail for very large pool and a rather small budget case. Distribution matching based batch active learning baseline (Wang&Ye 2015) also fails since it heavily uses uncertainty information and treating soft-max probabilities as confidence values is misleading. We updated the text accordingly.\n\n3) By that statement we meant, both oracle uncertainty and Bayesian estimation of uncertainty performs better than empirical uncertainty baseline. Hence, they are helpful improvements over empirical uncertainty baseline but still not effective when compared with random sampling. We clarified the claim in the updated version.\n ", "title": "Implemented the suggested baseline and added the suggested references"}}}
