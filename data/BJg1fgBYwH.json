However, SNN based on pure STDP learning have yet to show comparable performance as DNN, in particular for complex datasets like ImageNet. More recently, there have been many efforts in realizing supervised training in SNN via back propagation; which can achieve comparable performance as DNN. These prior works on SNN-DNN conversion focus on generating a deep network with spiking activation function (primarily to save energy) but does not have unsupervised learning. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first effort in creating a hybrid network that successfully couples supervised training in DNN with local unsupervised learning in SNN in a single architecture. Note, the hybrid network presented here is not a simple cascade of SNN and DNN where SNN acts as a pre-processor. Instead, we propose a tighter coupling of the two by integrating features learned via STDP and features trained using SGD into a single model. The unsupervised learning presented here goes beyond traditional STDP. We present an innovative frequency dependent stochastic STDP formulation that improves ability of the network to extract features that are robust to local perturbation. The additional results are added to illustrate this advantage. The local and cross-depth inhibition, a relatively new concept in the STDP-based learning, has also been incorporated. \n\nAfter the STDP-learning is completed for the SNN component, we present a new conversion approach, where the SNN architecture is converted to an equivalent DNN, by (i) removing input spike generation, (ii) re-scaling of weights, and (iii) converting the spiking activation function to a special activation function. The conversion allows the hybrid network to be trained as a DNN preserving the accuracy for baseline images. \n\nIn summary, in contrast to prior works on ANN to SNN conversion that essentially create an SGD-trained deep SNN with spiking activation; this paper creates a final hybrid network that behaves as a regular DNN during inference but hybridizes STDP and SGD during training to enhance learning capability of the network.\n\n>>Method of choice for noise-robust computer vision\n\nThe noise-robust classification can be achieved using two complementary approaches: (i) pre-processing the input via de-noising networks, and (ii) improving robustness of the classification network against input perturbation. SAFE-DNN is an approach for (ii) and can be integrated with techniques for (i) as SAFE_DNN does not degrade accuracy for clean images. \n\nWe acknowledge that using deep learning techniques for image de-noising is a well-studied area, and many of them show very good performance for arbitrary noise structures. However, de-noising adds a new stage in the processing pipeline increasing the overall latency. Moreover, for light-weight de-noising networks, if there is a significant difference between noise structure during training and inference the quality degrades (Na et. al., Xie et. al). Also, as de-noising changes the input structure, it can degrade accuracy for clean images. Advanced networks have been proposed to generalize well for different noise levels but their complexity is high increasing complexity of the overall system. In contrast, SAFE-DNN introduces negligible overhead. For example, even a lightweight de-noising network shown by Na, et. al., the overhead is 2.5 times more parameters (0.187M versus 0.07M).\n\nThe direct comparison of SAFE-DNN will be with other approaches for (ii), for example, networks trained with noisy images as presented in the paper. In that sense, SAFE-DNN learns to become robust without ever being trained on the noisy images which ensures the network is easily generalized to very different noise structures. We have added additional results in the paper to clearly demonstrate the ability of the network to show robustness to noise of different magnitude and structures. This is the most important advantage of SAFE-DNN over noise-trained DNNs. \n\nWe note that, the proposed network is not in conflict with pre-processing techniques such as de-noising DNNs, meaning that SAFE-DNN can be considered as an addition to de-noising. We are currently implementing advanced de-noising networks into our pipeline to show how an integrated pre-processing + SAFE-DNN will perform, and new results will be added to the final paper, if accepted. \n\nTaesik Na, et. al.

During inference, the hybrid network acts as a DNN and shows better classification accuracy for clean images, as well as improved robustness against input perturbation (noise). To the best of our knowledge, this is first ever demonstration of a DNN, where hybridization of STDP and SGD is performed during training. \n\n>>Comparison to De-noising\n\nPlease see response to reviewer #2 on the qualitative comparison with de-noising network as well as noise-trained DNNs. \n\n>>Scope of the Input Noise Type\n\nWe conducted more experiments on other noise distributions including: Wald, Poisson, and Salt-and-pepper. Moreover, based on the reviewer\u2019s suggestion we have also included adversarial noise generated via black-box attack. The results are included in the revised paper, and showed that SAFE-DNN, trained only on clean images, show appreciable robustness to different types of noise structures and magnitude. \n\n>>Relation to adversarial noise and \u201cattacks\u201d\n\nThe paper is primarily focused on noise or perturbation in the input image that can occur naturally, for example, due to sensor hardware or capturing environment. We acknowledge that there also exists targeted perturbations such as adversarial attacks. We have included new test results considering adversarial noise generated via black-box attack methods and demonstrated that SAFE-DNN can improve robustness to adversarial noise as well. \n\nWe would like to stress that the paper does not claim to address the domain of adversarial attack. In particular, current form of SAFE-DNN is vulnerable to white-box attack, as it is possible to extract gradient information from the SAFE-DNN architecture. That being said, the well-studied defense methods such as adversarial training can, in principle, be adapted for STDP learning and deep network training stage, which can improve robustness against white-box attack. However, designing a SAFE-DNN for adversarial attack requires complementary efforts including extensive studies and experimental results, and is outside the scope of the current paper.\n", "title": "Reply to Review #2"}, "Bkef03NniS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rygtIBsQ5S", "comment": "Thank you for your review. \n\n>> Novelty in Combining STDP and CNN. \n\nWe agree (and like) that the concept is simple where STDP-learned and SGD-trained features are combined to provide improved classification performance under input perturbation. However, as mentioned in the previous response, this was achieved through innovation in (i) STDP algorithm to improved robustness against input perturbation; and (ii) hybridization to seamlessly integrate STDP-learned features into the DNN pipeline during training and inference. It is important to realize that the hybrid network behaves as a DNN during inference and there are no spiking neurons during inference. \n\n>> Explanation of the noise robustness of SNN learned features: \n\nWe have improved section 3 and hope it provides a better reasoning for the robustness of low level features extracted by SNN. \n\nWe are intrigued by the reviewer\u2019s question on whether a normal CNN trained using methods other than back propagation will show similar noise robustness or not. In principle, we feel an alternative to back-propagation that does not distribute errors globally during training may achieve a similar objective; however, at this point we do not have any empirical evidence and quantitative result to prove (or dis-prove) this hypothesis.        \n\n>> What kind of input noise are we considering in the analysis?\n\nThe initial paper considered pixel level noise modeled as a Gaussian variable. \n\n>> Experiments are only tested under one kind of random perturbation with different strengths. I think it will be better if the algorithm can consistently improve over various kinds of noise distributions. \n\nWe conducted more experiments on other noise distributions including: Wald, Poisson and salt-and-pepper.

The results are included in the revised paper, and showed that SAFE-DNN, trained only on clean images, show appreciable robustness to different types of noise structures and  magnitude. \n\n>> It is mentioned in the introduction that some methods were proposed to filter out the input noise, but they are not compared in the experiments. \n\nWe have considered one popular approach for noise removal (model-based), namely, average filtering. As observed, the filtering helps for noisy images but significantly degrade the quality for clean images. Please see the response to reviewer #3 on the qualitative discussions on SAFE-DNN versus input denoising. \n\n>>What's the training time of the proposed method? \n\nWe have included training time for both SNN and SAFE-DNN implementations in section 4: \u201c\u2026 for CIFAR10, using a desktop machine with Intel Core i7-7700K and two NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPUs, SNN simulation takes 265 minutes.

In the hybrid network, learned feature is the concatenation of traditionally supervised-ly learned features and those from an auxiliary\u00a0module trained locally and unsupervised-ly by STDP. The new network demonstrates improved noise robustness via improved classification accuracy on Cifar10 and ImageNet subset when input data have noise, on different network architectures.\n\nThe paper, however, fails to address the many works in the literature about adversarial perturbations ('attack') and adversarial training ('defense'), starting by\u00a0(Szegedy et al., 2013). The different types of attacks\u00a0affect the efficiency\u00a0of defense due to the game-theoretical nature of the adversarial perturbation\u00a0problem. If the attack is blind to the classification model, e.g., Gaussian attack by adding Gaussian noise, then image restoration\u00a0techniques like denoising could provide an effective 'defense'. Thus model-specific attacks are of more application interest than model-blind ones. The current manuscript did not address the specific noise type being used to perturb the image. It is unlikely that the local learning techniques proposed in the paper can work on many kinds of perturbations especially the 'attacks' which is model specific.\u00a0\n\nThe proposed methodology is a feature concatenation of local (low-level) features of image data and deep features.
