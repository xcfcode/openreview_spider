However, wavelength-dependent light attenuation and back-scattering result in color distortion and haze effect, which degrade the visibility of images. To address this problem, firstly, we proposed an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images (color distortion and haze effect simulation) from in-air image and depth map pairs. Secondly, U-Net, which is trained efficiently using synthetic underwater dataset, is adopted for color restoration and de-hazing. Our model directly reconstructs underwater clear images using end-to-end autoencoder networks, while maintaining scene content structural similarity. The results obtained by our method were compared with existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Experimental results on open real-world underwater datasets demonstrate that the presented method performs well on different actual underwater scenes, and the processing speed can reach up to 125FPS on images running on one NVIDIA 1060 GPU.", "keywords": ["underwater image", "image restoration", "image enhancement", "GAN", "CNNs"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper proposed to improve the quality of underwater images, specifically color distortion and haze effect, by an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN).

Thus I stay my original score.\n\n\n[Original reviews]\nThis paper proposed an unsupervised generative adversarial network for underwater generating realistic underwater images and haze removal, which can simultaneously deal with the color restoration and haze in the realistic underwater environment.\n\nFirstly, according to the widely used physical model in the image processing area, employed the UnderwaterGAN to trained parameters in advanced, and then use U-Net for color restoration and haze removal of underwater images. However, many existing works used the physical model to represent the imaging principles and using deep network to learn prior knowledge. Thus, I think the proposed idea is a little bit incremental.\n\nFor the experimental part, the experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the ablation studies in the appendix also give us the intuition by using the different loss functions. Also, I suggest the authors demonstrate the proposed method on not only low-level, but also high-level vision tasks, e.g., underwater image target detection. \n\nFinally, the paper is well organized and sentence expression is also clear, but small errors that are correctable. \n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 4}, "SJx8OG8Fsr": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Skl-8kPxjr", "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out some problems in our work.

This is not a valid assumption for the MHL dataset, so our restored images still show some vignetting though it is partially corrected.\u201d, This sentence is mentioned in the original paper of WaterGAN (In page 6, above VI. Conclusion). It is our mistake to call vignetting model as camera model in Introduction part.\n\nIn order to solve the color noise problem, noise vector z is no longer necessary in our UWGAN model, UWGAN takes color image and its depth map as input, so our model can avoid color noise problem.
