Recent breakthrough work by Khemakhem et al. (2019) on nonlinear ICA has answered this question for a broad class of conditional generative processes. We extend this important result in a direction relevant for application to real-world data. First, we generalize the theory to the case of unknown intrinsic problem dimension and prove that in some special (but not very restrictive) cases, informative latent variables will be automatically separated from noise by an estimating model. Furthermore, the recovered informative latent variables will be in one-to-one correspondence with the true latent variables of the generating process, up to a trivial component-wise transformation. Second, we introduce a modification of the RealNVP invertible neural network architecture (Dinh et al. (2016)) which is particularly suitable for this type of problem: the General Incompressible-flow Network (GIN). Experiments on artificial data and EMNIST demonstrate that theoretical predictions are indeed verified in practice. In particular, we provide a detailed set of exactly 22 informative latent variables extracted from EMNIST.", "keywords": ["disentanglement", "nonlinear ICA", "representation learning", "feature discovery", "theoretical justification"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Spotlight)", "comment": "This paper builds on the recent theoretical work by Khemakhem et al.

This is one of the reasons why we prefer invertible neural networks / normalizing flows over VAEs, as in such models, the dimension of the latent space is necessarily the same as the dimension of the data, in order to preserve bijectivity. Therefore, we never choose the dimension of the model\u2019s latent space, so in this context, an experiment where the latent space is too small is not possible. \n\nRegarding the magnitude of the standard deviations of noise dimensions: we have added a section (3.3) explaining the role of volume-preservation in our model. Since the EMNIST data set is relatively noise-free, noise does not play a large role in explaining the data, hence we expect it to also play a small role in the derived latent space, quantified by its standard deviation.

The latter work provides an extension of the basic nonlinear ICA that is closely related to a VAE with a conditional factorized prior, essentially introducing side information (with assumed extra observables u) to resolve non-identifiability issues. \n\nThis paper proposes an invertible architecture related to RealNVP and NICE, coined as  GIN: the General Incompressible-flow network. \n\nOn the positive side,\n\nA key feature of the proposed methodology is model selection (such as determining the model order) that is in general a hard problem even in linear latent variable models. \nThe performance is illustrated on the EMNIST dataset, as well as carefully constructed synthetic experiments. The semantic descriptions of each captured dimension, as detailed in the appendix, is particularly interesting. \nThe experimental section is quite extensive. \n\nOn the negative side, \n\nThe paper is largely based on the results of a recent technical report (Khemakhem et al.

This is tackling an important problem in the field of generative modeling, where one would like to extract the generative factors of a dataset that independently control its features (i.e. disentanglement).\n\nThe paper is very clearly written, does a great job at motivating the problem and presenting the recent results from Khemakhem et al, before extending them with some simple theorems and demonstrating their application on toy data + EMNIST.\nI think that this research direction is extremely promising, and obtaining a theoretical understanding of when/why disentangling could work would be particularly valuable to the field, and I would lean towards acceptance so that this work gets more attention.\n\nIt is slightly surprising however that their empirical results seem to indicate that these theoretical conditions do not seem to be necessary, which should be investigated further (and might help illustrate the dichotomy in some claims and results obtained in the disentangling literature recently).\n\n1.\tIt was unclear to me how one should/would decide what to use for $u$ or what to leave out to be factorized by the method. \n\tThis may be out of scope for this current work, but one way to answer that would be to leverage datasets with more fully labelled factorised data (e.g. dSprites [1]) and present how one should leverage these with $u$, in order to identify the original generative factors.\n2.\tRelated, using EMNIST was interesting, but given the lack of \u201caccepted\u201d generative factors to be recovered, it is hard to tell if the 22 variables found are \u201ccorrect\u201d or more similar to using a generative model which would entangled the data more (and hence would falsely introduce extra latent variables).\n3.\tThe toy dataset, with its random RealNVP network to produce the data, was less \u201cmixed\u201d than I expected, looking at Figure 2B. In its projected view, the clusters are still rather easy to identify by eye, which surprised me somehow? Could you comment a bit more on how difficult is the task, or present a VAE baseline that would fail to explain that data?\n4.\tI did not see how the threshold for selecting 22 latent variables on EMNIST was set? Was the 23rd latent variable significantly less informative? The spectrum on Figure 3A was not precise enough to assess this fairly and the single mention of \u201cmeasured by the standard deviations of test data transformed to the latent space\u201d was too vague to reverse-engineer the decision.\n5.\tIt was interesting to read about the observations of when this method should fail. It would be interesting if a dataset with explicit \u201cgaps\u201d would be constructed to analyze this case.\n6.\tFigure 4 might benefit from mentioning \u201cwhat\u201d each variable controls for directly in their individual caption / on top of them, instead of having to read this through in the full figure caption.\n7.\tThe current model in the end is modeling the latent state using a mixture of gaussians (although these now have a theoretical connection to the true generative factors). How much does this differ to existing generative models using VAEs with a mixture of gaussian prior [2, 3]?\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] dSprites dataset: https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset \n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02648\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03717\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #4", "rating": "8: Accept", "confidence": 4}}}
