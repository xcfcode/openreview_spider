This is then used to develop a simple bias initialization scheme for the gates when the range of temporal dependencies relevant for a problem can be estimated or are known. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed initialization speeds up learning on synthetic tasks, although benefits for next-step prediction tasks are limited.\n\nQuality and significance:\nThe core insight of the paper is the link between recurrent network design and its effect on how the network reacts to time transformations. This insight is simple, elegant and valuable in my opinion. \n\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent recently that the benefits of the gating and cell mechanisms introduced by the LSTM, now also used in feedforward networks, go beyond avoiding vanishing gradients. The particular structural elements also induce certain inductive biases which make learning or generalization easier in many cases. Understanding the link between model architecture and behavior is very useful for the field in general, and this paper contributes to this knowledge. In light of this, I think it is reasonable to ignore the fact that the proposed initialization does not provide benefits on Penn Treebank and text8. The real value of the paper is in providing an alternative way of thinking about LSTMs that is theoretically sound and intuitive. \n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-written in general and easy to understand. A minor complaint is that there are an unnecessarily large number of paragraph breaks, especially on pages 3 and 4, which make reading slightly jarring.", "title": "A simple and important insight about LSTMs", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "rk10EE5Vf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJcKhk-Ab", "comment": "A generalization analysis, along with a curve showing precision vs warp range, with warps longer than those seen during training was added to the appendix.", "title": "Generalization analysis"}, "HyqtEE54z": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hyb2BDI4G", "comment": "The generalization analysis, along with a curve showing precision vs warp range, with warps longer than those seen during training was added.

I have always been a skeptic wrt LSTM, since I myself did not fully understand when to prefer them over vanilla RNNs for reasons other than \u201cthey empirically work much better in many domains.\u201d and \u201cthey are less prone to vanishing gradients\u201d. \n\nSection 1 is a bliss: it provides a very useful candidate explanation under which conditions vanilla RNNs fail (or at least, do not efficiently generalise) in contrast to gated cells. I am sincerely happy about the write up and will point many people to it.\n\nThe major problem with the paper, in my eyes, is the lack of experiments specific to test the hypothesis. Obviously, quite a bit of effort has gone into the experimental section. The focus however is comparison to the state of the art in terms of raw performance.  \n\nThat leaves me asking: are gated RNNs superior to vanilla RNNs if the data is warped?\nWell, I don\u2019t know now. I only can say that there is reason to believe so. \n\nI *really* do encourage the authors to go back to the experiments and see if they can come up with an experiment to test the main hypothesis of the paper. E.g. one could make synthetic warpings, apply it to any data set and test if things work out as expected. Such a result would in my opinion be of much more use than the tiny increment in performance that is the main output of the paper as of now, and which will be stomped by some other trick in the months to come. It would be a shame if such a nice theoretical insight got under the carpet because of that. E.g. today we hold [Pascanu 2013] dear not because of the proposed method, but because of the theoretical analysis.\n\nSome minor points.\n- The authors could make use of less footnotes, and try to incorporate them into the text or appendix.\n- A table of results would be nice.\n- Some choices of the experimental section seem arbitrary, e.g. the use of optimiser and to not use clipping of gradients. In general, the evaluation of the hyper parameters is not rigorous.\n- \u201cabruplty\u201d -> \u201cabruptly\u201d on page 5, 2nd paragraph\n\n### References\n[Pascanu 2013] Pascanu, Razvan, Tomas Mikolov, and Yoshua Bengio. \"On the difficulty of training recurrent neural networks.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2013.", "title": "Cool theoretical contribution with rather unrelated experiments", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "HkIzPXqxM": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SJcKhk-Ab", "review": "The paper provides an interesting theoretical explanation on why gated RNN architectures such as LSTM and GRU work well in practice.
