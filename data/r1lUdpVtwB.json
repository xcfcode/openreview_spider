The context awareness of phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) approaches is also questionable. This research develops a system that translates English text to Amharic text using a combination of context based machine translation (CBMT) and a recurrent neural network machine translation (RNNMT). We built a bilingual dictionary for the CBMT system to use along with a large target corpus. The RNNMT model has then been provided with the output of the CBMT and a parallel corpus for training. Our combinational approach on English-Amharic language pair yields a performance improvement over the simple neural machine translation (NMT).", "keywords": ["Context based machine translation", "machine translation", "Neural network machine translation", "English to Amharic machine translation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The authors propose a model which combines a neural machine translation system and a context-based machine translation model, which combines some aspects of rule and example based MT.

In addition, the original paper on CBMT is the one claiming its better performance over other PBMT such as the SMT and the RBMT (Miller et al. Context-based machine Translation). These, however, are good points we should clarify in the paper.\n\nRe: using sub-word units may help alleviate the issue. \n\nThe paper mentioned (Sennrich et al. Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units) does have its own merit. However, the three focus areas (names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations)) do not cover most translation problems in Amharic. For example: there is such a thing in Amharic called \u1320\u1265\u1246-\u120b\u120d\u1276 \u201ctebko-lalito\u201d; in which the same word has two different meanings based on the pronunciation of a syllable in the word. Example: \u201c\u12eb\u1290\u1263\u1209\u201d \u201cyanebalu\u201d refers to reading when read stressing the \u2018ba\u2019 (\u1320\u1265\u1246-tebko) on the other hand when it is read without stressing on the \u2018ba\u2019 (\u120b\u120d\u1276-lalito) it means to cry. Such unique treats of Amharic can be addressed by seeing the context than any other methods proposed by the paper. Besides Tebko-lalto, Amharic has different meanings for the same word based on the context of the text. Our paper gives an example for this; the word \u2018acknowledge\u2019 could mean \u2018to know\u2019, \u2018to think\u2019, \u2018to accept\u2019 or \u2018to testify\u2019 based on the context of the sentence.\n\nRe:  The paper fails to cite related work, in particular on low-resource NMT (e.g. Gu et al. Universal Neural Machine Translation for Extremely Low Resource Languages) and unsupervised translation (e.g. Artetxe et al. Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation) \n\nThese surely are important papers to have cited. Thank you for bringing them to our attention, we will include them in the literature/related works section. The first paper by the Google researchers is universal and could be used for Amharic. However, it relies on having highly resourced semantically related language to help the low resourced languages. Amharic being a Semitic language, the closest highly resourced language to it would be Hebrew. However, Amharic has been highly influenced grammatically and semantically by Cushitic languages such as Agew and as a southern Semitic language, it is quite different from the northern Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic.\nThe unsupervised translation paper on the other hand uses a monolingual corpus which makes it ideal. The result shows the unsupervised is not as effective as semi-supervised and supervised. Although small, we do have a parallel corpus for the English-Amharic pair; hence the unsupervised does not seem to be ideal for the pair.\n\nRe: \u201cThe CBMT system is built on top of the Google Translate English-Amharic system. However, that model may have seen the test data during training.\u201d \n\nWe fear there might be a misunderstanding; the reviewer seems to may have believed that the CBMT is a model to train and using Google translate makes the system biased. However, Google translate is used in our work as a dictionary and nothing else.\n\nRe:\u201dBy combining CBMT with NMT, the authors obtain better results than NMT alone, but worse than with CBMT only. As such, the usefulness of the approach in a very low-resource scenario is unclear.\u201d\n\n We have made that claim on the bases of having a well-built bilingual dictionary producing a close to ideal CBMT output and combined with the NMT with increased size of corpus. This claim comes from the results for the book of Marks; the combinational system with the ideal setup (less errors introduced by the CBMT) performed better than all other systems (0.03 BLEU score over CBMT). It is known for neural network, size matters as stated by the paper (D. Ellis and N. Morgan.

The authors say that it outperforms other MT approaches, but a more recent reference would be needed. While neural machine translation may sometimes struggle with rare words, using sub-word units may help alleviate the issue (Sennrich et al. Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units). The claim that RNNs learn from their previous mistakes is also unclear.

Overall the quality of the writing is probably a bit below what's acceptable for publication at ICLR, but nothing that could not be fixed on subsequent revisions.\n\nNovelty: The method proposed appears to be a fairly straightforward variant of one proposed in a previous paper, where an NMT system was combined with a phrase-based MT system (Zoph & Knight, 2016). There seems to be no novel machine learning contribution (nor is it claimed). This paper seems more appropriate for a venue more focused on machine translation rather than a machine learning venue such as ICLR.\n\nEmpirical evidence in support of the claims: The authors set out to demonstrate that by combining a CBMT output into an NMT approach, one can get the best of both approaches. Their results do not strongly support this claim. The results suggest that in the context of the small-scale experiments considered, the baseline CBMT model is actually overall the best performing model.
