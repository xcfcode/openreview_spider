", "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) explores a large space of architectural motifs --  \na compute-intensive process that often involves ground-truth evaluation of each motif by instantiating it within a large network, and training and evaluating the network with thousands or more data samples. Inspired by how biological motifs such as cells are sometimes extracted from their natural environment and studied in an artificial Petri dish setting, this paper proposes the Synthetic Petri Dish model for evaluating architectural motifs. In the Synthetic Petri Dish, architectural motifs are instantiated in very small networks and evaluated using very few learned synthetic data samples (to effectively approximate performance in the full problem). The relative performance of motifs in the Synthetic Petri Dish can substitute for their ground-truth performance, thus accelerating the most expensive step of NAS. Unlike other neural network-based prediction models that parse the structure of the motif to estimate its performance, the Synthetic Petri Dish predicts motif performance by training the actual motif in an artificial setting, thus deriving predictions from its true intrinsic properties. Experiments in this paper demonstrate that the Synthetic Petri Dish can therefore predict the performance of new motifs with significantly higher accuracy, especially when insufficient ground truth data is available.\nOur hope is that this work can inspire a new research direction in studying the performance of extracted components of models in a synthetic diagnostic setting optimized to provide informative evaluations.", "keywords": ["Neural Architecture Search", "AutoML", "Meta-learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The reviewers overall appreciated the efforts of the authors in making NAS more computationally efficient.

Although this is a nice start, clearly this will not work if the architecture parameter being optimized over using NAS is 'width' itself. Have the authors considered such a scenario? \n\nThis is a very good point. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for searching activation functions and connectivity of cell microarchitectures. Modifying the Petri Dish to search over the width of the network is an interesting future-work direction. We have some initial ideas in this direction -- for example, architectures with variable layer-widths could be reduced in size by a fixed factor to create their corresponding motif-networks with variable widths. \n", "title": "Part 2 of Response to AnonReviewer2"}, "nzL156adSwV": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "PmghpBeirh", "comment": "$\\Vert$  the design section is written almost completely in prose without a well delineated algorithm. \n\nWe did summarize our method in Algorithm 1, but had to move it to the Appendix due to space constraints. This algorithm captures various aspects of Synthetic Petri Dish including initialization, training, inference and hybridization with other NAS methods. \n\n$\\Vert$   At first glance I believed that once the 'petri-dish' was initialized then ground truth evaluations would not be carried out again as it seems that is what the introduction is implying. However the authors combine the petri-dish with ground truth evaluations (Sec. 3.3). \n\nOnce the Petri Dish is warm-started with few ground-truth evaluations, it need not be re-trained with fresh ground-truth evaluations. For example, in Experiment 1 (search for the optimal slope of sigmoid), we train the Petri Dish only once and then utilize it to predict the performance of test points. \n\nIn Experiment 2, we combine Synthetic Petri Dish with popular NAS methods such as NAO (Luo et al., 2018) and Random Search. These NAS methods conduct their search in an iterative manner where each iteration involves ground-truth evaluation of the newly generated architectures. Since training the Petri Dish is cheap (requires just 2 hours on a CPU), we utilize the fresh ground-truth data from each NAS iteration to re-train the Petri Dish as well. This combined procedure of NAS with Petri Dish is explained in Figure 2 (b) and also in Algorithm 1. \n\n$\\Vert$  is it true that 'inference' carried out using this petri dish involves training a petri-dish network to convergence then evaluating its accuracy on the synthetic validation data? \n\nYes, that is correct. We also mention this detail in the paper. For example, section 3.1 states that -- \"Inner-loop training proceeds until individual BCE losses converge. Once trained, each motif-network is independently evaluated using the synthetic validation data to obtain individual validation loss values\". Subsequently, Section 3.2 states that during Petri Dish inference procedure, \"motif-networks are trained and evaluated using the optimized synthetic data with the same hyper-parameter settings as in the inner-loop training and evaluation.\" \n\n$\\Vert$  Although 'petri-dish inference' is defined in Sec 3.2, I see no usage of this exact verb in Sec 4.1\n\nSection 4.2 refers to Algorithm 1 and Figure 2 (b), both of which highlight the 'Petri Dish Inference' procedure. \n\n$\\Vert$  One concern I have is that the robustness of petri dish idea at mimicking the original network is not well established outside of a rather simple experiment in Fig. 1. \n\nBased on your feedback, we are currently working to add results from running Petri Dish for NASBench  in our paper. This will be included in our next revision very soon.\n\n$\\Vert$  Another concern with Fig. 1 is that the 'ground-truth' evaluations used to seed the two models appear to be artificially restricted to the shaded box. The training and test dataset on this experiment should be sampled i.i.d. unless the authors can provide a compelling reason why.\n\nWe restricted the training points for the performance prediction models to the blue-shaded region so that we can effectively test their generalization capability for unseen points. While training the NN model, we randomly sample batches of ground-truth points from the blue-shaded region. The experimental details are further described in Appendix A.3. \n\n$\\Vert$  With regards to Fig. 3, from what I can understand the authors considered usage of NAO over 3 iterations of 33 motifs each to yield 100 ground truth evaluation. Did the authors consider 5 iterations of NAO with 20 motifs each as in the petri-dish approach. What do the authors mean exactly with, \"For a fair comparison, original NAO is re-run in this limited ground-truth setting and the resulting performance is depicted by the red-curve in Figure 3\"? Can the authors exactly delineate their experimental settings in the appendix or in the main text.\n\nWe believe the reviewer has misunderstood our experimental setup for Experiment 2. All NAS variants in Experiment 2 (including NAO with Reduced Data) are run for the same number of iterations. Section 4.2 of the paper describes this in detail. For example, it states that -- \"In each NAS iteration, 100 newly generated motifs (variable M in algorithm 1) are evaluated using the Petri dish inference procedure and only the top 20 predicted motifs (variable K in algorithm 1) are evaluated for their ground-truth performance. The test perplexity of the best found motif at the end of each NAS iteration is plotted in Figure 3\". \n\nWe will try to further clarify this point in our revision. \n\n", "title": "Part 1 of Response to AnonReviewer2"}, "tumAR6O112E": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "oP_Pb8Pcp1r", "comment": "Thank you for recognizing the novelty of the method and the clarity of our paper.\n\n$\\Vert$  Is there a way to standardize the motif generation procedure for different architectures?\n\nEach motif variant is extracted from the ground-truth network and instantiated in the corresponding motif-network by reducing the width of the motif, while ensuring that the depth and the internal connectivity of the motif remains unchanged. For example, in the RNN cell search experiment, the ground-truth network has a cell that is composed of 12 layers (layer width of 850) and has millions of parameters. Each cell is extracted from its ground-truth setting and is instantiated in the motif-network with just three neurons per layer.

Instead, the synthetic data is randomly initialized at the start of the experiment and subsequently optimized during each outer-loop iteration (as detailed in Equations (2) and (3)). It is also possible to train a generator for the synthetic data and that could be an interesting direction for future-work. \n\nEach motif variant is extracted from the ground-truth network and instantiated in the corresponding motif-network by reducing the width of the motif, while ensuring that the depth and the internal connectivity of the motif remains unchanged.

Since the goal of Synthetic Petri Dish is to predict the performance ordering of motifs, we normalize the motif-performance values before plotting them. \n\n$\\Vert$  I do not understand why one has to define ground-truth loss and motif network loss.\n\nWe would like to clarify that we do not subtract the raw ground-truth loss and the raw motif-network loss. Instead, as explained in Section 3.1 and Equation (2), we construct the outer-loop loss by taking the difference between the normalized ground-truth loss and the normalized motif-network loss. The outer-loop loss tries to minimize the difference in the performance ordering of the motif networks and the ground-truth networks. To frame the outer-loop loss function, what is desired is for the validation loss of the motif-network to induce the same relative ordering as the validation loss of the ground-truth networks; such relative ordering is all that is needed to decide which new motif is likely to be best. One way to design such an outer-loop loss with this property is to penalize differences between normalized loss values in the Petri dish and ground-truth setting. To this end, the motif-network (inner-loop) loss values and their respective ground-truth loss values are first independently normalized to have zero-mean and unit-variance. Then, for each motif, a mean squared error (MSE) loss is computed between the normalized inner-loop validation loss and the normalized ground-truth validation loss. The MSE loss is averaged over all the motifs and used to compute a gradient step to improve the synthetic training and validation data. \n\n", "title": "Response to AnonReviewer3"}, "PmghpBeirh": {"type": "review", "replyto": "jk1094_ZiN", "review": "This paper presents an approach to accelerating NAS with 'petri-dish' networks, which hope to mimic the response of original networks at a fraction of training time cost. The key idea is to evaluate an architectural setting on a miniaturized network as opposed to the original network. With this approach computational effort is saved by eschewing expensive 'ground truth' original network evaluations.\n\nThe largest hinderance by far in the paper is the quality of the writing. Much of the paper is not well written, and difficult to understand. In particular, the design section is written almost completely in prose without a well delineated algorithm. The paper does not do a good job of guiding the reader through their proposed approach, thus much hunting and guessing is required to understand exactly what it is that the authors are proposing. E.g., at first glance I believed that once the 'petri-dish' was initialized then ground truth evaluations would not be carried out again as it seems that is what the introduction is implying. However the authors combine the petri-dish with ground truth evaluations (Sec. 3.3) but this is not clearly presented in the introduction. Another difficulty is it's unclear exactly the precise experimental settings used, making it impossible to be sure whether the experiments are 'fair' to competing approaches. E.g., to generate Fig. 1 a 'petri-dish' is initialized and trained, however is it true that 'inference' carried out using this petri dish involves training a petri-dish network to convergence then evaluating its accuracy on the synthetic validation data? Although 'petri-dish inference' is defined in Sec 3.2, I see no usage of this exact verb in Sec 4.1. It's difficult to connect these concepts as a reader without a well delineated algorithm which concretizes with precision what is being proposed.\n\nBesides these issues, the proposed idea is not fully well explored which also leads to doubt on the robustness of the approach. One concern I have is that the robustness of petri dish idea at mimicking the original network is not well established outside of a rather simple experiment in Fig. 1. As this is a key linchpin to the proposed approach, I strongly require an extensive experiment in a complex setting (with multiple properties of a network being searched over). Another concern with Fig. 1 is that the 'ground-truth' evaluations used to seed the two models appear to be artificially restricted to the shaded box. Neural networks operate under the i.i.d. setting thus making this approach biased against the NN Model approach. The training and test dataset on this experiments should be sampled i.i.d. unless the authors can provide a compelling reason why.\n\nWith regards to Fig. 3, from what I can understand the authors considered usage of NAO over 3 iterations of 33 motifs each to yield 100 ground truth evaluation.

Although this is a nice start, clearly this will not work if the architecture parameter being optimized over using NAS is 'width' itself. Have the authors considered such a scenario?

Numerical simulations are shown using two examples to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.\n\nPros:\n- The paper introduces a nice idea to speed up the problem of architecture/hyper-parameter search. The current search methods are often too prohibitive computationally, so this is a useful contribution.\n- The idea is well-motivated, and also quite general in terms of its applicability. As in, this method could be used to speed up a variety of architecture/hyper-parameter searches.\n\nCons:\n- The numerical evidence provided in the paper is quite minimal. It would be very interesting to see the performance of the method across different datasets as well as across different hyper-parameters. For instance, how does the method perform when it comes to choice of layers in a CNN (like different kinds of residual blocks) or transformers, learning rates, number of filters, etc. While the evidence provided in the paper is alright, there is lots of room to strengthen the paper.\n\nComments:\n- While I understand why Figure 1 is introduced very early in the paper, I feel it should be explained better. In particular, the use of normalised validation accuracy without defining it properly could lead to confusion. Is it possible to just use standard metrics like accuracy instead?\n- Equation (2): I do not understand why one has to define ground-truth loss and motif network loss. Because the two are subtracted, wouldn't the result be just the difference between the ground truth prediction and motif network prediction? In other words, (a-b)-(c-b) = (a-c). So essentially you are trying to minimise the difference between the predictions of the two models right?
