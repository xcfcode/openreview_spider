We present Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO), which takes the perspective that each optimization step should approximately minimize a proximal objective (similar to the ones used to motivate natural gradient and trust region policy optimization). Optimization hyperparameters are adapted to best minimize the proximal objective after one weight update. We show that an idealized version of APO (where an oracle minimizes the proximal objective exactly) achieves global convergence to stationary point and locally second-order convergence to global optimum for neural networks. APO incurs minimal computational overhead. We experiment with using APO to adapt a variety of optimization hyperparameters online during training, including (possibly layer-specific) learning rates, damping coefficients, and gradient variance exponents. For a variety of network architectures and optimization algorithms (including SGD, RMSprop, and K-FAC), we show that with minimal tuning, APO performs competitively with carefully tuned optimizers.", "keywords": ["hyperparameters", "optimization", "learning rate adaptation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper proposes an amortized proximal optimization method to adapt optimization hyperparameters.

We apologize that this was not clearly described in the paper, and we will add this information to the final version.\n\nUsing a larger weight decay of 5e-4 improves the baselines for SGD and SGDm to 94.32% and 94.82%, respectively, on CIFAR-10. Our current results for SGD-APO (93.82%) and SGDm-APO (94.59%) are still comparable to their respective baselines. We also verified that SGD-APO and SGDm-APO perform well with weight decay 5e-4, achieving test accuracies 94.22% and 94.62%, respectively.\n\nIn addition, we show in the WideResNet experiment below that APO performs well when using weight decay 5e-4.\n\n\nQ: Wide ResNets\n\nWe didn't use Wide ResNets due to computational limitations. Our aim was to show that APO is competitive with good fixed learning rates and with manual learning rate schedules for networks with reasonable performance.\n\nWe have obtained the following results with a 28-layer wide residual network with a widening factor of 10 (WideResNet-28-10). We followed the experimental setup from [1], training the model for 200 epochs with weight decay and the same learning rate schedule, that decays the learning rate by a factor of 5 three times during training. Our baseline result using SGD with momentum and a learning rate schedule achieves 96.01% test accuracy, and SGDm-APO achieves 95.48%. This shows that with this large network we achieve comparable results to a manual schedule.\n\nWe used the standard weight decay 5e-4 (as in [1]), and we show the results in the table below. We found that APO outperforms fixed learning rates and achieves a test accuracy comparable to the manual schedule.\n\nCIFAR-10               | WideResNet-28-10 |\n------------------------+---------------------------+\nSGD (fixed lr)                     89.42\nSGDm (fixed lr)                 92.60\nSGD (decayed lr)               94.73\nSGDm (decayed lr)           96.01\nSGD-APO                            94.84\nSGDm-APO                        95.48\n\nWe will include these results in the final version.\n\n\nQ: Computational overhead\n\nUsing the default meta-optimization scheme proposed in our paper, APO is ~1.3x as expensive as the baseline in practice. This cost could be reduced by performing less frequent meta-updates. In addition, our implementation is not optimized for performance, so this overhead could be reduced with careful engineering. In our current implementation, the overhead is somewhat affected by the size of the network and the speed of data loading (for the dissimilarity term).\n\n\nQ: Interpretation of lambda\n\nLambda trades off the progress made on the current minibatch with the average change in the predictions on independently-sampled minibatches. A large value of lambda will emphasize that an update to the model parameters should not cause a large change in the model\u2019s predictions on a separate minibatch, and thus will yield more conservative updates, while a small value of lambda would lead to more aggressive updates.\n\nWhen one uses APO to tune only the base learning rate, the hyperparameter lambda can be thought of as a parametrization of a learning rate schedule. Given a fixed base optimizer, a larger lambda corresponds to smaller learning rates in the schedule and vice versa. However, the exact mapping from lambda to a learning rate schedule differs for different base optimizers and network architectures. We found that this mapping is strongly related to the type of base optimizers: for SGD, SGDm, and RMSprop, the same lambda will lead to different learning rate schedules. We recommend using a grid search over lambda to find a schedule that performs well.\n\n\nQ: It would be nice to have an experiment similar to the one given in \"No More Pesky Learning Rates\" by Tom Schaul, Figure 2.\n\nWe have performed this experiment, and will add the plot to the final version. We followed the experimental setup from [2], which analyzed a quadratic cost function based on [3]. In the two-dimensional experiment of the noisy quadratic problem, we observed that SGD-APO approaches the minimum in the low curvature direction faster than the myopic best learning rate, which suggests that APO does not suffer from short-horizon bias.\n\n\n[1] Sergey Zagoruyko and Nikos Komodakis.

We have incorporated your suggestions into the revised version of the paper.\n\nQ: Relationship to optimizers with adaptive learning rates, and comparison between Adam and Adam-APO.\n\nWhile Adam and Adagrad are often described as having \u201cadaptive learning rates,\u201d they still have a global learning rate that is just as critical to tune as for SGD. In our experiments, we consider tuning the learning rate for RMSprop, which also maintains adaptive learning rates for each parameter, and is closely related to Adam/Adagrad. Adam is essentially RMSprop with momentum; APO can be applied to Adam by applying momentum on top of the updates computed by APO.\n\nTo address your question about Adam, we added experiments for tuning the global learning rate of Adam with APO in appendix Section G, Figure 14, where Adam-APO achieves better performance than Adam with a fixed global learning rate, and achieves comparable performance as Adam with a manual schedule.\n\n\nQ: Comparison with population-based training (PBT)\n\nWe have added a comparison between APO and PBT in appendix Section H, Figure 15.\n\nFor population-based training, one must carefully select many hyperparameters, including the size of the population, the perturbation strategy (e.g., randomly perturb the learning rate by multiplying it by 1.2 or 0.8), the exploration interval (e.g., the number of training iterations to run before exploiting other members of the population). We used PBT and APO to tune the learning rate of RMSprop while training a ResNet34 model on CIFAR-10. For PBT, we used a population of size 4, and chose to exploit/explore after each epoch of training. We tried multiple exploration strategies, and found that it was critical to set the probability of resampling a learning rate from an underlying distribution to be 0; otherwise, the learning rates could jump from small to large values, and yield unstable training.\n\nIn contrast, APO only requires a simple grid search over lambda, and all other hyperparameters can be kept at their default settings. We found that  APO substantially outperformed PBT, achieving a lower final training loss and equal test accuracy in much less wall-clock time; this shows the advantage of gradient-based methods for tuning learning rates, such as APO, compared to evolutionary methods based on random perturbations such as PBT.\n\n\nQ: The convergence results appear to rely on strong convexity of the loss. How is this a reasonable assumption?\n\nNote that we assume strong convexity of the loss as a function of the output units, not as a function of the weights. Hence, our assumption is fairly realistic in the neural net setting. The loss function on top of the network output is usually defined as a simple convex function; for instance, in regression, a common choice of loss function is the quadratic loss (i.e, the squared distance between the network output and the true label), which is strongly convex. In fact, even without assuming that the loss function is strongly convex and that the output manifold is dense, we are still able to show a fast convergence rate. In the updated version of the paper, we show that our algorithm with an oracle converges to stationary point globally with a fast rate, which provides insight into why APO works well.\n\n\nQ: In your experiments, you set the learning rate to be really low. What happens if you set it to be arbitrarily high? Can you algorithm recover good learning rates?\n\nAPO is robust to the initial learning rate of the base optimizer, using the default meta learning rate suggested in our updated paper. We have added a section to the appendix in which we include RMSprop-APO experiments on Rosenbrock, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 to show that the training loss, test accuracy, and learning rate trajectories are nearly identical when starting with initial learning rates {1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7}, spanning 5 orders of magnitude. Note that 1e-2 is quite a large initial learning rate for RMSprop.\n", "title": "Addressed Adam, PBT, and initial learning rates"}, "Bkld8r3FRQ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJl8R-eTnQ", "comment": "Thank you for your helpful comments. We have addressed your concern about the baseline models and learning rate schedules in our updated paper.\n\nQ: It is hard to say whether the results are applicable in practice; need updates to baselines and comparison with learning rate schedules.\n\nWe have updated the baselines in our paper for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, using a larger, modern network, ResNet34, in place of the VGG11 model used previously. We also compared APO to manual learning rate decay schedules. For CIFAR-10/100, we trained for 200 epochs, decaying the learning rate by a factor of 5 three times during training. The ResNet34 with a custom learning rate decay schedule achieves 93-94% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ~74% test accuracy on CIFAR-100. We believe that this is a strong baseline, and shows the applicability of APO in practical settings.\n\nThe final test accuracies of the updated model using SGD/SGDm with and without APO are:\n\n                                  | CIFAR-10 | CIFAR-100 |\n--------------------------+--------------+---------------+\nSGD (fixed lr)                92.97            72.69\nSGDm (fixed lr)            92.77            72.53\nSGD (decayed lr)          93.29            73.45\nSGDm (decayed lr)      93.53            73.80\nSGD-APO                       93.82            74.65\nSGDm-APO                   94.59            73.89\n\nThe test accuracies using RMSprop and K-FAC with APO are shown in our response to all reviewers at the top.\nThe results in these tables show that APO is competitive with manual schedules in terms of test accuracy. The updated figures in our paper show that APO is competitive with manual schedules both in terms of test accuracy and training loss.\n\n\nQ: Does the hyperparameter lambda itself benefit from some scheduling?\n\nIn our updated paper we show that APO with a fixed lambda achieves comparable performance to manual learning rate decay schedules. While using a schedule for lambda can potentially further improve performance, a simple grid search over fixed lambda values already leads to strong performance, and has the advantage that it is easy to use in practice.\n\n\nQ: You mention that \"APO converges quickly from different starting points on the Rosenbrock surface\" but 10000 iterations is not quick at all for the 2-dimensional Rosenbrock, it is extremely slow compared to 100-200 function evaluations needed for Nelder-Mead to solve it.

The meta learning rate and meta update interval can be kept at our default values, which work well across many settings. Since each setting of lambda determines a learning rate schedule, tuning lambda is more valuable than tuning a fixed learning rate; it is equivalent to tuning a full learning rate schedule, for which the search space is much larger (i.e., to find a schedule manually, one must decide how often to decay the learning rate, and by what factor to decay each time).\n", "title": "Updated paper with additional experiments and improved writing"}, "Bkg51P6KCX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SklCKPP1h7", "comment": "Thank you for your helpful comments.

The convergence analysis is on Z, not on parameters x and hyper-parameters theta. So, bounds here cannot be used to explain empirical observations in Section 5. \n\nThe convergence of the network output Z directly indicates the rate of decrease of the loss function, which is exactly what we observe in practice. Although the assumption of a global optimization oracle is not realistic, we believe our theoretical justification provides insight into why the method works. One important takeaway from the theoretical analysis is that running gradient descent on output space can potentially accelerate the optimization (since the convergence bounds have better constants). This directly motivates the regularization term in our meta objective to be defined as the discrepancy of network outputs instead of the network parameters, which is essential to our technique.\n\n\nQ: Could the authors compare with changing step-size?\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have added comparisons with custom learning rate schedules for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\nWe updated our results for CIFAR-10/100 using a larger network, ResNet34, instead of the VGG11 model used in the previous version, and we used a manual learning rate decay schedule where we trained for 200 epochs, decaying the learning rate by a factor of 5 three times during training.\n\nWe found that APO is competitive with the custom schedule, achieving similar training loss and test accuracy.

Because each lambda value gives rise to a learning rate schedule, tuning lambda yields significantly more value than tuning a fixed learning rate. Instead of trying to come up with a custom learning rate schedule, which would require deciding how frequently to decay the learning rate, and by what factor it should be decayed, all one needs to do is perform a grid search over a fixed set of lambdas to find an automated schedule that is competitive with hand-designed schedules (which are the result of years of accumulated experience in the field).\n", "title": "Clarified writing and additional experiments"}, "r1labrqphm": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rJl6M2C5Y7", "review": "Summary:\nThis paper introduces Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO) that optimizes a proximal objective at each optimization step.

Can you algorithm recover good learning rates?\n", "title": "Interesting and Novel contribution - Some concerns that need to be answered regarding experiments and theory", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "SJl8R-eTnQ": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rJl6M2C5Y7", "review": "The paper proposes an approach to adapt hyperparameters online. \nWhen learning rates are in focus, a convincing message would be to show that adaptation of learning rates is more efficient and simpler than their scheduling when tested on state-of-the-art architectures. \nA. You demonstrate the results on CIFAR-10 for 10% error rates which corresponds to networks which are far from what is currently used in deep learning. Thus, it is hard to say whether the results are applicable in practice. \nB. You don't schedule learning rates for your baseline methods except for a single experiment for some initial learning rate. \nC. Your method involves a hyperparameter to be tuned which affects the shape of the schedule. This hyperparameter itself benefits from (requires?) some scheduling. \n\nIt would be interesting to see if the proposed method is competitive for training contemporary networks and w.r.t. simple schedule schemes. Online tuning of  hyperparameters is an important functionality and I hope your paper will make it more straightforward to use it in practice. \n\n\n* Minor notes:\n\nYou mention that \"APO converges quickly from different starting points on the Rosenbrock surface\" but 10000 iterations is not quick at all for the 2-dimensional Rosenbrock, it is extremely slow compared to 100-200 function evaluations needed for Nelder-Mead to solve it. I guess you mean w.r.t. the original RMSprop.
