In this work, we address the problem of Low-shot network-expansion\nlearning. We introduce a learning framework which enables expanding a pre-trained\n(base) deep network to classify novel classes when the number of examples for the\nnovel classes is particularly small. We present a simple yet powerful distillation\nmethod where the base network is augmented with additional weights to classify\nthe novel classes, while keeping the weights of the base network unchanged. We\nterm this learning hard distillation, since we preserve the response of the network\non the old classes to be equal in both the base and the expanded network. We\nshow that since only a small number of weights needs to be trained, the hard\ndistillation excels for low-shot training scenarios. Furthermore, hard distillation\navoids detriment to classification performance on the base classes. Finally, we\nshow that low-shot network expansion can be done with a very small memory\nfootprint by using a compact generative model of the base classes training data\nwith only a negligible degradation relative to learning with the full training set.", "keywords": ["Low-Shot Learning", "class incremental learning", "Network expansion", "Generative model", "Distillation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "Two reviewers recommended rejection, and one is slightly more positive.

Thus the so-called hard distillation is proposed. This paper is well-written and well organized. The good points are as follows,\n\n1. The paper proposes a well-performance method for the important low-shot learning problem based on the transform learning.\n2. The Gen-LSNE maintains a small memory footprint using a generative model for base examples and requires a few more parameters to avoid overfitting and take less time to train.\n3. This paper builds up a benchmark for low-shot network expansion.\n\nThere are some problems,\n1. There still is drop in accuracy on the base classes after adding new classes, and the accuracy may still drop as adding more classes due to the fixed parameters corresponding to the base classes. This is slightly undesired.\n2.

This paper stipulates some interesting ideas, using an idea of expansion layers (using a form of hard distillation, where the weights of known classes are fixed), a GMM to model the already learned classes (to reduce storage), and a form of gradient dropout (updating just a subset of the weights using a dropout mask). All of these assume a fixed representation, trained on the base classifier, then only the final classification layer is adjusted for the novel examples. \n\nThe major drawback is that none of these ideas are fully explored. Given fixed representation, for example the influence of forgetting on base classes, the number of components used in the GMM, the influence of the low-shot, the dropout rate, etc etc.  The second major drawback is that the experimental setting seems very unrealistic: 5 base classes and 2 novel classes. \n\nTo conclude: the ideas in this paper are very interesting, but difficult to gather insights given the focus of the experiments.\n\nMinor remarks\n- Sect 4.1 \"The randomly ... 5 novel classes\" is not a correct sentence.\n- The extended version of NCM (4.2.1), here uses as prototype-kNN (Hastie 2001) has also been explored in the paper of NCM, using k-means per class to extract prototypes.\n- Given fixed representations, plenty of work has focused on few-shot (linear) learning, this work should be compared to these.

They propose to do a `hard' distillation, i.e. they\nintroduce new nodes and parameters to the network to add the new classes, but only fine-tune the new\nnetworks without modifying the original parameters. This ensures that, in the new expanded and\nfine-tuned network, the class confusions will only be between the old and new classes and not\nbetween the old classes, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. In addition they use GMMs trained on\nthe old classes during the fine-tuning process, thus avoiding saving all the original training data.\nThey show experiments on public benchmarks with three different scenarios, i.e.  base and novel\nclasses from different domains, base and novel classes from the same domain and novel classes have\nsimilarities among themselves, and base and novel classes from the same domain and each novel class\nhas similarities with at least one of the base class.                        \n                                                                             \n- The paper is generally well written and it is clear what is being done     \n- The idea is simple and novel; to the best of my knowledge it has not been tested before\n- The method is compared with Nearest Class Means (NCM) and Prototype-kNN with soft distillation\n  (iCARL; where all weights are fine-tuned).

We ask to draw the reviewer's attention to the following:\n\nIn this work, we focus on a robotic unit in real-life scenarios. It is often desired to be able to adapt to a single or two new classes available with only very few samples. We choose to establish the proposed benchmark for the task of Low-Shot Network expansion in a manner that will reflect this task. That is, we wanted the number of novel classes to be relatively small so the effect of Network adaptation to small quantities of new data can be studied. \n\nWe defined the class (base + novel) average accuracy to be our performance metric.  \nWe did not want the base classes accuracy to have overwhelmly more weight than the novel classes in the average accuracy metric, hence we defined the number of base classes to be in a range similar to the number of novel classes. We\u2019ve composed a dataset with a common cardinality (similar to CIFAR10 is O(10), MNIST is O(10) and SVHN is O(10)). While O(10) is considerably smaller than imagenet 1000 classes classification task. It is still a common classification task, which is also common in robotic unit applications. \n\nIn order to avoid bias in the constructed dataset, we\u2019ve performed numerous random experiment, and reported their average result: \n \nThe test on imagenet partitions was done by randomly selecting 50 classes, and then randomly partitioning to 5 groups of 10 , which are then further randomly partitioned to 5 base and 5 novel classes. The result of every experiment done with a given number of novel samples is averaged on 25 = 5X5 trails. That is Figure 2 is the result of 125 tests = 25 averaging X 5 #novel samples.\n\nFigure 5a Is the result of 25 (base,novel group avg) X 8 #novel samples = 200 trails.\n\nIn this unbiased test case, we addressed 3 typical scenarios: generic classes from imagenet, Domain specific with similar novel classes,  Domain specific with similar class in base. We\u2019ve further explored the effect and gain of Gen-LSNE compared to other methods in each of these scenarios. We concentrated our effort to analyze and explore the qualities of the proposed method in scenarios that are common in robotic unit real-life scenarios, and to the best of our knowledge the designed benchmark realistically reflect those.\n", "title": "Design considerations of the proposed benchmark"}}}
