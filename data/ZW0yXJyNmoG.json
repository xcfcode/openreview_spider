", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks are notoriously challenging to train. The underlying minmax optimization is highly susceptible to the variance of the stochastic gradient and the rotational component of the associated game vector field. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Lookahead algorithm for minmax optimization, originally developed for single objective minimization only. The backtracking step of our Lookahead\u2013minmax naturally handles the rotational game dynamics, a property which was identified to be key for enabling gradient ascent descent methods to converge on challenging examples often analyzed in the literature. Moreover, it implicitly handles high variance without using large mini-batches, known to be essential for reaching state of the art performance. Experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate a clear advantage of combining Lookahead\u2013minmax with Adam or extragradient, in terms of performance and improved stability, for negligible memory and computational cost. Using 30-fold fewer parameters and 16-fold smaller minibatches we outperform the reported performance of the class-dependent BigGAN on CIFAR-10 by obtaining FID of 12.19 without using the class labels, bringing state-of-the-art GAN training within reach of common computational resources.", "keywords": ["Minmax", "Generative Adversarial Networks"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The reviews were a bit mixed, with a general consensus towards acceptance.

Theorem 2, in its current form, is quite weak in two aspects: (a) without checking its proof one can already see how to derive it in 1 line or 2. (b) if the base optimizer already converges, what is the point of having lookahead to converge as well? The potentially different convergence rate should be one's target here. It is certainly fine for the authors to not fully justify their proposed algorithm, as long as the authors (hopefully) are at least aware of the issues.\n\n(d) Section 4 is a bit disappointing as one would have expected the authors to derive some qualitative results here (also raised by some reviewers)."}, "review": {"TjBFmBLybZ_": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ZW0yXJyNmoG", "review": "Summary: This work extends the recently proposed lookahead optimizer (which was designed for single-objective optimization) to minimax optimization, particularly GAN training. The authors claim that the backtracking step in lookahead optimizer alleviates the notorious rotational behavior in GAN dynamics. Moreover, the authors argue that the lookahead optimizer implicitly handles the high variance in the small-batch setting. Both arguments are backed up by toy experiments on stochastic bilinear games.  Finally, on standard image datasets, the lookahead minimax algorithm outperforms some popular algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10.\n\nReview: This paper is well-written and explains the main idea in a clear and effective manner. The empirical results of the introduced lookahead minimax algorithm are quite impressive given its simplicity. However, the lookahead minimax dynamics is not well-understood and no theoretical justification is provided in the paper. The bilinear game might not reflect the real GAN training as standard GDA never diverges in real GAN training. I tend to give a score of 7 or even higher, but I'm not satisfied with the current explanation of the performance gain. I think a better understanding of the dynamics is needed and I will increase my rating if the authors could improve the paper accordingly.\n\nHere are detailed comments:\n\n1. In the third paragraph of the introduction, the authors mentioned that empirically GANs often converge to a locally stable stationary point that is not a differential Nash equilibrium. Actually, this phenomenon occurs even for the simplest quadratic minimax games, see for example [1, 2, 3]. Moreover, Nash equilibrium might not even exist in general, Stackelberg equilibrium [2, 4] is probably a better solution notion.\n\n2. The authors provide some theoretical results of the lookahead optimizer, but for single-objective optimization. I suggest the authors moving this section to the Appendix (as this section seems irrelevant) and replace it with the analysis of lookahead for minimax games. In particular, the authors argue many times in the paper that the lookahead algorithm is able to handle the rotational dynamics well, I think the authors should be able to verify that theoretically on quadratic minimax games if the argument is right.\n\n3. The bilinear game might not reflect the real training dynamics of GANs. In bilinear games, simultaneous GDA with finite step sizes simply diverges, but it is not the case in practice for GAN training. To this end, strongly-convex strongly-concave minimax games might be better to model the underlying GAN dynamics. Strongly-convex strongly-concave quadratic minimax games shall be as simple as the bilinear cases and some theoretical analyses and simulation should be easy to do. \n\n4. In the paper, the authors chose Extragradient as one of their baselines. However, after inspecting the code, I find much fewer iterations are used for Extragradient. I understand the authors would like to keep the total gradient queries the same over different algorithms, but there is a similar algorithm (Optimistic gradient descent ascent [5, 6]) with only one gradient query per step and perform similarly with Extragradient. In this sense, I think it is fair to only use fewer iterations for Extragradient. \n\n5. For stochastic games (especially for SB-G), there is a better version of Extragradient which handles the variance well, see [7] for details.\n\n6. In the original lookahead paper, it was mentioned that the slow weights can be understood as the exponential moving average (EMA) of the fast weights. In particular, the authors of the original lookahead paper did some analysis on a noisy quadratic model and showed lookahead reduces variance. In that simple noisy quadratic model, exponential moving average can effectively reduce variance, see section 3.4 of [8] for details. I think it is probably worth testing EMA on the toy experiments and mentioning it in the paper. I notice that the authors have already included EMA in section 5 and EMA improves the performance a lot. To this end, I think the advantages of lookahead can be potentially decomposed into two parts (though more works need to be done): (1) it suppresses the rotational part in game dynamics (I encourage the authors to analyze the spectrum of the dynamics); (2) it implicitly does exponential moving average and hence reduces the variance.\n\nOverall, I think this paper is very strong on the empirical results. However, analysis on the dynamics of the lookahead algorithm is lacking. I will be happy to increase my rating if the authors could resolve some of my comments.\n\n--------------------\n**In the rebuttal, the authors resolved most of my concerns, therefore I increased my score to 7 as promised.**\n\n\nReference:\n[1] On Finding Local Nash Equilibria (and Only Local Nash Equilibria) in Zero-Sum Games, 2019.\n\n[2] On Solving Minimax Optimization Locally: A Follow-the-Ridge Approach, 2020.\n\n[3] GANs May Have No Nash Equilibria, 2020.\n\n[4] Convergence of learning dynamics in Stackelberg games, 2019.\n\n[5] Training GANs with Optimism, 2018.\n\n[6] A Unified Analysis of Extra-gradient and Optimistic Gradient Methods for Saddle Point Problems: Proximal Point Approach, 2019.\n\n[7] Revisiting Stochastic Extragradient, 2019.\n\n[8] Which Algorithmic Choices Matter at Which Batch Sizes?

Below we answer separately to your detailed comments.\n\n1. In our understanding, recent works give a game-theoretic interpretation of these points (as diff. Stackelberg Equilibria - DSE), however, as these are a superset of DNEs it remains unclear if the performance of the leader at DSE (on average) is as good as at DNEs (and approximate DNEs are guaranteed to exist [Daskalakis, Skoulakis, Zampetakis, Sep.2020]). We remain brief in this section by only mentioning the needed info (which we consider valid) to present our empirical result that LA converges to a point which has no rotation-Fig. 5 (relevant to show, as to our knowledge, such a case hasn\u2019t been observed so far in GAN training). We added a new section in the supplementary (App. C, referenced from the 3rd paragraph of Sec. 2), where we also discuss the references you listed.\n\n2. We aim to keep this paper mainly empirical for clarity, while still clarifying that besides that Lookahead-Minmax has been shown to work well in practice there is no result (to our knowledge) on improved upper bound on its convergence rate (which we consider important to clarify). Given the extra page allowed (relative to the initial submission), we\u2019d like to keep this result in the main paper. \nTo address your main concern--verifying theoretically our argument on \u2018handles well rotations\u2019, please see our revised section 4 and App. B. (also related to your last question 6), thanks! \n\n3. Thanks for the suggestion, we considered a quadratic function from the FtR-Approach in reference [2], and we did a spectral analysis comparing Extragradient (EG), GDA, and their Lookahead-Minmax counterparts LA-EG, and LA-GDA. We computed the spectral radius of those operators for a wide range of pairs of learning rates for each player and saved the parameters giving us the best contraction. In figure 10, we plot the distance to the optimum as a function of the number of passes, for the best contraction. Our results are in line with our bilinear experiments, as (i) Lookahead-Minmax methods have the best contraction when compared to GDA and EG, and (ii) Lookahead-Minmax improves the contraction of the base optimizer. \nWe think the bilinear game (BG) is relevant as it has high rotation--which standard minimization algorithms don\u2019t handle well (and SB-G has both high rotation and noise), is widely studied,  and finally, we find it empirically relevant as: (i) although alt-GDA does not diverge at the beginning of the training (as on BG), it diverges notably earlier than EG)  (ii) we see empirical relevance as pointed out in Fig. 2. \n\n4. As both EG and Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) can be seen as approximating Proximal Point Method [Mokhtari et al. 2019] we selected one of these. We added OGDA in Fig. 3, where OGDA exploits well the fact that the gradient is smooth for the bilinear game (to approximate EG with past gradient), and outperforms EG when the x-axis is the gradient queries. For the larger-scale experiments, we selected EG and trained all methods for a fixed number of parameter updates (not gradient queries, so we think OGDA can perform as good or worse as the reported results for EG).\n\n[Mokhtari et al.] A Unified Analysis of Extra-gradient and Optimistic Gradient Methods for Saddle Point Problems: Proximal Point Approach, 2019\n\n5. Thanks a lot for the reference, we\u2019ll try to add it in our next revision.   \n\n6. We added the result of EMA on SB-G in the App. D.3. We do not show EMA for toy-experiments in the main paper, as for convex-concave objective EMA is less interesting than the uniform average (UA) (one can show that UA of GDA on a bounded domain converges due to convexity, which to our knowledge cannot be shown for EMA). On the other hand, UA is not interesting for DNNs, as in a highly non-convex non-concave DNN setting we can no longer rely on convexity for UA to converge, and EMA is shown to perform notably better than UA in practice (consistent with our UA results in App.), see discussions on \u2018last iterate convergence\u2019 in [1,2]. \nThanks a lot for your recommendation to analyze the spectrum of the dynamics!

This is hard for me to interpret as the total number of iterations are the same, which is 500k.\n\nThanks for the question. Table 1 reports the *best* scores ever obtained per method while computing the computationally-expensive IS and FID scores once every few thousands of parameter updates (and then averaging these over 5 seeds)--as reported in all related works that we are aware of [all refs in Table 2]. Note that contrary to classification, GAN training often diverges on real-world applications (also with 5:1 update ratio of D:G, see our paragraph on stability), and GAN methods in practice store a copy of the best performing model obtained during the training and return this model. We updated the caption to make this clearer. Thus, the result of 14.37 is the mean of the best FIDs of the LA-AltGAN methods obtained over 500k iterations (not at the 500K iter).\n\n> In terms of writing, I would recommend to focus on the minmax problem.

How Adam is applied in these algorithms? These proposed variants are not very clear to the reader. Also is the number of passes the same as the number of iterations?\n\nWe added explicit descriptions of both LA-EG and LA-GAN-Adam in the appendix (Alg. 4 & 5), and we re-wrote Alg.1 more generally. By using a \u201clooser\u201d pseudo-code of Alg.1 in the paper, we aim to point out the general \u201cmeta/wrapper\u201d nature of LA--Minmax: the fact that it can be combined with any \"base\u201d-optimizer. Please see our revised beginning of Section 4 and Alg.1. We are considering your recommendation regarding Section 3 and hope to address it in our next revision (before the author response deadline). \nThe number of passes is different from the number of iterations, where the former is normalized by the computation and denotes one cycle of forward+backward pass, or alternatively can be expressed as the number of \u201cgradient queries\u201d (this term is taken from the optimization literature, and the SVRE reference). In other words, using parameter updates as the x-axis could be misleading as for example, extragradient uses extra passes (gradient queries) per parameter update. The number of passes is thus a fair indicator of the computational complexity (as wall-clock time measurements can be relatively noisier).  Due to lack of space, we added this description on the \u201cnumber of passes\u201d in the Appendix (and we reference it from Section 4.1 in the main paper).\n\n> To make the results in Fig 5. more conclusive, I would recommend to zoom into the eigenvalues of LA-AltGAN, to see how small the imagery parts of the eigenvalues are.
