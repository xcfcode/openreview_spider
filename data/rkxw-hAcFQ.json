When modeling such settings, it is often beneficial to design hierarchical models that can capture long-term coordination using intermediate variables.  Furthermore, these intermediate variables should capture interesting high-level behavioral semantics in an interpretable and manipulable way. We present a hierarchical framework that can effectively learn such sequential generative models.  Our approach is inspired by recent work on leveraging programmatically produced weak labels, which we extend to the spatiotemporal regime. In addition to synthetic settings, we show how to instantiate our framework to effectively model complex interactions between basketball players and generate realistic multi-agent trajectories of basketball gameplay over long time periods. We validate our approach using both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study comparison conducted with professional sports analysts.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "generative models", "imitation learning", "hierarchical methods", "data programming", "weak supervision", "spatiotemporal"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper presents generative models to produce multi-agent trajectories.

We respond to your main points below.\n\n> \u201c... how would an intermediate baseline model where a set of parameters are shared and each agent also has an independent set of parameters perform?\u201d\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we trained such a model where the positions of all players are fed into a single GRU network, but independent networks are used to compute latent variables for each agent. This is a mix between VRNN-single and VRNN-indep, which we will call VRNN-mixed, and achieves an ELBO of 2331 and similar statistics as VRNN-indep (we will update Table 1 and Table 3). We\u2019ve also included some generated samples at (https://bit.ly/2S66iO9). However, we emphasize that this model remains fundamentally different from our solution, as our solution provides a degree of controllability and interpretability (through macro-intents) not offered by these baselines. \n\n> \u201cHow is the threshold for macro-intent generation selected.\u201d\n\nThe threshold is chosen such that it qualitatively matches realistic basketball behavior (i.e. when a basketball player is considered stationary). However, this is a very interesting question raised by the reviewer regarding the effect of labeling functions on the stability and robustness of the model. One can imagine other domains where labeling functions come from a variety of sources, some of which are noisy or redundant. Designing an algorithm that can process these labels and incorporate them into sample generation is a new line of research that we are very excited about.\n\n> \u201c... could using separate [macro-intent] vector for each agent \u2026 give the same result?\n\nIn the basketball setting, individual macro-intents are in fact sufficient for generating corresponding trajectories. However, this is mainly an architectural detail that is domain-dependent and not the most important part of our contributions. For example, one can also define macro-intents that cannot be factorized for each agent, such as friendly/unfriendly behavior in the Boids model included in our experiments.\n\n> Minor Comments\n\nThe results come from sampling from the posterior distribution. The average standard deviation of the learned posterior distribution is around 0.08 per latent dimension. The standard deviation of the learned likelihood of the data is very peaked (often less than 0.01). The macro-intent RNN model achieves a log-likelihood of 2180, which is an improvement over the RNN-gauss model but still worse than all VRNN models.

One can envision many settings in which users wish to have diverse and detailed control over what\u2019s being generated. We believe models with this degree of control can be learned by incorporating labeling functions defined by users according to their preferences.

We will update the paper to make this more clear.\n\n> \u201c... could not the other models have higher likelihoods?\u201d\n\nYes, a higher ELBO does not imply a higher true likelihood, as it depends on the tightness of the bound. Computing the exact likelihood is infeasible, but it can be approximated with importance sampling. However, we note that likelihoods do not necessary correspond to quality of generated samples, as evidenced by our experiments and by [1].

We briefly summarize our contributions below.\n\nWe work in a novel sequential modeling setting in which the target phenomenon (coordinated multi-agent behavior) is inherently non-deterministic and multimodal. Current approaches do not scale to the complexity of this problem because the space of all possible multi-agent trajectories is exponentially large w.r.t. the number of agents, and the agents are often highly coordinated. \n\nWe propose an efficient solution that uses a simple labeling function in sequential generative models to learn a macro-intent latent variable that encodes long-term intent and captures the coordination between agents. Our results demonstrate that our model generates trajectories of significantly higher quality than current baselines. Lastly, we highlight that our approach provides a degree of control and interpretability not offered by other baselines; the macro-intent variables are well understood (since they originate from a heuristic labeling function) and their effect on generated samples can be easily analyzed. \n\nWe believe that this work opens a new line of research into algorithms that can provide users with various degrees of control during sample generation. Current alternatives involve learning latent variables in a fully unsupervised fashion and inspecting them after training for interpretable features. Our work uses labeling functions to directly control sample generation in ways that can be specified by the user. For example, the labeling function we used for basketball allows users to control where they want players to go (see Figure 6a in our paper).

The model is trained to maximize the ELBO objective and log-likelihood over macro-intent labels. Experimental results are conducted over a basketball gameplay dataset (to model the trajectories of the offensive team members) and a synthetic dataset.

To understand the contribution of the shared macro-intent, how would an intermediate baseline model where a set of parameters are shared between agents and each agent also has an independent set of parameters perform?

How does this parameter affect the overall performance? Since the smoothness of the segments between two macro-intents depend on this parameter, I am wondering its effect on the learned posterior distribution.\n\n- Rather than using the prediction of the macro-intent RNN as a single global vector (\\hat{g}_t), could using separate vectors for each agent (corresponding blocks of \\hat{g}_t) as inputs to VRNN give the same results? Since the macro-intent RNN is already aware of all the macro-intents, it would be interesting to see if individual macro-intents are sufficient for VRNN to generate corresponding trajectories.\n\n\nMinor Comments\n\n- Do results in Table (1) come from sampling or using mode of the distributions?

The generative models are hierarchical, and these latent variables correspond to higher level goals in agent behavior. The paper focuses on basketball offenses as a motivating scenario in which multiple agents have coordinated high-level behavior. The generative models are RNNs where each output is fed into the decoder of a variational autoencoder to produce observed states. The authors add an intermediate layer to capture the latent variables, called macro-intents. The parameters are learned by maximizing an evidence lower bound.\n\nExperiments qualitatively and quantitatively show that the hierarchical model produces realistic multi-agent traces.\n\n# Comments\n\nThe paper presents a sensible solution for heuristically labeling latent variables. It is not particularly surprising that the model then learns useful behavior because it no longer has to maximize the marginal likelihood over all possible macro-intents. What is more interesting is that a heuristic labeling function is sufficient to label macro-intents that lead to learning realistic basketball offenses and swarm behavior.\n\nAre any of the baselines (VRNN-single, VRNN-indep, and VRNN-mi) equivalent to training the hierarchical model by maximizing an ELBO on the marginal likelihood? I do not think this comparison is done, which might be interesting to quantify how much of a difference heuristic labeling makes. Of course, the potentially poor fit of a variational distribution would confound the results.\n\n# Minor things\n\n1) In the caption of Table 1, it says \"Our hierarchical model achieves higher log-likelihoods than baselines for both datasets.\" Are not the reported scores evidence lower-bounds? So it achieves a higher evidence lower bound, but without actually computing the true likelihood, could not the other models have higher likelihoods?\n\n2) Under \"Human preference study\" it says \"All judges preferred our model over the baselines with 98% statistical significance.\" I am not familiar with this terminology.
