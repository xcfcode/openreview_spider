A major contributing factor to this success is that convolutional networks impose strong prior assumptions about natural images. A surprising experiment that highlights this architectural bias towards natural images is that one can remove noise and corruptions from a natural image without using any training data, by simply fitting (via gradient descent) a randomly initialized, over-parameterized convolutional generator to the corrupted image. While this over-parameterized network can fit the corrupted image perfectly, surprisingly after a few iterations of gradient descent it generates an almost uncorrupted image. This intriguing phenomenon enables state-of-the-art CNN-based denoising and regularization of other inverse problems. In this paper, we attribute this effect to a particular architectural choice of convolutional networks, namely convolutions with fixed interpolating filters. We then formally characterize the dynamics of fitting a two-layer convolutional generator to a noisy signal and prove that early-stopped gradient descent denoises/regularizes. Our proof relies on showing that convolutional generators fit the structured part of an image significantly faster than the corrupted portion.

Theorems on the convergence of this fitting are discussed and proven in the appendices. Intermediate results study the convergence of fitting a linear model to an image plus noise and fitting a single-layer CNN. Denoising is demonstrated on two images with additive white Gaussian noise and the approach under study is shown to provide a better signal-to-noise ratio than BM3D, another untrained denoising approach. The main result is that the use of upsampling via a fixed interpolation filter provides an inductive bias towards \"natural\" images.\n\nThe bibliography does a good job of positioning this paper within the recent set of articles exploring the curious behavior of fitting a CNN to a single image. The problem is interesting, timely, and surprising. The analysis does provide some insight into what is going on.\n\nBut, the paper would do well to embrace the Fourier domain and first discuss what is meant by \"natural images\" and \"noise\" in terms of their frequency content. In particular, something like Simoncelli and Olshausen (2001) could be used as a description of the spectra of natural images. Additive white Gaussian noise has a flat spectrum, which is never mentioned in the paper. Thus, the theoretical result mainly highlights the fact that natural images have a low-pass spectrum, while white noise has a flat spectrum, and CNNs using interpolation also have a low-pass spectrum in some sense. This makes sense from a frequency perspective, because interpolation increases the sampling rate of a signal without changing its frequency content, i.e., it adds high frequencies with no energy. \n\nThe \"trigonometric basis\" used in the paper, which consists of sines and cosines at each frequency, could be more cleanly described as a basis of complex exponentials, i.e., the Fourier basis, which doesn't require partitioning the basis into a cosine half and a sine half. The discussion of triangular and Gaussian smoothing functions has been very well explored in the signal processing literature discussing windowing functions and their Fourier transforms, e.g., Harris (1978). I don't think Figure 3 showing some sinusoids is necessary.\n\nThe main body of the paper goes into the 10th page, but the appendices make up another 18 pages.

With this response we are trying to address the last concern. \nOur theorems provide rigours statements from which a convergence rate as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio at any particular frequency $i$, can be obtained, as asked for in the comment above.\nSpecifically, a slight variation of Theorem 2 (obtained from equation (iv) in the paragraph in the proof entitled ``concluding the proof of Theorem 3'') yields that, under exactly the same conditions as Theorem 2, the estimate after $\\tau$ iterations of gradient descent, given by $G(\\mathbf C_\\tau)$, obeys\n$$\n\\left|\\langle G(\\mathbf C_\\tau) - \\mathbf x, \\mathbf w_i \\rangle \\right|^2  \n\\leq\n\\left|\\langle \\mathbf w_i,\\mathbf x_i\\rangle \\right|^2 [  (1-\\eta \\sigma_i^2)^\\tau  + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{SNR}_i}} ( (1-\\eta \\sigma_i^2)^\\tau  -1 )  ]^2\n+ \\epsilon.\n$$\nHere, $\\mathrm{SNR}_i = \\left|\\langle \\mathbf w_i,\\mathbf x\\rangle \\right|^2 / \\left|\\langle \\mathbf w_i,\\mathbf z \\rangle \\right|^2$ is the signal-to-noise ratio of a particular spatial frequency.

We have rewritten section 4.1 entitled ``Multilayer networks and moderate over-parameterization'' to point out limitations of this approach. Our results do not show a benefit of non-linear methods over linear ones. Specifically, our results explain why fitting a convolutional generator enables denoising a low-frequency signal, but does not explain why it denoises better in practice than a linear methods (such as thresholding). That said, we believe that our approach serves as a starting point to understand the more nonlinear behavior by tracking how the Jacobian matrix changes across time. That is, we hope to analyze the nonlinear case by successive linearization at different iterations in the future.\n\nEmpirical results: We agree that the exact parameters of the empirical results are important and have therefore made available all our code to reproduce the figures here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vtvavzry9sp5wrj/overparameterized_convolutional_generators-master.zip?dl=0\n\nWith respect to comparisons with BM3D we have added a new appendix section with more quantitative experiments showing that neural networks based techniques can work better than BM3D. We were not aware of this particular BM3D variant mentioned by the reviewer, thanks for pointing this out. We were not able to compare with the particular variant of BM3D mentioned by the reviewer thus far as we could not find the code online and hence were not able to compare in the response period until now. We are happy to make such comparisons in the final version of the manuscript. That said, we would like to emphasize that in this paper we are not trying to say neural networks give the best performance for denoising (although the deep image prior paper and numerous other publications suggest this). Our goal in this paper is to begin to understant why they work so well and understand their behavior and limitations for denoising even if they might not be the best performing approach for a specific image or signal.\n\nMinor comments:\nFigure 1: ``[denoising performance, ordering of algorithms] maintained on a large test set of images'': We have added a section in the appendix (appendix A) explaining the experiment, and providing the number. Also, we have made the code available which enables reproducing the experiments.\nSection 1.1: We fixed the typos, thanks for pointing them out.\nSection 2.3: We agree that while the optimum is the same, the dynamics of gradient descent might be slightly different. However, our numerical results show that the phenomena that lower frequency components are fitted faster than high frequency ones can be reliably observed in both of those two extremely similar models.\nSection 4: ``This in turn implies that the Jacobian spectrum throughout training decreases rapidly'': We removed the sentence as the `throughout training' was misleading. What is correct is that the Jacobian spectrum at initialization decays rapidly. \nSection 4: As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a paragraph at the end of section 4 explaining the proof.\n", "title": "Response to review 3"}, "B1eSQejdoS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJxWlnNpFB", "comment": "Thanks for reviewing our paper and the comments.\n\nQuestion 1, regarding the effect of bias: In the model that we study theoretically, the output is given by relu(U C') v'. A corresponding model with bias would be relu(U C + B) v, where B is a matrix where each column is equal to a constant. In this model with biases each channel, i.e., each column of U C + B, would have its own independent bias. Both models are equivalent. To see this, note that because U has full rank, we can use every other channel to add a constant, i.e., there is a choice of coefficients c_i for a given channel i so that [b_i, b_i, \u2026., b_i] = U c_i. A similar argument can be made for the deep decoder with multiple layers.\n\nQuestion 2, family of noise types: Our results as stated pertain to additive noise, but do not assume a particular distribution. Specifically, Theorem 2 shows that any component of the signal that is high-frequency is fitted later than the low-frequency components and thus any high-frequency component will be filtered out. So if a multiplicative noise adds high frequencies (such as speckle noise), then such noise components are filtered out as well.\n\nQuestion 3: Our analysis unfortunately does not shed light on why a trained network performs worse than  a random one. Two comments on that: \ni) Suppose we train a network end to end for denoising. If the image to be denoised comes from the same distribution as the images the network has been trained on, it can perform better than our method that assumes no prior knowledge on the images.\nii) Our results rely on the network being randomly initialized. We have carried out simulations where we first optimize on one image and then plug in another, and that can hurt performance slightly. So initializing randomly is a good choice, both in theory and practice.\n\nNotes: Thanks for the notes, we proofread the manuscript and fixed typos and a broken reference.

We have incorporated this by adding the following paragraph in the introduction and the main part:\n``Note that a smooth signal is a good model for a natural image since natural images are well approximated by low-frequency components. Specifically, Figure 4 in (Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001) shows that the power spectrum of a natural image (i.e., the energy distribution by frequency) decays rapidly from low frequencies to high frequencies. In contrast, Gaussian noise has a flat power spectrum.''\n\nOn the comment that ``the theoretical result mainly highlights the fact that natural images have a low-pass spectrum, while white noise has a flat spectrum, and CNNs using interpolation also have a low-pass spectrum in some senses'': We agree that the main theoretical contribution is to show that CNNs with interpolating filters fit a natural image faster than noise by showing that it fits the lower-frequency components faster than high frequency ones. The novelty of our contribution is to i) rigorously prove that low-frequency components are fitted faster than high-frequency ones and ii) to attribute this effect to the convolution with interpolation filters.  Both contributions i and ii are new. That said, we emphasize that our results continue to explain denoising performance even if the noise does not have a completely flat spectrum as discussed on page 3. Our denoising result holds as long as the noise is not too low pass (but doesn\u2019t have to be approximately flat).\n\nOn the trigonometric basis functions: The trigonometric basis functions arise in our results because they are the left-singular vectors of a circulant matrix. As such, they are the unique choice for the left-singular vectors. Note that the Fourier basis diagonalizes a circulant matrix, but it is not equivalent to the left-singular vectors of a circulant matrix. Thus we cannot substitute the trigonometric basis functions with the Fourier basis vectors as suggested by the reviewer. Note that those basis functions are different objects in that one is a basis for real-valued vectors and the other for complex valued vectors.\n\nOn triangular smoothing functions: We fully agree that triangular and Gaussian functions and their spectrum are discussed in the signal processing community. Note that our results do not depend on the Fourier transform of the kernels but on the associated weights/dual kernel defined in Definition 2.\n\nMinor comments: Many thanks for the comments, we have \ni) fixed the citations from cite to citep,\nii) fixed the broken link to the figure,\niii) changed Figure 7 so that each sub-plot is plotted on the same y-axis,\niv) and fixed the two typos on page 1.", "title": "Response to reviewer 1"}, "H1xrIN8NYH": {"type": "review", "replyto": "HJeqhA4YDS", "review": "The paper provides a theoretical study of regularization capabilities of over-parameterized convolutional generators trained via gradient descent, in the context of denoising with an approach similar to the \"deep image prior\".\nThe authors show that when using appropriate upsampling operators, gradient descent biases the reconstructed images towards low-frequency components, while the noise components, which typically consist of high-frequency patterns, take longer to fit, so that early stopping can provide a useful bias for denoising.\nThe proofs are based on recent results for \"lazy\" training of over-parameterized networks, namely neural tangent kernels.\n\nI find the paper interesting and novel, as it is the first to my knowledge to study the implicit bias of optimization for such generator-based denoising approaches, and provides interesting theoretical and empirical denoising results.\nWhile the current results are for a simple architecture with one hidden layer, they may pave the way for a formal study of more complex architectures.\nNevertheless, the paper presents some limitations which should be addressed further in the paper:\n\n* in terms of denoising capabilities, it seems that the results for the non-linear, over-parameterized network are essentially similar to the linear case (with an appropriately designed operator J in Section 3).
