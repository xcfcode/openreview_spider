However, high efficiency of these methods depends on large training and validation sets, while the acquisition of ground-truth labels is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, a graph view-consistent learning network (GVCLN) is specially designed for the semi-supervised learning when the number of the labeled samples is very small. We fully exploit the neighborhood aggregation capability of GVCLN and use dual views to obtain different representations. Although the two views have different viewing angles, their observation objects are the same, so their observation representations need to be consistent. For view-consistent representations between two views, two loss functions are designed besides a supervised loss. The supervised loss uses the known labeled set, while a view-consistent loss is applied to the two views to obtain the consistent representation and a pseudo-label loss is designed by using the common high-confidence predictions. GVCLN with these loss functions can obtain the view-consistent representations of the original feature. We also find that preprocessing the node features with specific filter before training is good for subsequent classification tasks. Related experiments have been done on the three citation network datasets of Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. On several node classification tasks, GVCLN achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The authors consider view-consistency when learning graph neural networks.

What we use in our paper is the consistency between the two views, instead of constructing positive and negative pairs by data enhancement as contrastive learning, that is\uff0cour paper is quite different from contrastive learning model. Therefore, the similarity to contrastive learning mentioned in your comment does not hold. As for self-training, our method is indeed used.  We use self-training to extract pseudo-labels to provide sufficient guidance for model training, but our purpose of using self-training is to provide consistency to the model. Regarding the second shortcoming mentioned in your comment, we think you may have misunderstood it. What we express in the paper is that the existing methods require a large number of known label nodes for training, and our proposed method can perform efficiently in the case of label scarcity, but it is not effective on large graphs as you said.", "title": "Response to Reviewer 5"}, "nBTVc3lIVPD": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H0X9-xH8ZG1", "comment": "First of all, thank you for your valuable comments on our paper.

[Introduction & Related work] We introduced some existing papers based on spectral methods and non-spectral methods, and introduced some methods related to our papers. But there is really a lack of introduction to the development of the entire graph neural network. [Model architecture] Our model uses a three-headed representation. This is because we have found in experiments that using three-headed representation and randomly discarding can make the network retain more useful representation information and prevent over-fitting. The difference between view 1 and view 2 is mainly reflected in the first half, so the final output layer, we use clique convolution layer. For the setting of the volume layer, we have a detailed introduction in the \"Settings\" of the experiment.
