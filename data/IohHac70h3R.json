We want to clarify the following.\n\nYou are definitely correct about the analysis part. Thank you for being such a careful reader. However, as we mention to another reviewer, the regret bound of AdaGrad also has the form of eqn (3), i.e. $O(\\sqrt{T})$, which has $h_{T,i} = \\frac{||g_{1:T, i}||}{\\sqrt{T}} + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is added to avoid division by zero. We are aware that $\\sqrt{T} \\frac{||g_{1:T, i}||}{T}$ gives an $O(||g_{1:T, i}||)$ bound, however there is an extra $\\epsilon$ term. Some recent work have shown that this $\\epsilon$ term is actually important in the construction of adaptive methods, for example [1], so it cannot be simply ignored. Another reason is that recent variants of Adam (AMSGrad, NosAdam etc) have regret bounds of form (3), and their $h_{T,i}$ cannot be easily written as a function of $||g_{1:T, i}||$, so it\u2019s hard to compare them with AdaGrad. In fact, the regret bounds of these algorithm have the form of $O(\\sqrt{T} + \\sqrt{1+\\log T}  {||g_{1:T, i}||})$, which is the same as our worst case (Thm 4.2). However, in practice we observe that they are actually at least as fast as AdaGrad, which further proves our claim that the regret is determined by the first term in equation (3) (the $O(\\sqrt{T}) $ part).

We want to clarify the following points\nThe assumption of a bounded domain is commonly used in the literature of adaptive algorithms, so we simply follow this assumption in our theory. Please check [1] [2] [3] for examples of this assumption. \n\nThe regret of most adaptive algorithms have the form of equation (3), including AdaGrad that has $h_{T,i} = \\frac{||g_{1:T, i}||}{\\sqrt{T}} + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is added to avoid division by zero. We are aware that $\\sqrt{T} \\frac{||g_{1:T, i}||}{T}$ gives an $O(||g_{1:T, i}||)$  term, however there is an extra $\\epsilon$ term. Some recent work has shown that this $\\epsilon$ term is actually important in the construction of adaptive methods, for example [4]. That is one reason why we consider a general form of equation (3) as this epsilon cannot be simply ignored. Another reason is that recent Adam variants (AMSGrad, NosAdam) have regrets of the form (3). Their $h_T$ cannot be easily written as a function of ${||g_{1:T, i}||}$, so it would be hard to compare them with AdaGrad. In fact, the regret bound of AMSGrad (and many other algorithms) is $O(\\sqrt{T} + \\sqrt{1+\\log T} {||g_{1:T, i}||})$, which is the same as our worst-case (Thm 4.2). However, in practice, we observe that they are actually at least as fast as AdaGrad, which further shows our claim that the regret is actually determined by the first term in equation (3) (the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ part). Our algorithm improves this $O(\\sqrt{T})$ term to be $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\tau})$, that\u2019s why we believe it\u2019s a true improvement.\n\nIn summary, you are absolutely correct about the second term in our regret bound (Thm 4.2) might be larger than that of AdaGrad. However, we believe that the dominating term is the first term of size $O(\\sqrt{T})$ and hence our algorithm improves over the others. But we will definitely try to prove a better bound in the future.\n\nAs we have emphasized in our paper, the regret in the example can be considered as the regret increment in real training processes, i.e., the regret increment will be very small after $\\tau$ in real situations, but you are definitely correct that showing where $\\tau$ is and how it behaves can help with our argument. We will absolutely consider how to show that in future versions of our paper.\n\n[1]. John Duchi, Elad Hazan, and Yoram Singer.

The reason behind it is that the marginal increment of these algorithms is not minimized, i.e. $h_{t,i} /\\alpha_t \u2013 h_{t-1, i}/\\alpha_{t-1} > 0 $ at each time step t.  Therefore the telescopic sum in Theorem 2.1 always reaches $ h_{T,i} /\\alpha_T = \\sqrt{T} h_{T,i} /\\alpha$, which gives an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ term. However, our method provides a way of \u201cearly stopping\u201d, i.e. the telescopic sum stops to increase after $\\tau$, that\u2019s the reason why our method generates a regret that depends on $\\tau$ instead of $T$.\n\nYou are absolutely correct about AMX not converging faster than AMSGrad in Fig. 2. We have turned over many parameter settings and we are reporting the parameter settings with the highest testing accuracy. The reason why AMX cannot be faster than AMSGrad maybe because the $\\tau$ in CIFAR tasks is very large so that the AMX cannot converge very fast in the beginning. However, you can see AMX does catch up with the other methods after the second learning rate decrease, proving our claim that it is at least as fast as the other methods (and it can be potentially even faster)\n\nThank you for pointing out that we need to compare it with more recent methods.

The reason why we consider the one-step increment of the regret is that only the gradient in the next step is available, i.e. we don\u2019t know what is going to happen in the future.  The motivation of using future information is actually explored by AdaGrad, where their design is a hind-sight best solution, i.e. after we know all the gradients. Using a longer step window is somewhere between our method and AdaGrad, but we will definitely think about it in the future.\n\nThe usage of full matrix proximal functions may be beneficial, and we include some discussions in Appendix B.

The idea of minimizing marginal regret bound is novel and interesting.\n\u00a0\n2. The paper provides rigorous theoretical proofs for many claims, but also generalizes in a clever way (AMX generalizes Equation 5) to potentially enhance performance.\n\u00a0\n3. Th paper provides experiments on a variety of tasks in different domains including computer vision and language. The results are very encouraging, as the proposed method is shown to converge either faster or better in most cases compared to other commonly used adaptive algorithms. The paper explains in details how the experiments are done, including relevant parameters and training procedure.\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\u00a0\n\n1. The paper shows better bound by introducing a quantity $\\tau$ which denotes the largest time steps something happens, and then Corollary 4.1 shows regret bound is roughly $\\sqrt{\\tau}$. Since $\\tau$ is at most T, the paper claims that the bound is better than bounds for other adaptive algorithms, which is simply $\\sqrt{T}$. However, I am not convinced that this can only be done for AMX, but not for other adaptive algorithms like Adam or AMSGrad. In other words, what is preventing us from defining $\\tau$ in a similar or different way, and then show a bound in terms of $\\tau$ for Adam or AMSGrad?\n\n2. The main theoretical insights is that AMX can converge faster than other adaptive algorithms. However, in many experiments AMX did not converge faster than Adam or AMSGrad (e.g. Figure 2). Instead, we often see that the test performance of AMX is better than other adaptive algorithms, i.e., AMX converges to a solution that generalizes better. In this sense, there is a misalignment between theory and practice.\n\n3.

However, I have the following concerns mainly on the theories. \n\n- The theories require a bounded domain, yet it is not justified. \n- \"*The AMX algorithm is at least as fast as AdaGrad and AMSGrad under the same assumptions*\": The regret of AdaGrad is ($\\frac{D^2}{\\alpha} + \\alpha)\\sum_{i=1}^d ||g_{1:T,i}||$ under the same setting. While for AMX, the construction of h_t potentially decreases the first term in the regret but also brings an extra log factor to the second term.  In fact,  the second term in Theorem 4.1 is ~$\\sum_{i=1}^d(\\sqrt{1+\\log\\tau}||g_{1:\\tau,i}||)$.  Overall, since that there is no clue how large $\\tau$ is, the regret of AMX may be worse than $\\sum_{i=1}^d||g_{1:T,i}||$ when $\\tau$ is close to $T$. Indeed,  the bound in Theorem 4.2 is worse than AdaGrad by a log term. \n- \"*We emphasize that a small $\\tau$ is not an assumption on the gradient distribution, but rather a condition that on satisfied.*\": There is no citation for this statement nor evidence showing that it is actually happening in the real training process. There is only a specific example to show $\\tau$ can be 1, but I'm still not convinced.  Small $\\tau$ is the key point to show the potential superiority, it would be better to illustrate how $\\tau$ behaves in real training.    \n\n\n", "title": "recommend to reject", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "PDJC_M4XN9R": {"type": "review", "replyto": "IohHac70h3R", "review": "The paper proposes a variant of AdaGrad which optimizes greedily the increase of the regret per trial. More precisely, it optimizes diagonal matrices which adaptively determines the regularizer of the composite mirror descent updates. The experimental results shows that the convergence speed is comparable to other state-of-the-arts, but often it achieves better test performances. \n\nThe proposed update makes sense and seems natural. However, the modification seems a bit incremental. The authors pointed out the proposed algorithm achieves potentially better regret bound than typical \\sqrt{T} and this is the first algorithm to do so. I am afraid that that is not correct. In the online convex optimization literature, there are bunch of researches on learning on \"easy data\", which aims to obtain better worst case regret bounds by taking advantage of \u201ceasyness\u201d in the data. In fact, there are many papers on that topic (see, e.g., NIPS workshop on Learning faster from easy data II in 2015 and following work). \n\nIt is not clear to me why the proposed method achieves better test performances in the experiments.

The algorithm is based on online mirror descent with non-decreasing quadratic regularizers $x^\\top H_t x$, using the update $x_{t+1} = argmin_x \\langle g_t, x \\rangle + (x-x_t)^\\top H_t(x-x_t)$ (or, equivalently using the terminology in the paper, $argmin \\langle g_t, x_t\\rangle /\\sqrt(t) + (x-x_t)^\\top H_t(x-x_t)$ where we replace $H_t$ by $H_t/\\sqrt{t}$. The analysis is restricted to diagonal $H_t$, for which we can break the regret into a sum of $d$ 1-dimensional problems, so it suffices to do the analysis in the scalar case. The idea is to break out the standard analysis of mirror descent regret as the sum over all t of $D^2(H_t - H_{t-1}) + g_t^2 H_t^{-1}$, where $D$ is the $\\ell_\\infty$ diameter of the domain, and then choose $H_t$ to minimize each of these terms greedily subject to the non-decreasing condition. A regret bound is provided for this algorithm that achieves worst-case $\\sqrt{T}$ regret, but in cases in which the gradients are small, the regret is much better. By employing this strategy on a per-coordinate basis one can obtain an adagrad-esque regret bound.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the algorithm is equivalent to the update:\n$$\nx_{t+1} = argmin_x \\langle g_t, x\\rangle + (x-x_t)^2 max_{t\u2019 \\le t} \\sqrt{t\u2019}|g_t\u2019|\n$$\nWhere I remove the composite term and consider 1-d problems for simplicity.\n\nThe analysis seems correct here, and the idea is a good approach. However, I am a bit concerned about the quality of the theoretical results obtained. In particular, it is extremely unclear to me that the main regret bound in Theorem 4.1 actually offers any advantage whatsoever over AdaGrad. In the paragraphs following the result, the authors offer the example in which $g_t = O(1/\\sqrt{t})$. The authors then observe that in this setting, AdaGrad will obtain $O(\\sqrt{\\log(T)})$ regret. They then also note that Theorem 4.1 obtains regret $\\ll \\sqrt{T}$. This is true, but my reading of theorem 4.1 is that it will have $O(\\log(T))$ regret, which is *worse* than AdaGrad by a $\\sqrt{\\log(T)}$ factor.\nI am not sure what is happening in Figure 1- my understanding is that this is plotting the analytical regret bound which seems actually smaller for AdaGrad using the provided example. I suspect the learning rates for adagrad are not tuned properly, but perhaps I am missing something.\n\nI have been unable to conceive of any sequence of gradients in which theorem 4.1 actually outperforms AdaGrad, and it is very easy to find sequences in which it does much worse (e.g. simply reverse the sequence of gradients in the provided example). It is, however, plausible to me that in reasonable settings in which the gradients decrease over time one might expect the bound to be within a constant (or maybe a log factor) of AdaGrad\u2019s bound.\n\nLooking at the analysis, I suspect that this is a fundamental issue with the approach of bounding bregman divergences based on the diameter of the domain. Once we commit to this, it is clear that the final regret bound must be at least on the order of $D^2H_T$ by telescoping sum, since $H_T$ is increasing. Further, the $\\sum_t g_t^2H_t^{-1}$ term can be lower-bounded by $\\sum g_t^2 H_T^{-1}$. Clearly, the minimizing value for $H_T$ here is then $D\\sqrt{\\sum g_t^2}$ to yield a bound of O(D \\sqrt{\\sum_t g_t^2}), which is exactly what AdaGrad does.\n\nI am willing to believe that the analysis can be improved here, but I am pretty sure that one cannot due so by bounding the Bregman divergences with the diameter. This leads to a pleasant telescoping sum, but I think AdaGrad may already optimize that style of analysis.\n\nAs for the empirical results, these seem a bit more promising so perhaps there is some improved analysis that could be made. There could be a few clarifications here though: is the value for $\\alpha_t$ set to $\\alpha/\\sqrt{t}$ in these experiments, or is it tuned via some other schedule? In analysis of Adam and AMSGrad, the authors typically use the $\\alpha/\\sqrt{t}$ approach, but in practice I think this is not usually employed. If $\\alpha_t$ is set via some other schedule, and momentum is used as well, then it becomes unclear if the $\\alpha$ tuning and the momentum is not what is providing the gain over AdaGrad rather than other differences.\n\nI am less expert in evaluating the significance of the final numbers in the empirical study. They do seem relevant, but frankly I feel that the theoretical discussion is currently dragging the paper down quite a bit.\n\n\n", "title": "Interesting idea, some concerns about theoretical comparison to prior work.", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}}}
