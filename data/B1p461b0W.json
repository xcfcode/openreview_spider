However, since well-annotated datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to collect, recent work has explored the use of larger but noisy datasets that can be more easily obtained. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of deep neural networks on training sets with massively noisy labels. We show on multiple datasets such as MINST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet that successful learning is possible even with an essentially arbitrary amount of noise. For example, on MNIST we find that accuracy of above 90 percent is still attainable even when the dataset has been diluted with 100 noisy examples for each clean example. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when noisy labels are biased towards confusing classes. Further, we show how the required dataset size for successful training increases with higher label noise. Finally, we present simple actionable techniques for improving learning in the regime of high label noise.", "keywords": ["label noise", "weakly supervised learning", "robustness of neural networks", "deep learning", "large datasets"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper studies the robustness of deep learning against label noise on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. But the generalization of the claim \"deep learning is robust to massive label noise\" is still questionable due to the limited noise types investigated.\nThe paper presents some tricks to improve learning with high label noise (batch size and learning rate), which is not novel enough.\n"}, "review": {"B1STvPVyG": {"type": "review", "replyto": "B1p461b0W", "review": "The paper makes a bold claim, that deep neural networks are robust to arbitrary level of noise. It also implies that this would be true for any type of noise, and support this later claim using experiments on CIFAR and MNIST with three noise types: (1) uniform label noise (2) non-uniform but image-independent label noise, which is named \"structured noise\", and (3) Samples from out-of-dataset classes. The experiments show robustness to these types of noise. \n\nReview: \nThe claim made by the paper is overly general, and in my own experience incorrect when considering real-world-noise. This is supported by the literature on \"data cleaning\" (partially by the authors), a procedure which is widely acknowledged as critical for good object recognition.  While it is true that some image-independent label noise can be alleviated in some datasets, incorrect labels in real world datasets can substantially harm classification accuracy.\n\nIt would be interesting to understand the source of the difference between the results in this paper and the more common results (where label noise damages recognition quality). The paper did not get a chance to test these differences, and I can only raise a few hypotheses. First, real-world noise depends on the image and classes in a more structured way. For instance, raters may confuse one bird species from a similar one, when the bird is photographed from a particular angle. This could be tested experimentally, for example by adding incorrect labels for close species using the CUB data for fine-grained bird species recognition.  Another possible reason is that classes in MNIST and CIFAR10 are already very distinctive, so are more robust to noise. Once again, it would be interesting for the paper to study why they achieve robustness to noise while the effect does not hold in general. \n\nWithout such an analysis, I feel the paper should not be accepted to ICLR because the way it states its claim may mislead readers. \n\nOther specific comments: \n-- Section 3.4 the experimental setup, should clearly state details of the optimization, architecture and hyper parameter search. For example, for Conv4, how many channels at each layer? how was the net initialized? which hyper parameters were tuned and with which values? were hyper parameters tuned on a separate validation set? How was the train/val/test split done, etc. These details are useful for judging technical correctness.\n-- Section 4, importance of large datasets. The recent paper by Chen et al (2017) would be relevant here.\n-- Figure 8 failed to show for me. \n-- Figure 9,10, need to specify which noise model was used.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Bold claims, but in contrast to observations with large-scale real-world data.

They perform experiments of label noise in a uniform setting, structured setting as well provide some heuristics to mitigate the effect of label noise such as changing learning rate or batch size. \n\nAlthough, the observations are interesting, especially the one on MNIST where the network performs well even with correct labels slightly above chance, the overall contributions are incremental. Most of the observations of label noise such as training with structured noise, importance of larger datasets have already been archived in prior work such as in Sukhbataar et.al. (2014) and Van Horn et. al (2015). Agreed that the authors do a more detailed study on simple MNIST classification, but these insights are not transferable to more challenging domains. \n\nThe main limitation of the paper is proposing a principled way to mitigate noise as done in Sukhbataar et.al. (2014), or an actionable trade-off between data acquisition and training schedules. \n\nThe authors contend that the way they deal with noise (keeping number of training samples constant) is different from previous setting which use label flips. However, the previous settings can be reinterpreted in the authors setting. I found the formulation of the \\alpha to be non-intuitive and confusing at times. The graphs plot number of noisy labels per clean label so a alpha of 100 would imply 1 right label and 100 noisy labels for total 101 labels. In fact, this depends on the task at hand (for MNIST it is 11 clean labels for 101 labels). This can be improved to help readers understand better. \n\nThere are several unanswered questions as to how this observation transfers to a semi-supervised or unsupervised setting, and also devise architectures depending on the level of expected noise in the labels. \n\nOverall, I feel the paper is not up to mark and suggest the authors devote using these insights in a more actionable setting. \nMissing citation: \"Training Deep Neural Networks on Noisy Labels with Bootstrapping\", Reed et al.\n", "title": "Learning with Noisy data.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "BkC-glk-M": {"type": "review", "replyto": "B1p461b0W", "review": "The problem the authors are tackling is extremely relevant to the research community. The paper is well written with considerable number of experiments. While a few conclusions are made in the paper a few things are missing to make even broader conclusions. I think adding those experiments will make the paper stronger! \n\n1. Annotation noise is one of the biggest bottleneck while collecting fully supervised datasets. This noise is mainly driven by lack of clear definitions for each concept (fine-grained, large label dictionary etc.). It would be good to add such type of noise to the datasets and see how the networks perform.\n2. While it is interesting to see large capacity networks more resilient to noise I think the paper spends more effort and time on small datasets and smaller models even in the convolutional space. It would be great to add more experiments on the state of the art residual networks and large datasets like ImageNet.\n3. Because the analysis is very empirical and authors have a hypothesis that the batch size is effectively smaller when there are large batches with noisy examples it would be good to add some analysis on the gradients to throw more light and make it less empirical.  Batch size and learning rate analysis was very informative but should be done on ResNets and larger datasets to make the paper strong and provide value to the research community.\n\nOverall, with these key things missing the paper falls a bit short making it more suitable for a re submission with further experiments.", "title": "The paper talks about how various kinds of noise types and levels hurt various deepnets on different problems.

We agree with the reviewer that there are different types of noise depending on the granularity and size of the dataset dictionary.

In our work, we aim to measure precisely the effect of noisy annotations on classification performance, complementing prior work in which increasing noise simultaneously implied a decrease in clean data.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the excellent question, on how our experiments capture the variability of natural, especially fine-grained, datasets. Our use of ImageNet, CIFAR, and MNIST was intended to capture several different paradigms of distinctiveness between classes. We consider noise which is class-dependent but image-independent - that is, two pictures from the same class are equally likely to be mislabeled, with no images being \u201cespecially confusing\u201d. Our interest in this formulation was in fact motivated by datasets used for fine-grained identification.\n\nWe observed that in the field, practitioners were using large datasets with abundant class-dependent errors, instead of occasional image-dependent errors. For example, a Google Image search for \u201cBlue Jay\u201d, a common species of bird, turns up many incorrect examples. Some are not birds at all (such as the similarly named baseball team). Of those that are, most are high-quality images of other species (such as the Steller\u2019s Jay). We do not observe a prevalence of ambiguous images among those that are falsely labeled.\n\nWe have addressed the specific comments in our revision.

As you mention, there has already been excellent work on these questions. Complementary to these lines of research, we aim to show that standard methods can work remarkably well even in the presence of high noise. Certainly, it is always better to have less noise; and if noise is present, then an explicitly noise-robust algorithm might provide better results. However, there are many circumstances in which ConvNets are naively applied without understanding the extent of noise in the data.  For such cases, we believe it is constructive to demonstrate the remarkable robustness of the \u201cvanilla\u201d training paradigm.\n\nWe respectfully disagree that prior experiments adequately consider the question of simultaneous large noise and large training set size. In prior work, we have found observations that performance decreases when good training examples are turned into bad ones. This is, however, unsurprising since it essentially represents a double attack: The signal is being diluted with noise *and* there is less total signal. We believe that to understand the robustness to label noise it is key to separate the two effects. To that end, we consider experiments in which the extent of the signal is fixed, but the dilution can be controlled. Specifically, we find that the likely explanation for the previously observed decreases in performance is that the datasets were too small to compensate for the noise.\n\nWe did indeed consider alternatives to alpha in parametrizing the extent of noise. As mentioned above, we chose this measurement because it allows us to keep the total amount of signal constant while varying the extent to which this signal is diluted. In light of your helpful comments, we have made some changes in the revision as to how this is described.\n\nWe have added the missing citation - thank you for drawing this to our attention.", "title": "Response to review"}, "ByRhoHM1G": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1pqnCHCZ", "comment": "Thank you for bringing this up.  Indeed, the difference between ResNets and CaffeNet likely makes a difference in the observed results. Further, in the referred paper, as in other prior work, an increase in noise comes at the expense of a smaller number of clean training examples. As we show in Section 4, this likely causes lower training performance than could be achieved over a large training set with the same level of noise.", "title": "Response re comparison of results"}}}
