Our goal is to enable semi-supervised ECG models to be made as well as to discover unknown subtypes of arrhythmia and anomalous ECG signal events. To this end, we propose an unsupervised representation learning task, evaluated in a semi-supervised fashion.  We provide a set of baselines for different feature extractors that can be built upon.  Additionally, we perform qualitative evaluations on results from PCA embeddings, where we identify some clustering of known subtypes indicating the potential for representation learning in arrhythmia sub-type discovery.", "keywords": ["representation learning", "healthcare", "medical", "clinical", "dataset", "ecg", "cardiology", "heart", "discovery", "anomaly detection", "out of distribution"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper introduces a new ECG dataset.

We are unable to include conditions associated with each patient.\n\n> How many technologists are involved in total? and what measure are taken to address the variances among different technologists?\n\nIn total there are 20 technologists (we\u2019ve updated the paper to include this). For each record, three technologists were involved. For more details see Section 4 paragraph 3.\nWe note that the annotations created by these technologists were then used in a medical diagnosis of the patient involved.\n", "title": "Thank you for your comments.

The dataset is collected from 11,000 patients and contains over 2.7 billion peaks. According to the cited works in section 2, the scale of this proposed dataset is unprecedented and will be beneficial to the ECG community.\n\nI think this is an interesting dataset for the ECG machine learning community. Some recent advances in this field are based on non-public dataset. However, this dataset seems to require additional curation before it is ready.\n\n\n\nQuestions. \nIn section 3, the authors discuss the potential concerns regarding privacy, what are the measures taken by the authors when collecting & distributing this dataset? I didn\u2019t find this question addressed in section 3.\n\nLike the authors stated in 2nd paragraph under section 4, this dataset is biased in the sense that it is collected from patients. The subjects are in the age group of 62.2 +/- 17.4. Do the authors recognized various chronicle conditions that often appear in that age group? Is that information part of the to-be-released dataset?\n\nSince this work focuses on releasing  a dataset, I find the current experiment section unnecessary & somewhat unrelated. What would be interesting to see is whether the authors use ML techniques to facilitate the curation of the dataset. For example, in paragraph 3 under section 4, it says each segment data is labeled by 3 technologists. How many technologist are involved in total? and what measure are taken to address the variances among different technologists?\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 2}}}
