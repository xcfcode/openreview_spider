We propose Sequential Residual Variational Autoencoder (SR-VAE) that defines a \"Residual learning\" mechanism as the training regime instead of the augmented objective function. Our proposed solution deploys two important ideas in a single framework: (1) learning from the residual between the input data and the accumulated reconstruction of sequentially added latent variables; (2) decomposing the reconstruction into decoder output and a residual term. This formulation encourages the disentanglement in the latent space by inducing explicit dependency structure, and reduces the bottleneck of VAE by adding the residual term to facilitate reconstruction. More importantly, SR-VAE eliminates the hyperparameter tuning, a crucial step for the prior state-of-the-art  performance using the objective function augmentation approach.  We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that SR-VAE improves the state-of-the-art  unsupervised disentangled representation learning on a variety of complex datasets.", "keywords": ["Disentangled Representation Learning", "Variational Autoencoder", "Residual Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper that defines a \u201cResidual learning\u201d mechanism as the training regime for variational autoencoder. The method gradually activates individual latent variables to reconstruct residuals.\n\nThere are two main concerns from the reviewers. First, residual learning is a common trick now, hence authors should provide insights on why residual learning works for VAE. The other problem is computational complexity. Currently, reviews argue that it seems not really fair to compare to a bruteforce parameter search.

Namely, for each input, the method involves making several (one per *each* embedding dimension) sequential passes, where each pass takes the residual between the input and the current accumulated output (i.e. pixel-wise difference between two images) as well as the values of the sampled embeddings so far. \nAuthors report quantitative and qualitative evaluation with a set of reasonable baselines (FactorVAE, beta-VAE), and the results seem to be slightly better.\n\nDecision:\nThe writing quality is not great: there are frequent typos and not-so-precise formulations, and is at times hard to follow (see list below).\nThe method itself is not really well-motivated: there seems to be no formal justification provided, and the informal one is not very clearly explained in the paper. \nScalability of the method is clearly an issue.

The formal justification of these issues was carefully discussed in theory among the cited prior works including: Section 2 of \u201cDisentangling by Factorising\u201d [Kim & Mnih (2018)] and Section 4 of \u201cUnderstanding disentangling in \u03b2-VAE\u201d [Burgess et al.(2017)]. In addition, we would like to clarify the main issue of learning of disentangled representation with VAE lies in the trade-off between the information bottleneck and the input reconstruction. Current approaches use augmented objective to address this problem. We propose to address this issue with a different training regime. We\u2019ve revised the manuscript in section 2 to cite the formal justification more clearly.  \n\nComputational Complexity ---> We agree with reviewer that the computation complexity of a single training process is longer comparing to other approaches. However, as discussed in Section 3 of our paper and highlighted in [Locatello et al, 2018], the current state-of-art approaches relies heavily on hyperparameter tuning that requires hundreds runs, potential years of GPU times to figure out the optimal solution. The proposed approach eliminates this search process, thus reduces the total computation. More importantly, the lack of quantitative metric for unsupervised disentanglement learning makes it hard to understand the effect of hyperparameter tuning (the current common evaluation is human visual inspection). We believe the proposed approach significantly reduces this effort by eliminating the hyperparameter search.   \nRegarding the comments \u201cMany applications might require the size of embeddings to have hundreds of dimensions\u201d, we agree that different applications require different latent space dimension. However, the idea of disentangled representation is to search for a compact (low dimension) representation space for real-world objects. This resembles human\u2019s capability to understand an object in a concise manner. For applications that involves complicated components, many recent work (e.g. Multi-Object Representation Learning with Iterative Variational Inference,  MONet: Unsupervised Scene Decomposition and Representation, GENESIS: Generative Scene Inference and Sampling with Object-Centric Latent Representations) focus on decomposing the scene into different components/objects/parts where each individual component can be modeled by a low-dimension disentangled representation. \n\nAdditional comments / typos --->\n* It would be worth seeing how this approach relates to auto-regressive models. \nThe proposed SR-VAE does resemble the non-linear autoregressive model for inference with the latent representation. It can be understood as the future z values are predicted based on the past z values along with the accumulated reconstruction. We have added this discussion to the related work section in the paper. \n\n* p2. \u201cencoder maps \u2026 x to a latent representation q\u201d - this sentence is not very strict.  \nIt would be great if the reviewer could provide details on the confusion and we are happy to address it accordingly.   \n\n* p7: \u201c\u2026 it reduces the solution space and improve training stability\u201c: is there any sort of theoretical reasoning that could support this? \nIn general limiting the search space does not necessarily improve the optimization results unless better local optimal solutions are in the constrained space. Since the optimal solution of the original VAE or beta-VAE satisfies the dependency constraints introduced in SR-VAE, we believe SR-VAE could help with reaching a better local optimal solution. Empirically, we observed that SR-VAE improves training stability by comparing the worst 10 runs out of 30 for 2D Shape in Fig 2(j)(k). We consistently observe better performance and smaller variances by SR-VAE. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the typos and grammar errors.

As a general learning method, residual learning has been applied to different domains ranging from discriminative models (ResNet), generative model (GAN), and reinforcement learning (relatively recent Residual RL). While the suggested reference by the reviewer carries the idea of iterative learning process, we believe the closest study to our work is the framework of \u201cDRAW\u201d [Gregor et al. (2015)]. Notice that \"DRAW\" is also cited in the recommended paper.

This work is heavily cited in our manuscript with its earlier arxiv version ([Locatello et al, 2018] in our paper). One of the key insights in this paper is: \u201ctheoretically prove that (perhaps unsurprisingly) the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases both on the considered learning approaches and the data sets.\u201d. This is indeed the motivation of our work. The proposed \u201cResidual learning\u201d forward pass serves as an inductive bias on the model to facilitate disentangled learning in VAE. It combines two important components of: 1) explicit dependency and 2) decomposition of reconstruction, to address the information bottleneck of disentanglement learning with VAE framework. To reduce the confusion, we updated our citation for  the work of Locatello et al from the arxiv version to the ICML version. We also modified Section 2 to emphasize this point.
