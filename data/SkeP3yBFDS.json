However, standard RNNs use the same amount of computation at each timestep, regardless of the input data. As a result, even for high-dimensional hidden states, all dimensions are updated at each timestep regardless of the recurrent memory cell. Reducing this rigid assumption could allow for models with large hidden states to perform inference more quickly. Intuitively, not all hidden state dimensions need to be recomputed from scratch at each timestep. Thus, recent methods have begun studying this problem by imposing mainly a priori-determined patterns for updating the state. In contrast, we now design a fully-learned approach, SA-RNN, that augments any RNN by predicting discrete update patterns at the fine granularity of independent hidden state dimensions through the parameterization of a distribution of update-likelihoods driven entirely by the input data. We achieve this without imposing assumptions on the structure of the update pattern. Better yet, our method adapts the update patterns online, allowing different dimensions to be updated conditional to the input. To learn which to update, the model solves a multi-objective optimization problem, maximizing accuracy while minimizing the number of updates based on a unified control. Using publicly-available datasets we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher accuracy with fewer updates compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, our method can be directly applied to a wide variety of models containing RNN architectures.", "keywords": ["recurrent neural networks", "conditional computation", "representation learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper introduces a new RNN architecture which uses a small network to decide which cells get updated at each time step, with the goal of reducing computational cost.  The idea makes sense, although it requires the use of a heuristic gradient estimator because of the non-differentiability of the update gate.\n\nThe main problem with this paper in my view is that the reduction in FLOPS was not demonstrated to correspond to a reduction in wallclock time, and I don't expect it would, since the sparse updates are different for each example in each batch, and only affect one hidden unit at a time.  The only discussion of this problem is \"we compute the FLOPs for each method as a surrogate for wall-clock time, which is hardware-dependent and often fluctuates dramatically in practice.\"  Because this method reduces predictive accuracy, the reduction in FLOPS should be worth it!\n\nMinor criticism:\n1) Figure 1 is confusing, showing not the proposed architecture in general but instead the connections remaining after computing the sparse updates.\n"}, "review": {"Byxm0iP5KH": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkeP3yBFDS", "review": "Summary: This paper proposes selective activation RNN (SA-RNN), by using an update coordinator to determine which subset of the RNN\u2019s hidden state dimensions should be updated at a given timestep. The proposed loss term is then a sum of the original objective (e.g. classification) and a weighted sum of the probability that each dimension will be updated for each timestep. The method is evaluated on 3 time series datasets: Seizures, TwitterBuzz, Yahoo. \n\nDecision: Weak Reject. Although the authors tackle a challenging problem, their empirical results are lacking to provably demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing baselines.\n\nSupporting Arguments/Feedback: The authors compare SA-RNN to 5 baselines: random updates, clockwork RNN, phased LSTM, Skip RNN, and VC-GRU. Although I appreciated the authors\u2019 comparison across the suite of methods with respect to various metrics (e.g. # FLOPS, proportion of neurons that weren\u2019t updated, etc.), the experiments were conducted on datasets that were relatively simple. For example, in prior work, the empirical evaluations were on much larger-scale datasets such as Wikipedia [Shen et. al 2019], real clinical data sources [Liu et. al 2018], and Charades videos [Campos et. al 2018], among others. I would be very interested to see how this training procedure fairs when evaluated on much more complex tasks, and would make the results about computational speedups at train/test time much more convincing.\n\nQuestions:\n- I\u2019m curious if you tried different types of gradient estimators to get around the non-differentiability rather than the straight-through estimator. Also how was the slope-annealing conducted (e.g. annealing schedule)?\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #2", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 1}, "BklWehDioS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Byxm0iP5KH", "comment": "Thank you very much for your constructive review. \n\nPer your suggestion, we have run further experiments on more complicated data that we hope will convince you of both the merit of our proposed method along with this line of research with respect to previous approaches. We revised the paper, adding a new section to the beginning of the appendix that describes the \u201cAdding\u201d task, which asks a network to learn to sum two values in a long sequence of sampled values given a mask indicating the indices to be summed, along with our results. We invite you to take a look at the new section but we highlight our main findings as follows:\n\nTo add a new perspective on complexity in our experiments we tested long-term dependencies as part of this new experiment, following the lead of the literature [1-3]. As shown in our Appendix, we found that even in the presence of extremely long-term dependencies (up to 500 timesteps), our proposed SA-RNN solves the task perfectly with a very low number of FLOPs and very few state updates compared to the other data-reactive method SkipRNN. As expected, the standard GRU also solves the task while Random Skips does not.\n\nRegarding your Gradient Estimation and Slope-Annealing question:\nIn our experiments, we used the straight-through estimator to be comparable to the literature, including [3] and [4].  Plus, we were pleased to have achieved our empirically-good results with these basic settings. However, we agree that this is an interesting question, as it is unlikely that the same estimator is the absolute best for all possible tasks. Thus, there is potentially room for further tuning by designing update pattern-specific gradient estimation. For slope-annealing we used the parameters and setting as described in [4], gradually increasing the slope of the hard sigma function as the model trains, starting at slope $\\alpha=1$ and increasing according to the schedule $a = \\min(5, 1+0.04*N_{epoch})$. We have added information about both of these settings to our experimental description in our paper to assure full reproducibility.\n\n[1] Henaff, M., Szlam, A., LeCun, Y. \u201cRecurrent Orthogonal Networks and Long-Memory Tasks\u201d, ICML 2015.\n[2] Neil, D., Pfeiffer, M., Liu, S.-C., \u201cPhased LSTM: Accelerating Recurrent Network Training for Long or Event-based Sequences\u201d, NeurIPS 2016.\n[3] Campos, V., Jou, B., Giro-i-Nieto, X., Torres, J., Chang, S.-F. \u201cSkipRNN: Learning to Skip State Updates in Recurrent Neural Networks\u201d, ICLR 2018.\n[4] Chung, J., Ahn, S., Bengio, Y. \u201cHierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Networks\u201d, ICLR 2017.", "title": "Reply to reviewer 2 - Thank you for thoughtful review"}, "rJgFtz44iB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJecY0BnFr", "comment": "We thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our work and your positive response to our proposed method and experimental results, especially given your expertise in the area.\n\nConcerning your suggestions to improve the presentation itself, we have undertaken a careful round of proof-reading to improve the readability of the manuscript.

To target the methodological differences between our compared methods, we compute and report the FLOPs instead. This is independent of hardware and implementation.
