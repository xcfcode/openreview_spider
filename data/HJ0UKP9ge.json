Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC. Typically these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the context and summarize it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions temporally, and/or often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we introduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage hierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of granularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain a query-aware context representation without early summarization. Our experimental evaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results in Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail cloze test.", "keywords": ["Natural language processing", "Deep learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The program committee appreciates the authors' response to concerns raised in the reviews.

Are those experiments-backed  or have solid theoretical reasoning ?\n\nTo begin with, I think it could have been made more clear behind the choice of similarity functions used - alpha and beta (using paper notations), mostly the choice of operands inside concatenations. For eg. while computing alpha, what might be the need of concatenating h and u when hadamard product of h and u alone might do the job. Moreover, while computing G, what is the reason behind using contextual embedding H and why U~ and H~ being attended embedding are not enough ?\n\nAlso, in the output layer, to predict the start index the probability distributions are computed using the concatenation of G and M. But why M is passed through a bi-LSTM to get M^2 and then used G and M^2 to predict the end index. I mean what is the intuition behind the bi-LSTM here. \n\nHowever, I found the Modeling Layer quite intuitive -- capturing interaction between context words which are already query-aware from the previous Attention Flow Layer!\n\n", "title": "Can't understand few intuitions behind some operations"}, "rkpxyGAKl": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJ0UKP9ge", "comment": "Final version uploaded:\n- fixed typos\n- more spacious formatting\n- added acknowledgments", "title": "Revised on 24 Feb 2017"}, "rJvGDEZ_x": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJ0UKP9ge", "comment": "- Added WikiQA Experiment (Appendix C for now), giving <2% higher performance than the previous SOTA without seeing any example on WikiQA, i.e. zero-shot scenario.\n- Voided the above revision, because zero-shot is a widely different experiment from the other QA experiments.", "title": "Revised on 2 Feb 2017; Voided on 6 Feb 2017"}, "r1hNca0rg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "ry5GeJBBx", "comment": "Thank you for spotting this!

We have incorporated this feedback in our latest revision and we discuss these changes below.\n\nNovelty of BiDAF: \nMost modern neural network models consist of standard elements, and how they are composed is often a major contribution. As pointed out by reviewers R2 and R3, the major novelties of our model are: the memory-less attention flow mechanism and the bi-directionality of the attention, as well as how they can be combined with other standard elements (Char-CNN, LSTM, etc.) to perform well in machine comprehension tasks.\n\nSecond paragraph of the introduction is unclear: \nWe have reworded the first and second paragraphs to make them more clear to readers. \n\n\u201cMost previous work summarizes each modality into a single vector\u201d is incorrect: \nWe meant that in most previous MC and QA works, the computed attention weights are often used to summarize the context (paragraph or image) into a single fixed-size vector, thus extracting the most relevant information from the context for answering the question. We realize that our previous wording could have been a bit confusing, and we have updated the paper accordingly.\n\n\u201cModeling layer\u201d: \nWe named it \u201cmodeling layer\u201d to merely indicate its functionality. This is similar to the nomenclature used for others layers in the network (similar to R1\u2019s suggestion on using the name \u201ccontextual embedding layer\u201d). We use RNNs in several different layers in the system, but they play different roles in different layers, and the names assigned to the different layers in the system indicate these roles.\n\n\u201cPhrase embedding layer\u201d: \nFollowing the suggestion, we have changed this to \u201ccontextual embedding layer\u201d.\n\nSection 2 point 4 needs citation for \u201cpopular\u201d: \nPlease note that Section 3 contains a detailed list of related work. In the current revision, we have now added citations to Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015) and three recent papers in machine comprehension tasks.\n\nOutput layer has changed to adapt to CNN/DailyMail: \nIn the current revision, we now mention in the introduction that we changed the output module for the CNN/DailyMail dataset.\n\nTypos and grammatical issues:\nWe have fixed several typos as well as grammatical issues throughout the paper. \n", "title": "Our response to R1's review"}, "S1VG9pRHe": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJ0UKP9ge", "comment": "Incorporated reviewers' and Kelly Zhang's suggestions:\n- Fixed typos / grammatical errors\n- \"phase embedding layer\" -> \"contextual embedding layer\"\n- Added more citation to Section 2\n- Reworded abstract and first two paragraphs of intro\n- Fixed Stanford AR reader's numbers", "title": "Revised on 7 Jan 2017"}, "ry5GeJBBx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJ0UKP9ge", "comment": "In Table 3 (Results), you cite Chen et al.'s Stanford AR reader performance on CNN and DailyMail, but I think the numbers are incorrect.
