These networks typically evolve according to certain laws, such as the law of triadic closure, which is universal in social networks. Inductive representation learning of temporal networks should be able to capture such laws and further be applied to systems that follow the same laws but have not been unseen during the training stage. Previous works in this area depend on either network node identities or rich edge attributes and typically fail to extract these laws. Here, we propose {\\em Causal Anonymous Walks (CAWs)} to inductively represent a temporal network. CAWs are extracted by temporal random walks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to represent network dynamics while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting of those motifs. CAWs adopt a novel anonymization strategy that replaces node identities with the hitting counts of the nodes based on a set of sampled walks to keep the method inductive, and simultaneously establish the correlation between motifs. We further propose a neural-network model CAW-N to encode CAWs, and pair it with a CAW sampling strategy with constant memory and time cost to support online training and inference. CAW-N is evaluated to predict links over 6 real temporal networks and uniformly outperforms previous SOTA methods by averaged 15\\% AUC gain in the inductive setting. CAW-N also outperforms previous methods in 5 out of the 6 networks in the transductive setting.", "keywords": ["temporal networks", "inductive representation learning", "anonymous walk", "network motif"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper introduces a new method for encoding dynamics of temporal networks.

The authors leverage the causal anonymous walk to capture the topological laws of the dynamic graph, while not requiring to memorize node identities such that inductive learning is still feasible. Compared with the previous work, the paper emphasizes on scenarios where node/edge attributes are less informative of the inductive reasoning. Some workaround methods are also proposed to deal with the edge features and to enable the efficient computation and sampling procedure. \n\nThe paper is overall well-written, and the motivations are justified clearly. The most relevant work of TGAT from Xu, et al. 2020 does not explicitly account for the dynamic laws of evolving graphs, and the way they construct and sample the local neighborhood is infeasible when processing large graphs in a streaming fashion. The authors leverage the causal anonymous walks to:\n\n1. capture the signals of topological structures which \"reflect\" the identities of the nodes;\n\n2. avoid the costly computations to recover the network structural features during both the training and inference.\n\nThe contribution is solid as it complements the TGAT when the node/edges features are less important. It also solves the computation issues of the TGAT. The numerical results also compare favorably to the baselines. \n\nMy concerns with the paper include:\n\n1. Using random walks and local aggregation methods (such as GCN, GAT, TGAT) have their different emphasis on the network topological laws & node/edge features. The authors should discuss and make it more clear regarding the pros and cons. \n\n2. It appears TGAT adopts the same inductive representation learning setting from GraphSAGE and GAT, which are widely accepted in this domain. The claim and key arguments made by the authors raise a major confusion about being inductive in graph representation learning, and I believe the criticisms here are equally applicable to GraphSAGE and GAT that leverage node features as well. Therefore, I think the notion of inductiveness studied by the authors is at most in parallel to that of TGAT (and GraphSAGE & GAT). If the authors believe their notion of inductiveness is more proper, they should discuss the similar issues for GraphSAGE and GAT since they are more well-known to the readers and will raise less confusion.\n\n3. the link sampling strategy that ensures the overall efficiency of the computation lacks support and is not principled. To some extent, neighborhood/walk construction in dynamic graphs are still open challenges in this domain, so I think using heuristics is fine, but the consequence should be made more clear.\n\nThe authors make the novel contribution of combining the causal anonymous walk with inductive representation on temporal graphs. However, their arguments on the notion of inductiveness can raise a major confusion if not directly discussed for GraphSAGE and GAT.

We especially thank R2 for clearly positioning the contributions of our approach, insightfully asking very fundamental questions. We address these questions as the follows. \n\n## Q1. \"The comparison between random walks and local aggregation methods\"\n* We agree the statement made by R2. In general, they have different emphasis. GCN, GAT, TGAT favor the case with very informative node features and node features smoothing. However, random walk methods more favor network dynamics representation. Our goal is to extract the network dynamics and therefore we adopt the more suitable random walk methods. Note that although most previous works on representation learning of temporal networks also focused on extracting the network dynamics (link prediction), they did not choose such more suitable (random walk) methods. We see this as one of our contributions. \n* More importantly, random-walk methods are also naturally suitable for the computation of relative node identities, which is critical to encode the network dynamics when node identities are removed and no informative node/edge attributes are available. \n\n## Q2. \"The notion of inductiveness\"\n* Regarding the notion of inductiveness, we are sorry for the caused confusion and have fixed our statement in the revised manuscript. Actually, in this paper, we still use the widely accepted definition of inductiveness in machine learning. That is, an inductive model can be applied to a testing dataset whose labels and features can never be used for training. Regarding this notion, we should say TGAT, GraphSAGE and GAT are all inductive. We can see in Table 2, the performance gap of TGAT between the inductive setting and the transductive setting is not huge. Therefore, TGAT is inductive. We fixed our argument in the revised manuscript. \n* However, the issue of TGAT is that it only performs well (even just in training datasets) when informative node features are available. GraphSAGE and GAT share the same issue. Therefore, in the section 2, we explicitly discuss the condition when TGAT fails, i.e., when informative node/edge attributes are not available. We also criticize GraphSAGE and GAT who will fail in a similar case. \n*Our CAW-N does not depend on informative node features to represent the network dynamics. Some interpretation and visualization results are also provided in Appendix E of the revised manuscript, where we illustrate some patterns of CAWs to indicate how CAW-N can work so well to represent network dynamics. \n\n## Q3. \"The link sampling strategy is not principled.\"\n* Regarding the argument that the link sampling strategy is just heuristic, we respectfully disagree. First, we argue that the link sampling strategy is not related whether the method is random walk or local aggregation. Therefore, it is an independent contribution and can also be used to improve local aggregation. \n* In appendix A, we have rigorous demonstration on why our sampling strategy does not need to record the entire history. Actually, when the entire history has to be recorded, as TGAT did, the memory complexity is O(|E|) and the time complexity is O(|E|^2). In practice, |E| increases with respect to time as new edges arrive. This may yield some practical issues of TGAT. In contrast, our approach does not need to record the entire history. Therefore, if the edges come in as a stream, our model only needs to record at most constant many recent edges for each node pair. The memory complexity will not increase when new edges come in and the time complexity of our model is O(|E|). We demonstrate the linear time complexity of our approach in Sec. 5.4.\n", "title": "Clarification of the notion of inductiveness and the link sampling strategy"}, "wFIgW-IKfHX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "8oL77rt82e9", "comment": "We thank R3 for the valuable comments on our paper. We specially thank R3 for notifying us of the missing conclusion and discussion section. We have provided the conclusion section in the revised manuscript. \n\nRegarding other concerns raised by the reviewer 3, however, we respectfully disagree. \n\n## Q1. \u201cComplexity of our counting vs motif counting\u201d\n**Our counting the numbers of nodes in different positions is far more efficient than counting temporal motifs.** \n* Note that for each edge used for training, the counting number in our case is in total 2Mm, where M is the number of walks for a node while m is the length of a walk. Both M and m are very small constants: In our experiments, the setting M=32 and m=3 in general achieves very good performance, though increasing M may slightly increase the performance. Our model is evaluated when M<=128 and m<=4 for all datasets. \n\n* However, counting temporal motif is much more complex. For every edge of interest, it needs to first track all the edges in the subgraph around this edge that appear in some predetermined time interval; Second it needs to solves graph isomorphism testing to decide the pattern of each motif that consist of the edges extracted in the previous step. The first step in general needs to track k edges, where k is hundreds or even thousands. Now we count the motifs: If we consider all the motifs with 2m edges (actually in our method, CAWs implicitly model motifs with up-to 2m edges, as CAWs establish the correlation between the walks of two nodes in a link), the related motif counting complexity is about O(k^{2m}). If we choose k=100, m=2, the complexity is about 10^8. Here, we even have not considered the complexity of solving the graph isomorphism problem for each motif. \n* To demonstrate the above arguement, we check the Wikipedia dataset: For an edge (u,v,t), we collect all the edges that appear within 2-hop neighborhood of either u or t and within time [t \u2013 0.05T, t], where T is the total time range. Then, we count the motifs that contain 4 edges and nodes u, v. The total number of these motifs for an edge (u,v,t) are 10^6 in average and 10^8 in the worst case. It is significantly larger than 2Mm(<10^3) which is the counting complexity in our method.  \n*Note that the motif counting method in [1] cannot be used here. Because we not only need to count the total number of motifs in the networks (the setting in [1]) but also count the motifs that contain a certain edge. That is, we need to locate each motif in the network multiple times. Therefore, the motif counting will be much more complex. Then, with such a high complexity, one may wonder how previous methods counted motifs to perform link prediction in temporal networks? The answer is that they are not scalable enough to work on the original edge streams as we are doing. They must first aggregate edges into network snapshots, which significantly decreases the number of the edges before performing motif counting (for example [2]). However, they will run into the issues of using network snapshots, which we have analyzed in the manuscript. \n\n## Q2.  \"High sensitivity of the hyperparameters\"\n**We respectfully disagree with R3. Our model with a wide range of hyperparameters keeps outperforming the baselines.** \n* The optimal ranges of hyperparameters are easy to be determined as how they impact the model is very interpretable. Please check the range of each y-axis in Fig. 5 and compare it with the inductive baselines in Table 2. We may conclude that in almost the entire ranges of all three hyperparameters, our method outperforms all baselines. We zoom in the range of each y-axis and focus on the most sensitive range to provide the clearest hyperparameter analysis for the readers. As the figure shows, the only problematic regime could be when alpha, the time bias, is too large. However, in practice, it is easy to decide the proper range of \\alpha as the reason why a large \\alpha does not work is very clear. A too large \\alpha makes the model always sample the most recent adjacent link, which loses much information and leads to bad performance. In practice, we may simply choose \\alpha ~ \\tau/c to avoid this issue, where \\tau is the edge intensity and c is a constant from about 5 to 10. This option is uniformly good for all the datasets used in this paper.  We further clarified this point in the updated version of the paper.\n\n[1] Ashwin Paranjape, Austin R Benson, and Jure Leskovec. Motifs in temporal networks.

We especially thank R 1 for appreciating the novelty of our approach and our experiments. We address the concerns raised by R1 as the follows. \n\n## Q1. \"The significance of the model vs the AW model\"\n* Regarding the significance, R1 seems to miss capturing the function of the set-based anonymization used in CAW that is significantly different from the anonymization procedure in AW, and thus incorrectly overlooked the significance of our CAW. CAW only shares a high-level similar idea with the AW approach but it works in a substantially different mechanism.\n\n* First, the problems that two methods (CAW and AW) aim to solve are significantly different. The previous AW approach was used for entire graph representation while our CAW approach is used to perform link prediction. The problem setting itself has been already more than just an extension from a static setting to a temporal setting. The difference in problem setting also leads to the fundamental difference between CAW\u2019s mechanism and AW\u2019s one. \n\n* Second, CAW can model the correlation of motifs, which is crucial to learn the network dynamics but AW cannot. In the manuscript, we have introduced two types of technical differences between CAWs and AWs. One is the way to extract walks, where CAWs use temporal random walk to encode causality. We would have agreed with the review 1 if we simply generalized AWs by performing temporal random walk and kept the remaining steps in the same way, which is a direct extension of AW by injecting temporal information into the model. However, we did much more than that. The above direct extension does not work well, as shown in our ablation study No. 5 in Table 3. This observation motivated us to propose the more significant contribution, the set-based anonymization adopted by CAW, which can model the correlation between the walks. AW-type anonymization will miss the correlation. Therefore, AWs hold the same issue as T-GAT and fail in the example shown in Fig. 3. But CAW-type anonymization is the key to solve that issue. We also provide visualization results in Appendix E to illustrate why the correlation captured by CAWs is very crucial. \n\n* To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous works proposing this idea, even just similar in the high level, to establish the correlation between walks/motifs. Our anonymization is simple, effective and extremely novel. Therefore, CAWs are significant improvement beyond AWs.\n\n## Q2. \"How does the model handle the entanglement of structural and temporal information?\"\n* Regarding the entanglement of structural and temporal information, we would like to further clarify this concept. The ideal solution to handle such a challenge is not to literally process structural and temporal information separately, as imagined by the reviewer 1. Essentially, these two sides of the information are mutually interacted. If we process them separately, we may lose useful information. Because these two sides need to be processed simultaneously and their correlation should be properly captured, the model design in general becomes very hard. Previous tools are either for structural information (such as GNN) or temporal information (such as RNN). Therefore, researchers must reduce such a complicated data structure into one of the above two cases. \n* Our approach, however, provides an elegant way to model both-side information. Specifically, we adopt temporal random walks that involve both structural and temporal information. The obtained walks reduce the data structure into a sequential format. Then, we use set-based anonymization to further inject structural information and further use RNNs to enhance temporal information. The design we adopted essentially injects structural and temporal information in an iterative manner. The exceptionally well experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to deal with the entanglement of structural and temporal information.\n\n## Q3. \"The details on the optimality of time encoding\"\nThe capability of Fourier features (adopted as the time encoding) to approximate any positive definite kernels seems to be a well-established result in statistical learning theory. As it is a direct result from previous works and due to the page limitation, we omit the detailed discussion on it and refers the previous related references. \n", "title": "Clarification of the significance of CAW-N and how we deal with structural and temporal information"}, "2fCdT0ISMcx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "uEKobAY-kxh", "comment": "We thank R4 for the valuable comments on our paper. We especially thank R4 for appreciating the novelty of our approach and our experiments. We address the concerns as the follows. \n## Q1. \u201cThe study of the model scalability\u201d\n* We provide the time complexity evaluation on our method in Sec. 5.4 in the revised manuscript, which demonstrates the statement that the time complexity of our model only linearly depend on the number of edges. Our model only needs constant time to sample the history for each edge, which is due to our link sample strategy in the appendix A. Our llink sample strategy is solid and the key to significantly decrease the time complexity from O(|E|^2) to O(|E|) in total, where |E| is the number of edges. \n \n## Q2. \u201cVisualization of the representations/patterns learnt by the model\u201d\n* Essentially, our method does not explicitly compute node representations. Therefore, we cannot provide the traditional node representation visualization. However, we may provide visualization on how CAW-N extracts the patterns to make successful link prediction. We put such results and analysis in Appendix E. The results show that CAW-N uses a law of motif closure to predict links. \n\n## Q3. \"Whether the authors break the double blind rules\"\n* Regarding the double blind rules for ICLR (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2021/CallForPapers), we do not think that the behavior of one of the authors' behavior (list the paper in his google scholar page) breaks the rules.

All the reviewers agreed that our causal anonymous walk method is a novel and effective approach to represent dynamics of temporal networks. All the reviewers also appreciated the extensive evaluation of our method by comparing with a wide range of baselines and providing complete ablation study to understand how different components contribute to the model. The reviewers also make several valuable and actionable suggestions which we will address in the revised version of the paper.

R3 has questions about the benefit of our complexity over the motif counting approach. R2 is confused about the significance of our link sampling strategy as opposed to the sampling strategy adopted by TGAT.\n\nTo address these concerns, we provide the evaluation on complexity in Sec. 5.4 in the revised manuscript. One quick answer to these questions is that the complexity of our CAW-N is O(|E|), or say \\beta E, where |E| is the number of edges and \\beta is some constant. The constant \\beta is determined by the number of walks M, the length of a walk m, the edge intensity \\tau and the time bias \\alpha, which finally results in only a small constant \\beta. In comparison, TGAT  needs to record the entire history and has time complexity O(|E|^2). The motif counting, as it depends on tracking different combinations of edges and solving graph isomorphism testing, has complexity in general poly(|E|), where the power order decides by the size of the motifs. Overall, our approach has low memory and time complexity, which is particularly good for long edge streams. In the revised manuscript, we provided Sec. 5.4 to evaluate the complexity of our approach. We keep detailed explanation of this point in the following response to the reviewers 2, 3 and 4.\n\n**Regarding methodology**, R1 wants to learn more about the significance of CAW as opposed to the previous AW approach. R2 would like to be clearer about the benefit of random-walk approaches and the notion of inductiveness.
