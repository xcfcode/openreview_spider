Most current approaches model this one-to-many task as a one-to-one task, hence being unable to integrate information from multiple semantically similar valid responses of a prompt. We propose a novel dialog generation model that learns a semantic latent space, on which representations of semantically related sentences are close to each other. This latent space is learned by maximizing correlation between the features extracted from prompt and responses. Learning the pair relationship between the prompts and responses as a regression task on the latent space, instead of classification on the vocabulary using MLE loss, enables our model to view semantically related responses collectively. An additional autoencoder is trained, for recovering the full sentence from the latent space. Experimental results show that our proposed model eliminates the generic response problem, while achieving comparable or better coherence compared to baselines.", "keywords": ["dialog", "chatbot", "open domain conversation", "CCA"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper proposes a response generation approach that aims to tackle the generic response problem.

We respond to the comments in your review below, and we will revise the paper to clarify those issues.\n\n - There seems to be a need for more detail on comparisons of papers that previously tackle the generic response problem.\n\nWe will revise the paper and add more discussion on previous work about the generic response problem.\n\n - In addition to the proposed main architecture, there are so many things combined (ex. denoising, attention). It seems like it's doing well with additional things rather than the model structure. In fact, the results of the model without denoising in the ablation study show poor performance.\n\nWe do not agree that using attention and denoising is a \u201cweakness\u201d. Most dialog generation models use attention. Also as shown in table 1, our model without attention still outperform other compared methods in human evaluation.\nSince other compared models could not be improved similarly by using denoising, it shouldn\u2019t be considered an \u201cadditional thing\u201d, but a critical part of our model instead. \n\n - The test pool for human-evaluation is too small (only 3 workers). It seems necessary to perform the human-evaluation on a larger number of participants. I think that it is a very important issue since the generic response addressed as the main problem in this paper can only be evaluated by human-evaluation. \n\nWe follow the standards of [1]~[4] to use 3 distinct workers per prompt-response pair. (Common range in literature is 3~5 workers)\nAlso we evaluate 500 pairs of sentences for each model, which is on the high side compared to previous work. (Common range is 100~500 pairs)\nNote that overall our evaluation involved a pool of around 400 distinct crowd-workers.\n[1]Louis Shao, Stephan Gouws, Denny Britz, Anna Goldie, Brian Strope, Ray Kurzwei, Generating High-Quality and Informative Conversation Responses with Sequence-to-Sequence Models\nEMNLP2017\n[2]Yahui Liu, Wei Bi, Jun Gao, Xiaojiang Liu, Jian Yao, Shuming Shi, Towards Less Generic Responses in Neural Conversation Models: A Statistical Re-weighting Method EMNLP2018\n[3]Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yixing Fan, YanyanLan, Jun Xu, and Xueqi Cheng.

If there are some criteria provided to the participants, it would be better to include a description together. \n\nFor specificity, the workers are asked to rate the utterances according to \u201chow specific and detailed the response is\u201d. They are instructed that \u201cA specific sentence provides information that relates uniquely to a particular subject. If the response contains both generic and specific parts, rate the most specific part\u201d. They are also provided example responses of each score 0~3 for that dataset.\n\nFor coherence, the workers are asked to rate \u201cif the response is relevant to the prompt\u201c. They are instructed that \u201cA response is relevant if part of it discusses a similar topic with part of to the prompt, answers a question asked in the prompt, or giving a suitable response to a situation. If other parts of the response are about a different topic, it is still considered coherent\u201d. They are also provided example prompt-response pairs for each score 0~3 for that dataset.\n\n\n- Can you provide an intuitive or theoretical explanation of denoising (to add a <unk>)?\n\nThe <unk> makes the decoder more robust, and able to generate grammatical responses when there is noise in the decoder input. This is important because the decoder input is from a different encoder during inference.\nAlso without denoising, the autoencoder will severely overfit, which is a main reason why it show poor performance\nFinally, the learned hidden representation would be more high-level, includiing semantic knowledge.

However, since there are no good alternatives, those metrics are still widely used in literature. The automatic metrics used in our work are also used in [4]~[7] and [1] , [2]. Since those metrics in [3] have very low correlation with human evaluation, they are not suitable for stopping criteria. Distinct also couldn\u2019t be used since it monotonically increases as the model overfits.\n\nBecause our model is optimized on the latent space, instead of trained as a probabilistic model that minimizes perplexity, the perplexity of the gold responses in our model is very large (10^3~10^4). Nontheless, our model outperforms baselines on human evaluation. This is why we don\u2019t use perplexity for evaluation as in ConvAI challenge. The other two metrics in the challenge are less often seen in the literature. F1 is similar to the BLEU we used.

Summary: The authors proposed to alleviate the generic response problem in open-domain dialog generation by generating a response to a prompt from a semantic latent vector. This vector needs to be located close to the latent vector of the corresponding prompt. To this end, they employ canonical correlation analysis and auto-encoder to learn the mapping from a sequence of text to a semantic latent vector. To model the variations and topic shifts that may happen in responses, they also use a separate intermediate vector in the auto-encoder of generating responses.\n2.
