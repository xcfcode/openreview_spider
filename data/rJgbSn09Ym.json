", "abstract": "Real-life control tasks involve matters of various substances---rigid or soft bodies, liquid, gas---each with distinct physical behaviors. This poses challenges to traditional rigid-body physics engines. Particle-based simulators have been developed to model the dynamics of these complex scenes; however, relying on approximation techniques, their simulation often deviates from real-world physics, especially in the long term. In this paper, we propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. We demonstrate robots achieving complex manipulation tasks using the learned simulator, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam, with experiments both in simulation and in the real world. Our study helps lay the foundation for robot learning of dynamic scenes with particle-based representations.", "keywords": ["Dynamics modeling", "Control", "Particle-Based Representation"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper proposes a particle based framework for learning object dynamics. A scene is represented by a hierarchical graph over particles, edges between particles are established dynamically based on Euclidean distance. The model is used for model predictive control, and there is also one experiment with a particle graph built from a real scene as opposed to simulation.\n\nAll reviewers agree that the architectural changes over previous relational networks  are worthwhile and merit publication. They also suggest to tone down the ``dynamic\u201d part of the graph construction by stating that edges are determined based on a radius. In particular, previous works also consider similar addition of edges during collisions, quoting Mrowca et al. \"Collisions between objects are handled by dynamically defining pairwise collision relations ... between leaf particles...\" which suggests that comparison against a baseline for Mrowca et al. that uses a static graph is not entirely fair. The authors are encouraged to repeat the experiment without disabling such dynamic addition of edges. \n\n"}, "review": {"ryehJ1s2n7": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rJgbSn09Ym", "review": "[Paper Summary]\nThis paper tackles the problem of learning dynamics of non-rigid objects in a physics simulator. This learned dynamics can then be used for planning later. The non-rigid objects are represented via a particle-based system. The dynamics model is learned using NVIDIA's particle-based simulator \"Flex\". The main idea is to adapt Interaction Networks [Battaglia, 2016] which was earlier proposed for rigid-body simulators to particle-based simulators. Instead of maintaining interactions at the level of objects as in [Battaglia, 2016], the proposed approach models interaction at the level of particles.\n\n[Paper Strengths]\nThe paper is clearly written and tackles an important research problem. The existing literature is presented well.\n\n[Paper Weaknesses]\n=> The introduction and the text in the first two pages seem to be introducing a new way to model \"dynamic\" interactions between particles for handling non-rigid transformations. However, upon reading the method section, the approach seems to be a direct application of the Interaction Graph Networks (originally applied to the rigid-body simulator) to the particle-based simulator. The only difference is that instead of maintaining a fully-connected graph (memory and computational bottleneck), each particle is only connected to the near-by particles within distance d.\n\n=> One of the major issue with the paper is the experimental section of the paper. Since the proposed method is quite incremental over the prior work, a strong empirical section is must to justify the approach. Here are the comments:\n   - Since the proposed approach is an adaptation of [Battaglia, 2016], it should be compared to other existing methods. The experiment section in its current state does not compare to any baseline. The well-written related work (section-2) talks about (Mrowca et.al. 2018) and (Schenck and Fox, 2018) as the works which investigate learning dynamics of deformable objects using a particle-based simulator. However, no comparison is provided to either of the methods. Hence, it is not possible to judge the quality of the presented results.\n\n   - All results in Figure-5 or Figure-3 are quite close to each other. It is not clear whether the improvement is significant or not since the error bars are not provided at all.\n\n   - No ablation is performed to test the sensitivity of the proposed method with respect to the hyper-parameters introduced; for instance, the distance 'd'.\n\n=> The name \"Dynamic Particle Interaction\" is overloaded with terms, especially, the use of word 'dynamic' here just refers to the interaction of particles to model deformable objects. This \"dynamic\" interaction is not \"learned\" but simply hard-coded by deleting the edges which are farther than d distance apart and adding near ones. Something like \"Particle-level Interaction Networks\" would be a more honest description of the approach.\n\n[Final Recommendation]\nI request the authors to address the comments raised above and will decide my final rating based on that.

This model applies a shared encoder to the particle states (positions and velocities), a shared relation network to nearby pairs, and a shared propagator network to the summed relation network outputs.  In some cases this process is applied in a multi-scale hierarchical fashion.  The authors demonstrate accurate rollouts of system dynamics and usefulness for manipulative control of deformable objects.\n\nI find the motivation in the introduction persuasive and the algorithmic approach sound.  I also like the application to RL.  However, I do have some concerns, as follows:\n\n1)  The novelty of the method is questionable.  Specifically, the hierarchical interaction network proposed here seems extremely similar to the prior (and cited) paper (Mrowca et al., 2018), which the authors do not directly compare against.  If there is a non-negligible difference between the two algorithms, then the authors should explicitly discuss the difference and empirically compare the two, in order to benefit others in the community who otherwise would not know which to use.\n\n2)  The paper would benefit a lot from a diagram of the model.  Specifically, it would be good to have a diagram of the hierarchical interaction network demonstrating the multiscale propagation.  This could go in Figure 1, perhaps replacing elements (b) and (d) of the current Figure 1, which in my opinion are unnecessary and can be removed.\n\n3)  The paper uses domain-specific hyperparameters, yet does not discuss or analyze the effects of these hyperparameters much.  Specifically, for this method to be useful to others, we would like to know how to choose (i) the propagation step L, (ii) the number of roots, and (iii) the neighborhood distance d.  In the paper, these numbers are chosen differently for the different environments without explanation.  Graphs showing performance on each task over a range of values of these parameters would be good (perhaps in the supplementary material).  Also, using the same hyperparameters for all environments (or at least a common generating function) would help support the generality of this model.\n\n4)  The treatment of rigid bodies seems a bit hand-held.  Specifically, to determine the dynamics of rigid bodies, there is a ground-truth calculation which calculates computes the velocity and angular velocity of the body from the model predictions for its constituent particles.  Furthermore, if I understand correctly, there is a different motion predictor network for those particles in a rigid body than those in the surrounding fluid --- is this correct?  If so, this raises the questions:  (i) What happens if the same motion-predictor network is used for all particles, and (ii) What happens if the ground-truth rigid dynamics calculation is not done, so the model has to do all the work?  It would be interesting to have these as baselines.\n\n5)  It would be nice to see more generalization results.  There is only one generalization experiment, testing for generalization over particle number in FluidShake.  However, the FluidShake model is not hierarchical.  The hierarchical models are a big emphasis in the paper, so showing generalization on BoxBath or RiceGrip would be much more meaningful.\n\n6)  No confidence intervals for the quantitative results.  Confidence intervals would be good to see in the table in Figure 3-a.  Also, the bar graph in Figure 5 really would benefit from errorbars --- it is difficult to determine if the results are significant.\n\n7)  While the text is generally clear and definitely understandable, I have a couple of comments about it:  (i) The last three paragraphs of the introduction are repetitive and I think they can be removed, or at least shortened a lot.  There are also quite a number of grammatical errors throughout the paper, though it is still comprehensible.\n\nEDIT:  In their revision the authors addressed these concerns well and the paper is much more convincing (see longer comment below).

In my opinion, the resulting particle interaction network would deserve publication for itself.

Our contributions and comparisons with baselines\nThanks for the suggestions. Our paper is novel, because it first explores learning particle dynamics among fluids and rigid bodies, with a dynamically-built graph, and because it first applies the learned particle dynamics model for control, in both synthetic environments and on a real robot. Here, we summarize the three key differences between our paper and earlier works that serve as our inspiration [1, 2]: \n\n1) We learn dynamics between particles that are in different physical states (e.g. between rigid bodies and fluids), while other works focused on scenarios where all objects are in the same state, e.g. all soft or rigid bodies (Mrowca et al. [1]), or all fluids (Schenck and Fox [2]). \n2) While Mrowca et al. used a static graph, our model uses an interaction graph built dynamically. Since maintaining a dynamic graph is crucial for simulating objects undergoing large deformation like fluids, this modification has enabled our model to work better in the more challenging cases mentioned above.\n3) We have applied our model to more challenging control problems, including one on a real-world robot. In the other paper (Mrowca et al. [1]), however, this non-trivial task was not explored at all. Demonstrating the power of learned particle dynamics models on downstream control tasks is an important contribution to the learning and robotics community. It should not be undervalued.\n\nOur dynamics model includes many improvements compared with the vanilla interaction networks: the use of dynamic graphs, multi-step propagations, and the hierarchical structure. While the hierarchical structure and multi-step propagations have been explored (Mrowca et al and Li et al), dynamically-built interaction graphs are new, the combination of these ideas is new, and most importantly, applying them to control is new. \n\nIn particular, a dynamically-built graph can better capture the inductive bias for many common physical systems like fluids and gases, as well as extrapolations to unseen environments (Fig. 3). We agree with the reviewer that learning to build dynamic graphs is definitely an important future direction, which we\u2019re currently pursuing, but we\u2019d also like to emphasize that the idea of updating the interaction graph based on the states of the particles is conceptually important and empirically useful.\n\nWe agree that it\u2019ll be important to clearly discuss the differences and include additional comparisons.

Ablation studies\nWe\u2019ll add confidence intervals and error bars to Fig. 3 and 5. The improvements of the simulation results in Fig. 3 are significant: on average, the rollout loss decreases by 85% with the use of dynamic graphs. We will also add more comparisons with related works demonstrating the effectiveness of our introduced techniques.\n\nThe hyperparameters used in the paper are not specific to environments. The supplementary material shows that most hyperparameters are kept the same across scenarios.

We use state-specific models because there are only a few states of interest (solids, liquids, and soft bodies), and their physical behaviors are drastically different. We agree with the reviewer that additional comparisons are important: we\u2019ll add experiments with a unified dynamics model.\n\nThe motion of a rigid body only has six degrees of freedom. Predicting per-particle movement does not work well, compared with predicting a global rigid motion, because particles will deform and scatter. We will also add a comparison to the revision.\n\n4.
