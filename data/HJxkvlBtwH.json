Below we answer the concerns:\n\n\nQ1: Can you provide background on neural network certification?\n\nA1: Certification of neural networks is an emerging area which aims to prove the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. For an introduction to the area, we refer the reviewer to related work listed in the introduction, particularly [1] which provides a unifying framework for many of the existing approaches. You can also check the answer we provide to Reviewer 2 for more technical details.\n\nCertification of neural networks is still at an early stage and none of the existing approaches scales to state-of-the-art networks and datasets (e.g. ImageNet). While here we do not directly consider the state-of-the-art architectures you listed, our method for certifying recurrent networks is general and can be applied to those architectures as well. However, certification methods for computer vision tasks have scaled from verifying small networks with 200 neurons to large residual networks with thousands of neurons and we expect the same progress in the audio domain in the future.\n\nOur work is the first one to certify audio classifiers. None of the existing approaches can handle this task and are mostly limited to computer vision. The only alternative approach which can handle recurrent networks, POPQORN, does not scale to the audio benchmarks as we demonstrated in our experiments in Appendix E.\n\n\nQ2: Section 2.

In the meantime, here we provide short summary: \n\nMost existing state-of-the-art scalable certification methods aim to capture all possible behaviors of a neural network using convex relaxations. In this perspective, we treat the input with the predefined perturbation range as a multi-dimensional polyhedron and pass it through the operations within the network.\nThe most basic approach here uses interval propagation - it maintains the minimum and maximum possible value for each neuron in the network. More recent work (listed in Section 2) presents more elaborate relaxations to capture the propagation of the initial perturbation through the network.\nRobustness certification is performed by checking whether the neuron corresponding to the true label is always greater than neurons corresponding to other labels with respect to the input region. If this is true, then we can establish the network correctly classifies the input under all possible realized perturbations. We will further elaborate on this in the next revision.\n \n\nQ2: The so-called audio processing pipeline here is actually speech processing pipeline.

Below we answer the concerns:\n\nQ1: While I found section 3 to be useful to get an intuition of the proposed method, I still feel that it could be condensed a bit to add in additional details. For example, the authors don\u2019t describe \u201cback-substitution\u201d in the work, which I believe should be described in the main text.\n\nA1: We added more details on back-substitution in the last paragraph of Section 3. We have not described back-substitution in full detail in the main text as it is not part of our main contributions. Full details of this algorithm can be found in [1]. We also provide full derivation of bounds in our overview example using back-substitution in Appendix C. \n\n\nQ2: How sensitive was the provability metric to the choice of these 100 test examples?\n\nA2: To check the sensitivity of our results to the choice of 100 samples that we verified we ran the verification on 10 random permutations of our test set (each time with a different seed). We describe this experiment in Appendix F and show the verification results in Figure 9 with error bars indicating the variance. These results show that provability is not significantly affected by the choice of 100 element subset used for verification. In the next revision, we will include these error bars for each plot.\n\n\nQ3: The section on \u201cProvable defense for audio classifiers\u201d was not very clear to me. The authors state that \u201cTo train, we combine standard loss with the worst case loss obtained using interval propagation.\u201d I was not clear on what the modified loss is. Could the authors please clarify this in the text, preferably a mathematical formulation? Also, I\u2019m curious why these experiments are only conducted on the FSDD set, but not on the GSC set. \n\nA3: In Appendix G we have now provided the detailed description of our provable defense procedure, including a mathematical formulation of a modified loss, which closely follows Gowal et al. (2018). We also ran this experiment for GSC network \u2014  these results are also presented in Appendix G.\n\n\nQ4: Why does the interval analysis technique perform so much worse on the GSC set relative to the FSDD set? Could you describe more details about the model architectures used for the two tasks?\n\nA4: Based on our experiments, we believe that certifying GSC is more difficult for two reasons: (i) the main factor which impacts provability is the number of frames \u2014 each additional frame causes accumulation of errors introduced by loose convex relaxations which ultimately makes the certification more likely to fail. This reflects in the fact that GSC, where samples have 19 frames on average, is significantly more difficult to certify than FSDD which has samples with 15 frames on average, and (ii) given that GSC and FSDD have 30 and 10 output classes, respectively, in the case of GSC verifier needs to prove that the final logit of correct class is greater than the logit of all other 29 classes which is naturally more difficult than proving it for only 9 other classes as is the case with FSDD.  \n\n\nQ5: Could you quantify and report the difference in the volume between POPQORN and your approach? Also, why are the approximation volumes not comparable between the two systems? \n\nA5: Please see our answer to the main points above where we provide answers to these questions and in-depth comparison between POPQORN and our approach.\n\n\nQ6: Could you clarify that there is significant body of work which operates directly on the time domain signal?\n\nA6: Yes, thank you for the helpful references.

We first answer the main points, followed by specific questions:\n\n - Comparison with POPQORN:\n\n  We provide detailed quantitative comparison between our approach and POPQORN in Appendix E. The main takeaways are:\n\n  1) Our method produces bounds strictly better than interval bounds (see Theorem 1). This means the maximum distance between the true function and our bounds cannot grow arbitrarily large. POPQORN offers no such guarantees. Although POPQORN uses gradient descent to optimize for the bounds with minimum volume, there are no convergence or optimality guarantees. This can cause imprecise results in practice \u2014 we found many inputs in our audio benchmarks for which POPQORN produces bounds worse than intervals, please see Figure 6 in Appendix E for one example. Our bounds are strictly better than intervals and do not suffer from this problem.\n\n  2) While we experimented with POPQORN on synthetic inputs and found that it indeed produces relaxations with slightly smaller volume than our method, for realistic inputs which appear in our audio benchmarks it often performs worse. As it is non-comparable to intervals, meaning that all points obtained via intervals are not included inside those obtained via POPQORN and vice-versa, its bounds are often worse than intervals, e.g. see Figure 6.\n\n  3) As POPQORN is relatively slow (108 minutes per sample), we evaluated it only on 10 samples. We plugged their relaxation of tanh * sigmoid instead of our bounds and demonstrated that it results in 0 verified samples on our benchmarks. At the same time, we verify 4 out of these 10 samples (in 29 seconds per sample). We believe the core reason is the existence of many pathological cases as described in the previous point where gradient descent used by POPQORN converges to suboptimal solution which ends up being worse than interval bounds. We note that we contacted the authors to confirm that we are using their framework correctly.\n\n  4) POPQORN is 100 - 1000 times slower than DAC as it relies on optimization via gradient descent whereas DAC produces bounds in constant time. This makes POPQORN less practical for verification at the scale of audio classifiers.\n\n\n - Speedup of the existing implementation:\n\n  We optimized our implementation which improved the runtime of back-substitution. This results in a significant speedup of end-to-end verification: for update depth of 3 now it takes 17.74 seconds per input, compared to 87.92 seconds reported in Table 2. For larger back-substitution depths, the speedup is even larger. We will update running time analysis for experiments in Table 2.\n", "title": "Main Points for Common Concerns"}, "S1lGzu0hYH": {"type": "review", "replyto": "HJxkvlBtwH", "review": "This paper proposes an approach for the certification of speech classification neural networks against adversarial perturbations. The network is based on a simple pipeline starting from MFCC to make an utterance level classifier via a last hidden state of an LSTM acoustic model. This approach can perform analysis through this pipeline. I feel that this paper is very difficult to follow because of the lack of background technique explanations based on neural network certification, and the lack of technical surveys of speech recognition and related areas. This paper requires such major restructuring and more surveys to make it in good shape.\n\nComments\n- The authors only list CTC related techniques as state-of-the-art ASR, but state-of-the-art ASR is still based on the HMM/DNN hybrid system or attention-based encoder-decoder/RNN transducer. They seriously lack the surveys o this area. Also several technical terminologies are not common in the speech recognition are (e.g., automated speech recognition --> automatic speech recognition)\n- \"Additionally, audio systems typically use recurrent architectures (Chiu et al., 2017)\": There are a lot of state-of-the-art ASR systems including TDNN (Kaldi), CNN, and transformer.

We report the number of provably correct samples out of these 100 as our provability.\u201d How sensitive was the provability metric to the choice of these 100 test examples? Was the metric computed by repeatedly sampling 100 test cases, for example?\n3. The section on \u201cProvable defense for audio classifiers\u201d was not very clear to me.

Also, why are the approximation volumes not comparable between the two systems. \n\nMinor comment: It is true that most works in audio classification and speech recognition use processed frontend features such as MFCCs. However, there is also a significant body of work which operates directly on the time-domain signal.
