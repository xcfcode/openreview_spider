While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by  placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.\n", "keywords": ["Evidential deep learning", "Uncertainty estimation", "Epistemic uncertainty"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper presents a method for providing uncertainty for deep learning regressors through assigning a notion of evidence to the predictions.

The main idea follows the evidential deep learning work proposed in (Sensoy et al., 2018) extending it from the classification regime to the regression regime, by placing evidential priors over the Gaussian likelihood function and performing the type-II maximum likelihood estimation similar to the empirical Bayes method [1,2]. The authors demonstrated that the both the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties could be estimated in one forward pass under the proposed framework without resorting to multiple passes and showed favorable uncertainty comparing to existing methods. Robustness against out of distribution and adversarially perturbed data is illustrated as well.\n\nOn the technical side, the novelty is incremental. The extension from the classification regime to the regression regime, from the conjugate Dirichet prior to the conjugate Normal-Inverse-Gamma prior, is quite straightforward. Besides, the presentation of the paper could be largely improved. It is not easy to follow the derivation in Section 3. The discussion of concepts and problem definitions look fragmented and incoherent. Even though the presentation largely follows (Sensoy et al., 2018) and uses terms from theory of evidence, the derivation actually is more aligned with the prior network [3] under the Bayesian framework which is missing from the references. It is really confusing that the authors talked about the variational inference when conjugate prior is used, and it is unclear how the variational distributions are used in Section 3.2 or how the \"I don't know\" loss term relates to the KL-divergence between the variational distribution and the prior in Section 3.3. This term was manually added as additional regularization to \"prefer the evidence to shrink to zero for a sample if it cannot be correctly classified\" in (Sensoy et al., 2018), and a different regularization was used to encourage distributional uncertainty in [3]. I hope that the authors could spend more efforts clarifying their ideas, especially the derivations in Section 3.2 and 3.3.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no referring to the input x in the entire derivation and problem formulation in Section 3. It took me a while to realize that the formulation in (4) actually defines the generation for a particular input, not for all the inputs. That is, the model is trying to model heteroscedastic uncertainty, not the homoscedastic counterpart. It could be better to call out the dependence on the input explicitly. \n\nOn the quantitative side, the baseline models considered in Section 4 are mainly concerned with epistemic uncertainty estimation. So it would be good to explicitly discuss which uncertainty estimation was compared with. This work estimates both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, so a better comparison is to models that estimate both quantities (Kendall & Gal, 2017)[4] which has been shown to give better output estimation comparing to epistemic uncertainty estimation only (Kendall & Gal, 2017).\n\nOther comments:\n- What is the \\pi in equation (8)?\n- The \"I don't know\" loss introduced in Section 3.3 used L-p norm. What is the originality of the L-p norm here? In practice, which p value should be used? In the experiments, which p value was used?\n- The RMSE results of the depth estimation presented in Table 2 are orders of magnitude smaller than those from existing work, for example Table 2(b) in (Kendall & Gal, 2017). Was a different RMSE computation used in this work?\n- From the caption in Table 2, it seems that only 5 samples were used in MC-dropout, which is considerably smaller than those used in existing work (Kendall & Gal, 2017).\n\n[1] D.J.C.

Note that on Eq. 21 the inner integral over the data, y, has been evaluated to allow for a more direct comparison to NLL. We would like to draw attention to the fact that these two equations follow the same form of: \n\n\\int_\\theta  [ X * p(theta|m) ]  d\\theta\n\nwhere X is the only difference between the two equations. In the NLL case, X, this is simply p(y|theta), which naturally is the likelihood function of the data. However, in the SOS case, X interestingly becomes: \n\n(y - mu)^2 + sigma^2\n\nWhich places an L2 penalty on the data (from the mean), while also trying to drive the aleatoric uncertainty (sigma) to zero. Therefore, the SOS X loss term shown here is optimizing directly on the error of the parameters whereas the NLL X term is trying to maximize the likelihood of the data given the distribution. We hope this explicit term helps bring light to the modelling difference between our two losses, please let us know if there is anything else we can clarify on this front. \n\nWe would like to now turn to your second question on our new OOD example experiment. For a general comment reader, the Figure we will be discussing is Fig. 6. You are certainly correct that epistemic uncertainty increases also on the in-distribution samples we show. In fact, this was exactly what we were trying to demonstrate by sorting the images by uncertainty from left-to-right. We recognize that even when in-distribution there are certain samples which are clearly harder than others and can lead to a greater chance of error. The same can be said for our out-of-distribution examples (i.e. the dog is far more out-of-distribution than the rubble ground). We focus on in-distribution test samples in this response as the reviewer\u2019s question is directly asking about those. Looking at the columns from left-to-right in this figure we can observe that: \n\n- column 1: is relatively straightforward, a large part of the image is a well-illuminated ground plane, the corners and edges of nearly all objects are clearly shown\n- column 2: more challenging than column 1, very poor illumination which can certainly cause an increase in epistemic uncertainty; \n- column 3: might seem simple at first, however there is a large unknown object placed on the far right edge of the image that is very difficult to gain a depth understanding of because on a small portion is shown. The lamp is also fairly infrequently seen in our dataset causing some added uncertainty; \n- column 4: presents many small objects scattered on top of the kitchen counter, each of these objects is very hard to accurately see and infer depth from; \n- column 5: the most challenging in-distribution example that we see. There are many challenges we see with this example, the most obvious being the giant mirror that takes up a significant part of the image. Mirrors are very challenging from both the epistemic and aleatoric point of view (as we show in Fig. 5). Like previous columns there are also many smaller objects that could be attributed to the increase in epistemic uncertainty. \n\nTo directly answer your question, yes we did observe that the uncertainty of in-distribution test images varied; however, we would characterize the changes as generally smooth with very heavy tails which we do not visualize here (in general there were no large jumps outside of the tails). The jump between the first and second column is potentially entering the lower tail region, but we felt it was important to visualize for the reader at least one example where the uncertainty is lower than the remainder of the in-distribution images and with clear semantic reason (well-lit area, image of standard objects, etc).  On the other hand, the change between in-distribution and OOD was not nearly as smooth. There was a clear jump between the most certain OOD example and the most uncertain in-distribution example like the reviewer mentions. The gravel example presents many similarities to our dataset as it contains a main ground plane and depth increases into the horizon; however, we see there is still a large jump between this example and our in-distribution samples. \n", "title": "SOS vs NLL and uncertainty increases "}, "HklTztaioB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "S1eSoeSYwr", "comment": "We would like to thank all reviewers for their very thoughtful feedback on our work.

We completely agree with your assessment that our work follows the Prior Network framework naturally and have updated Sec. 3 in our latest revision to take this into account. Please also refer to our latest comment to all reviewers for a summary of these changes. \n\nRegarding the unavailability of ground truth likelihood data in regression problems, we hope to address your question here (as well as in the now revised Sec. 3). If you refer to the related work on evidential priors for classification [1, 2] the uncertainty is inflated by minimizing the KL between a modified version of the inferred distribution and an uncertainty prior distribution. However, the point we would like to draw attention to is how the inferred distribution is modified. In both approaches, the authors require the ground truth likelihood of the target to redistribute the density of the posterior before minimizing the KL. This way, evidence is reduced only on the classes which the sample was not part of. In classification, the ground truth labels are samples of the categorical likelihood, so we know the full and bounded set of classes that should lower their evidence. \n\n[side note] In [1] this requirement is described on page 6, and the modified distribution parameters are denoted as \\tilde{\\alpha}_i. In [2], this requirement is described on page 6, Eq. 12 and 13. \n\nIn the regression setting, this optimization algorithm would require knowledge of the ground truth likelihood (\\mu, \\sigma) from which the datapoint, y, was sampled. This is because we cannot reduce evidence everywhere except our single point estimate as this space is infinite and unbounded. One alternative could be to leverage the estimated likelihood (which we can obtain from the NIG) to use instead. However, we found that doing so does not work in practice (validated in both our regression setting as well as the prior works classification setting). \n\nTherefore, to overcome this limitation, we believe one of our main contributions was a novel loss function for expressing uncertainty on mistakes that can be applied to the regression setting. We hope that this explanation as well as the added revision to Sec 3 (specifically 3.2.2) helps clarify our the novelty of our optimization method. \n\n[1] M.

Regarding the KL uncertainty loss term, we are actively working to strengthen the text and describe how our formulation relates to the original ELBO formulation as they both aim to inflate uncertainty of the posterior. The reviewers suggestions on this are extremely helpful and will be included in the next revision. Our uncertainty inflation loss function also presents a key contribution of this work compared to related works in the classification domain. While in classification, there is a ground truth (and known) likelihood distribution for every sample, in regression the underlying likelihood distribution is not known a priori, thereby motivating our loss function. \n\nOther comments: \n1. We have added additional clarification in the text. A higher order distribution is one which, when sampled from, yields a distribution over the data. For example, sampling from a Normal Inverse-Gamma distribution yields the parameters (mean, variance) of a Gaussian distribution over the data. Another interpretation stems from conjugate priors in Bayesian probability theory. For instance, the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the categorical distribution, which is more in line with the interpretation taken in [1].\n\n2. Thank you, we\u2019ve corrected this. \n\n3. The assumption that the posterior can be factorized over the model parameters follows directly from the mean-field approximation [2] used in mean-field variational Bayes which factorizes over the the model\u2019s latent variables. In the context of evidential distributions, the latent variables are exactly the parameters defining the lower-order distribution (in this case a Gaussian with mean, \\mu, and variance, \\sigma^2). \n\n4. Excellent question. L_NLL approaches the optimization problem from the lens of an empirical Bayes formulation, where the objective is to *maximize* model evidence, p(y|m).

We would like to clarify several points on novelty and our contribution. While prior works in the classification domain require a ground truth likelihood function over the data, our work, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first demonstration of how epistemic uncertainty can be learned without this information. Thus, our approach enables application to the wider range of regression problems (e.g., depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc) which directly map data to targets without a known likelihood function.\n\nSpecifically, while the use of a N.I.G. prior is an expected extension from the Dirichlet prior used in the classification regime, there are several challenges in inflating the model\u2019s prior epistemic uncertainty that are specific to regression learning problems. Namely: \n\n1. To effectively model epistemic uncertainty a regularization loss is needed to minimize divergence to an \u201cuncertain\u201d distribution. In classification [1, 2], this is somewhat trivial and is done by minimizing the KL-divergence from the inferred posterior to a uniform Dirichlet. In the regression domain, a uniform prior is not well defined. A simple univariate example to demonstrate this is that the KL-divergence between any inferred Gaussian and a Gaussian with infinitely large variance is always infinite, regardless of the inferred Gaussian. Therefore, simply inflating uncertainty by minimizing a direct KL loss will not achieve the desired results in regression. \n\n2. Furthermore both [1, 2] require the inferred distribution to be redistributed and remove the non-misleading evidence. This requires a priori knowledge of the ground truth likelihood function of the data. In classification this is straightforward as the data labels are typically provided as one-hot encodings which directly represents the likelihood function. In regression problems, there unfortunately is no analog as labels directly represent the target with no likelihood association. Our work contributes a solution to handle such regression problems despite classical evidential optimization techniques not being applicable. Furthermore, we acknowledge that inflating the regression uncertainties still presents many open research questions, in addition to the solution presented in this paper.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental learning approaches from the classification domain [1, 2], even after adapting to the context of a N.I.G. prior, are not applicable to regression, thus necessitating the approach presented in this work. We are actively working to improve the exposition of these ideas as well as the introduction and motivation of the \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d loss term in our next revision of Sec. 3. \n\nWe would like to especially thank the reviewer for comments on lack of comparisons to aleatoric uncertainty estimation (in addition to epistemic). As a result, we have conducted numerous additional experiments on synthetic datasets (with known aleatoric uncertainty) as well as on depth dataset. We present our results for both of these experiments and compared to other methods (i.e. [3]) in Figures 5 and 8.  \n\nOther comments: \n1. \\pi = 3.1415. \\Gamma(.) = Gamma function [4]. \n\n2. We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this point of confusion in our formulation. We have clarified the choice of p in the text (please refer to pg. 5)\n\n3. Thank you for raising this point. The output label in our context was the inverse depth (i.e. scaled disparity) which caused the relative differences in error. It is often preferred [5, 6, 7], from an optimization point of view, to predict disparity as opposed to depth as it is more numerically stable (far objects, such as the sky, have an extremely large depth but disparity of zero). \n\n4. We use a higher number of samples in the accuracy experiments presented in Table 1. On the other hand, Table 2 aimed to compare compute efficiency (not accuracy), so to give sampling techniques an added benefit, we report runtime and memory requirements on a smaller number of samples. We have also added experiments (Table 3) with greater number of samples to address the reviewer\u2019s suggestion.  \n\n[1] M.
