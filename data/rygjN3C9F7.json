A variational upper bound allows us to implement this method efficiently. The bound itself is bounded above by the variational information bottleneck objective, and the two methods coincide in the regime of single-shot Monte Carlo approximations. The notion of deficiency provides a principled way of approximating complicated channels by relatively simpler ones. The deficiency of one channel w.r.t. another has an operational interpretation in terms of the optimal risk gap of decision problems, capturing classification as a special case. Unsupervised generalizations are possible, such as the deficiency autoencoder, which can also be formulated in a variational form. Experiments demonstrate that the deficiency bottleneck can provide advantages in terms of minimal sufficiency as measured by information bottleneck curves, while retaining a good test performance in classification and reconstruction tasks.

It also has a simple computational formula.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe experiments are minimal proofs of concept on MNIST and fashion MNIST, and the authors didn't find an example where this formulation makes a large difference.  The resulting formula is very close to existing methods.  Finally the paper is a bit dense and the intuitions we should gain from this theory aren't made clear.\n\nPoints of contention:\nOne reviewer pointed out the close connection of the new objective to IWAE, and the authors added a discussion of the relation and showed that they're not mathematically equivalent.  However, as far as I can tell they're almost identical in purpose:  As k -> \\infty in IWAE, the encoder ceases to matter.  And as M -> \\infty in VDB, we take the max over all encoders.  Could the method proposed in this paper lead to an alternative to IWAE in the VAE setting?\n\nConsensus:\nConsensus wasn't reached, but the \"7\" reviewer did not appear to have put much though into their review."}, "review": {"SkeI70MiAm": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Byx7lzhRhQ", "comment": "Thank you for your comments! \n\n* We included a table showing accuracy numbers for different values of beta and M (see p. 6, Table 1) for the latent bottleneck sizes K=256 (Figure 2) and K=2 (Figure 3). \n\n* In relation to the figures, we have improved these in the revision. We are added a figure tracing the mutual information between representation and output I(Z;Y) vs. the minimality term I(Z;X) for different values of beta (see Figure 2, lower right panel), when training with our loss function. This is the usual information bottleneck curve. This contrasts with the deficiency bottleneck curve (Figure 2, upper right panel) which traces the corresponding sufficiency term J(Z;Y) (which is just the entropy of the labels minus our loss) vs. I(Z;X) for different values of beta. Note that for M=1, J(Z;Y) = I(Z;Y). We apologize for the confusion. The text now makes this more explicit (see p.7, first paragraph).\n\n* In response to your question about how we estimate the mutual information. Yes, we minimize an upper bound on both the deficiency and the rate term (see p.3, equation 3 and discussion leading up to the VDB objective in equation 4). The estimation of this upper bound is simplified by our choice of the prior and the encoding distribution which are diagonal Gaussians. The KL term can be computed and differentiated without estimation. We estimate the expected loss term using Monte Carlo sampling. We draw samples from the encoder using the reparameterization trick and leverage automatic differentiation (in Tensorflow) to compute the gradients. Since the expectation is inside the log, gradient updates may have higher variance for larger values of M. \n\nOur model is a classifier and our loss term is a tighter bound on the misclassification error (bias) than the usual cross-entropy loss as in the VIB (see p. 12, equation 13). Trading bias for variance has been investigated in some recent works (see, e.g., Bamler, Robert, et al. \"Perturbative black box variational inference.\" NIPS 2017). See last paragraph in p. 18 for the related discussion in the unsupervised setting.\n\n* In relation to the connection to IWAE, we have included a detailed discussion in Appendix E.1. \n\nThe method is different from ours, except in the limiting case where M = 1 and beta =1, in which case it coincides with the beta-VAE and also with our method. After taking a close look, we make the following observations: \n\nFor M > 1, the IWAE bound does not admit a decomposition like the standard ELBO (see equation 29 and 36) into a reconstruction loss term and a regularization term. In particular, this implies we cannot trade-off reconstruction fidelity for learning more meaningful representations by incorporating bottleneck constraints. See ensuing discussion in p.18 following equation 36. \nIn contrast, our method has a tuning parameter beta. \n\nThe IWAE bound is known to be equivalent to the ELBO in expectation with a more complex approximate posterior qIW (see p.17, equation 34 and 35 and references therein in Appendix E.1). For beta values other than 1, a naive trick would be to plant qIW in liue of qphi in equation 37 (p. 18) to get a beta-IWAE of sorts. It is not entirely clear however, why we would want to do so when modulating beta already suffices to tune the VAE towards autoencoding (low beta) or autodecoding behavior (high beta) depending on the requirement at hand. A similar argument goes in the direction of an \"Importance weighted Variational Information Bottleneck\". We have not explored if and how using more expressive posteriors such as the qIW (p. 17, equation 35) can help the supervised bottleneck formulations in VDB or VIB. This remains a scope for future study. \n\nWe are now also citing the paper Yuri Burda, Roger Grosse, Ruslan Salakhutdinov. Importance Weighted Autoencoders.

In the paper's variational deficiency setting, although plotting I(Z;Y) vs I(Z;X) is necessary, it would be also helpful for the authors' to plot Deficiency vs I(Z;X), because this is what new objective is trading-off. \n- Again, Figure 3, it is hard to see the benefits for increasing M from the visualizations for different clusterings. \n- How do the paper estimate I(Z;Y) and I(Z;X) for plotting these figures?
