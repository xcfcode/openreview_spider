We call them textual relational problems. A popular model for textual relational problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors and use composition functions (e.g. difference or concatenation) of those vectors as features for the prediction. Meanwhile, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this work, we show that textual relational models implicitly use compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference).  We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.", "keywords": ["Statistical Relational Learning", "Sentence Embedding", "Composition functions", "Natural Language Inference", "InferSent", "SentEval", "ComplEx"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper offers a new angle through which to study the development of comparison functions for sentence pair classification tasks by drawing on the literature on statistical relational learning. All three reviewers seemed happy to see an attempt to unify these two closely related relation-learning problems. However, none of the reviewers were fully convinced that this attempt has yielded any substantial new knowledge: Many of the ideas that come out of this synthesis have already appeared in the sentence-pair modeling literature (in work cited in the paper under review), and the proposed new methods do not yield substantial improvements for the tasks they're tested on.\n\nI'm happy to accept the authors' arguments that sentence-to-vector models have practical value, and I'm not placing too much weight on the reviewer's comments about the choice to use that modeling framework. I am slightly concerned that the reviewers (especially R2) observed some overly broad statements in the paper, and I urge the authors to take those comments very seriously.\n\nI'm mostly concerned, though, about the lack of an impactful positive contribution: I'd have hoped for a paper of this kind to offer a  a method with clear empirical advantages over prior work, or else a formal result which is more clearly new, and the reviewers are not convinced that this paper makes a contribution of either kind.\n"}, "review": {"HyeT7CTY2Q": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkxZFoAqtQ", "review": "This work proposes a view on tasks requiring pairs of sentence representations from the perspective of statistical relational learning (SRL), where there exist a multitude of composition functions for pairs of entity vectors.

The main idea is to develop compositions for language models based on SRL methods that learn relationships between entities such as ReSCAL and IETrans.\n\nCompositions based on deep semantic meaning in language is a significant problem. The proposed ideas seem to be quite general for NLP compositions. However, some of the listed contributions were not so clear to me. For example, in section 2, it seems like the results were already known that some of the compositions are weak (or maybe the way it is written needs to be changed a little). Regarding the novelty, w.r.t the compositions, it does use existing SRL work but in a different context of NLP problems, this makes novelty a bit weak.\n\nRegarding the experiments, several NLP datasets are used for evaluation across 2 tasks, showing that the method can generalize well.  However, the improvement over existing methods is marginal. Are there tradeoffs w.r.t training time etc. since the compositions are more complex? There is a sentence about it but a little vague.

In particular the paper argues that composition functions used in recent SRL techniques developed for entity-to-entity relationship detection can be applied to sentence-level relation prediction tasks. \n\nSuppose there is a prediction training task defined over pairs of sentences (x1, x2). This task requires some function 'f' that composes the sentence representations h1 and h2 into a single representation which is then used to \nmake the relation prediction i.e., we have a model g(f(h1, h2)) that is used to predict some relation between R(x1, x2).  This paper aims to show that with a better 'f' we can hope for a better result in transfer tasks (in addition to doing better on the training task). \n\nThe paper argues that this setting, at a high level, is similar to the composition function used in entity-entity relation prediction. There have been many such methods in the recent past (e.g., TransE, ComplEx, RESCAL). This paper asks whether these composition functions can work well for sentence-level tasks.\n\nThe paper then presents experiments which compare the performance of different composition functions against a basic composition function used in InferSent.\n\nStrengths of the paper:\n\n1. I like the main question of what can we learn from SRL. This seeks to bridge some independent research threads.\n2. The evaluation considers a range of composition functions used in SRL and applies them to the sentence tasks. \n3. Points out that some of the composition functions used in existing models are not particularly strong.\n\nIssues:\n\nI like the starting point for this paper very much and agree that the existing composition functions for sentence relations are rather weak. However, I am struggling to see if there is (i) a convincing conceptual argument for why SRL view of compositions is necessarily the answer for sentence level tasks, or (ii) a convincing empirical case for the same.  Some details on these points:\n\n1) The parallels between entity-entity relations and sentence-sentence relations seems a bit of a stretch to me. There is always some level of abstraction at which two problems might look similar, which can be advantageous for repurposing solutions. However, in this case I think the SRL view of the world hides the complexities in sentence-sentence relation tasks (e.g. aligning relevant pieces of information, requiring more complex composition functions to derive meaning etc.). \n\n2) I am not sure what knowledge we are getting from an SRL view of the problem that is not already known already to the communities that work on sentence embedding. The minimum requirements laid out can be met easily by existing methods for sentence representations. For instance that we need to allow for asymmetric relations (entailment order) is very well known. As the authors themselves point out there are solutions for this problem.  \n\n3) The empirical results don't appear convincing. The average gain for any particular method over InferSent is 0.3 in macro average. There is no single SRL based composition method that works consistently clear gains across most tasks. \n\nHere are some suggestions that I think will improve the paper (or at least help me buy the motivation): \n\n1. One question that might be useful to make a conceptual argument is how much work should be done in 'f' and should it change for the different type of target tasks.\n\nIf the idea is to transfer h for single sentence target task, then a powerful 'f' can render h1 and h2 to be simple enough, such that bulk of the work in extracting task related information might be done by 'f' itself. Therefore, transferred h may not be as powerful as it could have been with a less powerful 'f'.\n\nIf the idea is to transfer f(h1, h2) for sentence-pair target tasks, then a powerful 'f' might be a good thing. \n\n2) Another useful discussion would be to discuss why more powerful alignment based sentence representations are not being considered at least for comparison purposes. \n\nThe paper wants to go from a simple 'f' (i.e. concat(h1,h2), h1-h2) to some other choices for 'f' that are known functions from SRL. \n\nThere are several sentence-level representation functions such as ESIM [Chen et al., 2016] which uses a combined representation of premise and hypothesis sentences using soft alignment to specifically address the issues in comparing sentences. A similar representation is computed in BiDAF [Seo et al., 2017] in the context of matching question representation with sentence representations. \n\nTo summarize, I really like the basic starting point for the paper and would love to see a more compelling presentation of the conceptual argument and a stronger empirical comparison.\n", "title": "What does the SRL lens contribute?", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}}}
