This paper proposes controllable and interpretable high-resolution and fast face completion by learning generative adversarial networks (GANs) progressively from low resolution to high resolution. We present structure-aware and frequency-oriented attentive GANs. The proposed structure-aware component leverages off-the-shelf facial landmark detectors and proposes a simple yet effective  method of integrating the detected landmarks in generative learning. It facilitates facial expression transfer together with facial attributes control, and helps regularize the structural consistency in progressive training. The proposed  frequency-oriented attentive module (FOAM) encourages GANs to attend to only finer details in the coarse-to-fine progressive training, thus enabling progressive attention to face structures. The learned FOAMs show a strong pattern of switching its attention from low-frequency to high-frequency signals. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the CelebA-HQ benchmark. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art face completion methods. The proposed method is also fast with mean inference time of 0.54 seconds for images at 1024x1024 resolution (using a Titan Xp GPU).", "keywords": ["Face Completion", "GANs", "Conditional Image Synthesis", "Interpretability", "Frequency-Oriented Attention"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This work performs fast controllable and interpretable face completion, by proposing a progressive GAN with frequency-oriented attention modules (FOAM).

Are facial landmarks only for controlling facial expressions?\nYes, we have tried this. It performed worse on face completion tasks without the facial landmarks, especially when the masks were irregular (e.g. second and third images in Figure 6). The predicted facial landmarks (in our current pipeline) provide high level presentations of face structures, which helps the generation process, and enable the control of facial expressions.\n\nQ2:  As I carefully looked at the generated faces, many of them have asymmetric (unbalanced) eyes. Is it due to the predicted facial landmarks?\nThat is right, because the generation process is conditioned on these predicted landmarks. In this work, we have not specifically dealt with the symmetric issue. It will be an interesting topic  for future work, e.g., by introducing a symmetry-induced loss function and/or leveraging more powerful off-the-shelf facial landmark detectors. \n\nQ3: Is there any randomness (random input) involved during completion (generation)? Is this model possible to generate different faces from the same conditional input? &  What happens if the attributes are interpolated rather than zero or one?\nFor the model in this paper, there is no randomness involved. But we made a video demo (not included in this submission) to show the synthesized faces from interpolated attributes (some snapshots of the demo video is added as Figure 15 in the appendix). All of the faces are very natural, and the transitions between attributes (e.g. from smile to not smile, from male to female) are very smooth. It means this model is able to produce a variety of images. The results of soft attribute control will be added into result figures. Randomness can be achieved by attaching a random noise vector to the attribute vector.\n\nQ4: The order of Fig 4 and 5 seems weird.\nWe fixed the layout issue in the revision. \n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #1"}, "H1x7gVU3sB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HyxSxA-Rtr", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the comments and appreciation, and would like to answer the reviewer\u2019s concerns as follows:\n\nQ1:  The novelty, however, is not strong as the simple summation provides reasonable performance as convinced in the progressive growing GAN paper.

Therefore, the contributions of each component are not convincing.\nWe would like to point out that the convincing performance by the simple summation in PGGAN is for general unconditional image synthesis, not necessarily  transferrable to the face completion problem. Our ablation study qualitatively supports the necessity of the proposed FOAM, as well as our intuitive analyses after Eqn.3 (page 4). That being said, we agree that it will be better to do a quantitative study in addition to Figure 4.  One challenge in evaluating face completion is that there is no well-accepted metric at present. We conduct a pilot human study for quantitative evaluation, but mainly focus on comparisons between the proposed method and previous state-of-the-art method due to the time-consuming setup of human study. Furthermore, based on the qualitative results shown in Figure 4, we suspect that if performed, the human study may provide consistent evaluation results on the proposed method.

Why do the authors only compare with GL and CTX?\"\nWe study face completion with arbitrary masks in this paper, which is a challenging conditional face synthesis, and different from general unconditional face synthesis. GL and CTX are two of the previous state-of-the-art face completion methods.  And, due to the lack of quantitative metrics for image completion (Yeh et al., Yu et al.), we resort to  evaluate these methods with a \u201cgold standard\u201d, i.e., the human study and careful statistical analyses (Figure 9 and appendix A.2). In the human pilot study, it is more accurate and feasible for the observers to compare the pairs of images (e.g. ours vs. CTX or real vs. synthesized). We can already see our method outperformed state-of-the-art method (CTX) significantly. \n\nQ2: \"the authors do not study how each component affects the final performance, which is very important for the reader to understand why it works.\"\nWe provide an ablation study (Figure 4) which qualitatively shows the impact of essential  components (the proposed FOAM and the well-executed loss functions)  of  our  method. \n\nQ3: \"the framework of the proposed method is very common. This paper only follow previous work and lacks new insights about the problem. \"\nWe agree that the overall proposed framework is common, which is based on progressive GANs, one of the most widely used framework in generative learning. But, we would like to point out that we do not only follow previous work. We present a novel FOAM module that are critical for interpretable and controllable high-resolution face completion without any post-processing. The proposed FOAM addresses the common stability issue in training progressive GANs (as compared in the ablation study, Figure 4). We propose a well-executed set of loss functions which are non-trivial for face completion with arbitrary masks. We also obtain state-of-the-art performance.
