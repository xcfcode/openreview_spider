While these attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a computer program is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive research was carriedout in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous algorithms were introduced, aiming to learn how to perform human tasks such as playing video games. As a result, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) (Bellemare et al., 2013) has become a commonly used benchmark environment allowing algorithms to train on various Atari 2600 games. In many games the state-of-the-art algorithms outperform humans. In this paper we introduce a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment \u2014 RLE, that can run games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), Sega Genesis and several other gaming consoles. The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch. SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to their higher level of complexity and versatility.", "keywords": ["Reinforcement Learning", "Deep learning", "Games"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The authors present a new set of environments, similar to ALE but based on Super Nintendo rather than Atari.

Please see revised paper section 3.2 .\n\nQ: The rivalry training is an interesting idea ... the learner overfits to that opponent and forgets to play against the in-game AI; but then oddly, it gets evaluated on how well it does against the in-game AI!. Also the part of the paper that describes the scientific results (especially the rivalry training) is less polished.. \n\nA: In our second experiment, the goal was to train an agent to achieve a better score vs the in-game AI. Since the trained agent (D-DDQN) beats the in-game AI (as seen in section 4.1.1), we assume that by adding several training episodes against the trained D-DDQN agent results will improve. \nThe fact that the agent overfits that badly to its opponent policy was somewhat surprising, especially since we used the exact same setting for the additional training episodes. The only difference was the rivals policy - we maintained the same characters, same levels and random initialization.\nAn additional experiment we conducted, and incorporated to a later revision, takes this one step further and combines training by alternating the rival's policy in each episode, switching between the in-game AI, a vanilla DQN agent and D-DDQN agent.\nThis indeed lead to a more generalized policy which achieves much better results when evaluate against a new policy (i.e., same game higher difficulty setting. See Section 4.1.2).\n\nThank you for your honest evaluation and reference to other 'venue'.", "title": "comment"}, "HJaxYKU8e": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "S1Jpha-Vl", "comment": "Thank you for your review and comments.\n\nQ: Reward structures: for how many of the possible games have you implemented the means to extract scores\n\nA: All the games we've implemented include the reward function and can be learnt.\nImplementing a game is a process very similar to that in Universe. Adding a game consists of four steps:\n1. Create a new file for the game and adding it to the game list.\n2. Defining the minimal meaningful possible actions for a game.\n3. Defining the starting actions to be performed from initialization until reaching the game screen.\n4. Defining a reward and terminal function by extracting the score from the game's RAM.\n\nIn the following weeks we intent to add several games. A guide describing the process is also available in our wiki: https://github.com/nadavbh12/Retro-Learning-Environment/wiki/How-to-add-a-new-game\nAdditionally, we've added support for new consoles: Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Master System, and several others.\n\nQ:\u201crivalry\u201d training...To avoid controversy, I would recommend not claiming any novel contribution on the topic... Instead, just explain that you have established single-agent and multi-agent baselines for your new benchmark suite.\n\nA: Thank you for pointing that out. We revised the paper and added cited related works. The simplicity of multi-agent training using RLE enabled us to run some interesting experiments. We hope that this will encourage more research in that direction.\n\nWe fixed all your minor comments as well - thank you for pointing them out.", "title": "comment"}, "HJgqOY8Ux": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Sy3UiUz4l", "comment": "Thank you for your review.\n\nQ: With OpenAI Universe and DeepMind Lab that just came out, though, I am not sure we really need another one right now.\n\nA: After we published our first draft of the paper, Universe and Lab were announced, which in some sense appear to deem RLE relevancy. However, we believe that RLE provides value that may compliment other environments rather than replace.\nWhile Universe has the game variety and Lab has speed and access to in-game elements, RLE has all three advantages. In our latest revision, we've included a more through comparison (see table 2 in the revised edition). Moreover we believe that the latest achievements in the growing gaming community including very accurate psychical engines and incredibly realistic scenes which can help create a better AI algorithm. The RLE take the first steps towards combining the two worlds. By using LibRetro environment new consoles can be added easily (we have recently added supported to several additional consoles see section 3.2 in the revised paper).\n\nQ: \"RLE requires an emulator and a computer version of the console game (ROM file)... how is that different from ALE that requires the emulator Stella which is also provided with ALE?\n\nA: ALE is built on top of the Stella emulator, therefore it requires a ROM file only. To make RLE a more general environment we separated the gaming console emulator from the RL framework. This is a more technical detail regarding the interface itself which requires another argument.\n\nQ: Why is there no DQN / DDDQN result on Super Mario?\n\nA: DQN and D-DDQN results on Mario were absent due to our limited computational resources and were added in a later revision (see figure 2).\n\nThanks you for the other comments.

For instance, the need of strategy and avoiding greedy policies, the combination of several tasks  at once (e.g., detecting objects and solving a maze and others).\n\nIn comparison with Universe, we present two major advantages: \nThe first is the speed which you can ran the simulation (hundreds of fps vs 60 fps).\nThe second is our ability to modify and view the game's internals. This allows to train agents with RAM observation and to modify the game's internals (for example, in the game Mortal Kombat, we randomly initialize the positions of both agents).\n\nIn comparison with other single-game environments (Project Malmo, Infinite Mario, etc.) we provide a single environment, encapsulating many games.\nSince games complexity increased through time, we chose the SNES for the preliminary version of RLE so that the challenges will be gradual, and for its wide variety of over 700 games, each will take about an hour to add to the environment.\nSupport of more advanced game consoles will be added in the future with the hope of leading to algorithmic breakthroughs much like ALE did.", "title": "Choosing SNES and Comparing to Other Environments"}, "rkqZwXS7g": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJ6Q5zg7l", "comment": "Thank you for your comment, we will revise the paper and emphasize the different experiments done in the \"Rivalry Training\" section.\n\nThe rivalry training refers to multiplayer games only (currently we have been experimenting on Mortal Kombat, but we intend to investigate other games as well).\n\nIn the second rivalry use you referred to, we trained an agent against the in-game AI initially and measured its performance. Then, we resumed it's training against another pre-trained agent (also trained against the in-game AI) with the hope of improving its performances.\n\nWe observed that the agent tends to learn the best policy against its current opponent. Therefore, the agent's performances against the in-game AI, after being training against an agent of a different algorithm, were inferior to those of an agent who was trained solely against the in-game AI. \nFollowing this observation we decided conduct another experiment in which the agent was trained against both the in-game AI and the additional agent iteratively, switching the opponent after each episode (rather than a large number of epochs against one following the same against the other) with the hope of learning a better generalized policy, the results of this experiment will be incorporated in our next revision.\n\nThe first rivalry use is intended to be a new form of benchmarking inspired by real world competitions in which players are measured by the outcome of the match (win or lose) rather than the actual score.\nThis method is intended to compliment the standard benchmarking method (measuring their scores against the in-game AI), by measuring whether the algorithm overfit the given problem, similarly to the results that appeared in the second method.\n\nIn both cases we use the in-game AI but the evaluation of the agent's performances is done either against the in-game AI or against another agent.
