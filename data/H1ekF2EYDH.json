Up to now, lots of large-scale knowledge graphs have been built. However, most of them are non-Chinese and designed for general purpose. In this work, we introduce TechKG, a large scale Chinese knowledge graph that is technology-oriented. It is built automatically from massive technical papers that are published in Chinese academic journals of different research domains. Some carefully designed heuristic rules are used to extract high quality entities and relations. Totally, it comprises of over 260 million triplets that are built upon more than 52 million entities which come from 38 research domains. Our preliminary experiments indicate that TechKG has high adaptability and can be used as a dataset for many diverse AI-related applications.", "keywords": ["Chinese knowledge graph building"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper presents a large-scale automatically extracted knowledge base in Chinese which contains information about entities and their relations present in academic papers. The authors have collected several papers that come from around 38 different domains. As such this is a dataset creation paper where the authors have used existing methodologies to perform relation extraction in Chinese.\n\nAfter having read the reviews and followup replies by authors, the main criticisms of the paper still hold. In addition to the lack of technical contribution, I feel that the writing of the paper can be improved a lot, for example, I would like to see a table with some example entities and relations extracted. That said, with further improvements this paper could potentially be a good contribution to LREC which is focused on dataset creation.\n\nIn its current form, I recommend the paper to be rejected."}, "review": {"BklNzvG0FS": {"type": "review", "replyto": "H1ekF2EYDH", "review": "I have read the author response, thank you for responding.\n\nOriginal review:\nThis paper presents the extraction of a bibliographic database of Chinese technical papers.  This database could potentially be a valuable resource for the community.  However, the paper is mis-targeted to the ICLR conference, as it does not discuss learning representations or using deep learning (the 36-page appendix does include some material on knowledge graph embedding, but this is not covered in the main body of the paper).  Also, for important tasks like name deduplication, the paper does not discuss or compare against techniques from previous work, and instead proposes a small set of heuristics, which is a sensible approach for building a resource but will not be of interest to the ICLR audience.\n\nThe paper refers to their resource as a knowledge graph, but I would say it is more accurate to call it a bibliographic database (it consists primarily of paper titles, authors, and keywords).  This is very different from the broader KBs and KGs discussed in the related work.  YAGO, Freebase, Cyc, and so on capture a much wider variety of semantic relationships and entity types.  I think re-positioning this submission as being aimed at building a bibliographic database, rather than a Knowledge Graph, would help ensure it reaches the right audience.  Also, targeting a different venue like a digital libraries conference and making a strong case that this set of bibliographic data offers advantages in coverage or accuracy over other comparable resources, if any, would help.\n\nFinally, one of the most valuable features of a bibliographic database is the citation graph, it would be exciting if TechKG could be extended to include citation information.\n\nMinor:\nSection 2, most of these citations should not be shortcites but should be regular full cites.  For example in the first paragraph, Miller (1995) should be (Miller, 1995).\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "1: Reject", "confidence": 3}, "r1gB7ikNsH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1euBO6PcB", "comment": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the thorough and valuable feedback for the manuscript. But we want to clarify some misunderstandings of our paper. \n\n1. Currently, many KG-related applications (such as knowledge graph embedding,  distantly supervised RE, knowledge based QA, etc) use non-Chinese KGs. Researchers won't know whether a model that performs well on these existing KGs could still perform well on other-language KGs. TechKG provides a new choice to evaluate the true ability of a model. This is a very important contribution of TechKG.  \n\n2. The comment \"There is no novelty in the way KG is built,\" is right. But we think that there are three key factors in building a KG like Freebase: scale, cost, and quality. We think these three factors are also the main reason why there are few non-English available KG up to now. TechKG provides a very cheap way to construct a large scale KG with very high quality. The method can be use to construct a KG of any languages. We think his is another important contribution of TechKG.  \n\n3.

But we want to clarify some misunderstandings of our paper.\n\n1. The comment \"The paper does not clearly demonstrate experiment showing how this new knowledge graph can be complementary to or benefit existing realm of machine learning tasks.\" is not accurate. Our experiments(on knowledge graph embedding, distantly supervised RE, and distantly supervised NER) show that TechKG is a more challenging dataset. This indicates that many state-of-the-art methods have to be improved to achieve a similar result as they achieved on some existing KGs. We think this is very important for increasing the robust and transplant of some methods. Obviously, this is of much benefit to existing realm of machine learning tasks.\n\n2.

But we want to clarify some misunderstandings of our paper. \n\n1.We claim in our paper that TechKG is a new Chinese KG and it can be used as a dataset for many diverse AI-related applications. In our primpary experiments in the appendix part, we use three completely different applications to show  the adaptability of TechKG. All of these applications are related to deep learning. Especially, the \"knowledge graph embedding\" application is directly related to representation learning. So we think that our paper matches the scope of ICLR well. \n\n2. \"name deduplication\" is not an important task in TechKG, instead, it is just one of the important characteristics in TechKG (section 4, page 5). Totally, there are three important characteristics that make TechKG be a more challenging dataset for many applications. For example, in the \"knowledge graph embedding\" application, the ConvE model, one of the state-of-the-art method, achieves very poor results. We analyzed the reason in page14.\n\n3. The comment that \"This is very different from the broader KBs and KGs discussed in the related work. \" is right. In Table 8 (page 8) of our paper, we compare the differences between different KGs. TechKG is a very different KG compared with current existing KGs mainly due to the following two reason. First, TechKG is technology-oriented KG, while other KGs are general purpose. Second, TechKG takes technical papers as data source, while most of other KGs take Wikipedia as datasource. Because of these two reasons, both the semantic relationships and the entity types are proper in TechKG. \n\n4. TechKG is a completely different KGs and it provides a new choice for lots of applications: the AI-related applications are diverse, thus there should be diverse datasets. Besides, a lot of new characteristics hierent in TechKG raise new challenges for many existing methods.

There is a huge appendix section with some results and lot of information. It would have been great to distill how KG's are being used in existing benchmarks and either show the value of a tech KG in the metrics/benchmarks or introduce a new metric or benchmark to measure the value of a specific domain KG like the tech KG.\n\nIf the authors can address these issues, the value of the work can increase significantly.", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 4}}}
