This was to equate the amount of data seen by our method.\nAdditionally, the batches were allowed to vary across the 10 network instances tested and also per label randomization probability p.\nThis means that to evaluate each accuracy tradeoff in out experiments (Figures 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10) we randomly sampled 100 batches.\nWe note that each batch contained 50 samples throughout our experiments.\n\nThis choice had no significant impact on our results because of the very small variance across batches.\nFor instance, we measured the AuC of the curves in Figure 3(a) over 6 different runs, i.e., each time using a different per-class batch. Below we report, per label randomization probability p, the mean and the standard deviation:\n\n          \t mean\t  std\np=0.0\t0.9756\t0.0008\np=0.2\t0.8779\t0.0013\np=0.4\t0.7704\t0.0039\np=0.6\t0.6847\t0.0066\np=0.8\t0.6381\t0.0038\n\nWe understand the importance of clarity in our experiments, and we will discuss the batch sensitivity and accuracy variance in the paper.\n\n2) \u201cThis is not a satisfactory explanation unless additional experiments are provided. Figure 2.c shows a rapid drop from conv_3_1 to conv_3_2 and then a sharp increase from 4_1 to 4_3. It sounds ad-hoc to me to assume the first drop is a sudden turn of spatial class-information to non-spatial (channel-wise) class-information and the increase is due to just being close to the final classification layer. While this conjecture can be true, proper experiments should be conducted to confirm this.\"\n\nAs suggested by the reviewer, to support our hypothesis, we performed an extensive layer-by-layer evaluation on the fully-connected network we have trained on Fashion-MNIST.\n\nExcept for the network architecture and dataset, the rest of the experiment is identical to the experiment in Figure 2. This is to validate the effect of spatial arrangement in the early layers of our convolutional network.\n\nThe results (seen here: https://ibb.co/K6GQbRP ) show that in this case the early layers are less robust to compression, as per the reviewer's initial intuition, which supports our hypothesis as to the phenomenon observed in Figure 2.\n\n\n3) \"what is the difference between a \u201cwhole feature map\u201d and \u201cactivations\u201d? Do you mean that for the convolutional layers the approximation is done separately per channel and thus there are different scaling factors per channel for each sample?\"\n\nWe apologize for the ambiguity in our terminology. By 'activations' we were referring to individual C-dimensional vectors comprising the NxCxHxW activation tensor.\nFor NMF and PCA we consider every C-dimensional vector as a single datapoint (of which there are N*H*W), while for classification the network views every 1xCxHxW block as a single datapoint. So while every C-dimensional vector is pointing in the same direction, there is variability due to scale and spatial arrangement within each 1xCxHxW block.\n\n\n4) \u201cI appreciate the additional experiments provided in Ap. 6.4 However, for this to be true, it is important to show that the hyperparameters used (smoothing factor for the approximated training set accuracy plot, batchsize, k, and maybe others) are independent of the dataset. Otherwise, it would diminish the benefit of not needing a validation set since one needs to find the best values on a heldout set.\"\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that more investigation and experiments are required for the practical implementation of the early stopping application of our approach.

In this case, the activation matrix will have a small non-negative rank. An approximation algorithm (via non-negative matrix factorization) is then used to compute the robustness and evaluate the robustness (by replacing the activation matrix with its low rank non-negative activation) is measured in a number of experiments with different amount of random label corruptions. The experiments show that networks trained on random labels are less robust than networks trained on true labels.\n\nWhile the concept is interesting, I find the arguments in the paper a bit vague, and the usefulness of the algorithm might be hampered by its computation complexity, which is not discussed in the paper.\n\nFirst of all, the paper lacks a clear notion of \"memorization\". While it is generally accepted that learns on random labels can be called \"memorization\", the paper seem to be defining it as how well is the network clustering points from the same class. Several questions need to be addressed in order for this notion to be justified:\n\n1. Are (well generalized) networks really clustering samples of the same class to a centroid? It would be great if some empirical verifications are shown. Because the networks are using linear classifier in the last layer to classify the samples, it seems only linearly separability would be suffice for the work, which does not necessarily imply clustering.\n\n2. Given two networks (of the same architecture), assume somehow network-1 decides to use the first 9 layers to compute a well clustered representation, while network-2 decides to use the first 5 layers to do the same thing. Do we say network-1 is (more) memorizing in this case?\n\n3. The notion seems to be more about the underlying task than about the networks. Given the measurement, if a task is more complicated, meaning the input samples in the class have higher variance and requiring more efforts to cluster, then it seems the network will be doing more memorization. In other words, while networks will be doing more memorization when comparing a random label task to a true label task, it might also be \"doing more memorization\" when comparing learning on imagenet to learning on MNIST / CIFAR. One the one hand, this does not seem to fit our \"intuition\" about memorization; on the other hand, the heavy dependency on the underlying data distribution makes it difficult to compare results learned on different data -- especially since the measurements are based on per-class samples, \"random labels\" and \"true labels\" have very different class-conditional distributions.\n\nI also have some questions about Figure 2(c). I will continue numbering the question for easier discussion.\n\n4. Why for all cases, the lower layers all have higher AUC than the higher layers (except the last one)? The argument given in the paper is that the lower layers are the feature extraction phase while the upper layers are memorization phase. I think if clearly verified, this is a very interesting observation. But the paper currently do not have experiments to verify the hypothesis. Also more studies on this with different networks would be good. For example, with deeper networks, does the feature extraction phase include more layers?\n\n5. The p=1 and p<1 curves seem to be very different. If one is to sample more densely between p=0.8 and p=1, would there still be a clear phase transition?\n\nSome other questions:\n\n6. Can you add discussions to the computation requirements for the proposed analysis? This is especially important for the cases where the analysis is used during training as tools to help deciding early stopping.\n\n7. For the early stopping experiment, the main text says \"These include the test error (in blue)\" while in the figure the label axis is \"Test loss\". I'm assuming it is the cross entropy loss given the values are greater than 1. In this case, can you show in parallel the same plots in error rate, as the test error is more important than the test loss and the test loss could sometimes be artificially huge due to high confident mistakes on ambiguous test examples.\n\nSome minor issues:\n\n* Please proof read the paper for typos.

However, associating these deep polytopes with polytopes in input space is a non-trivial problem which is concerned with \"network interpretability\", an active area of research.\n\n\"How can one obtain a measure that is independent of the number of samples in the batch?\"\nThe approach presented in the paper is based on the properties of activation matrices, which inherently depends on a batch and therefore its size.

A next step would be to regularize this or a dependent quantity.

How is this batch selected? How sensitive the evaluation is to the selection of the batch members and its size?\nDo the batches cover the whole set?\n\n- Figure 2.a and 2.b: How come all networks with different label noise levels end up with the same (100%?) accuracy? Are the fixed samples different for each p? (class labels change for each p).\n\n- Figure 2.c: Why should the performance drop more when linearizing the middle layers (3_2:4_2) than the earlier layers. This seems to be in violation of the assumption about class invariance in deeper layers.\n\n- When k=1 for NMF and PCA, the difference of the activations for different samples becomes a matter of scale. In this case, shouldn\u2019t all classifications become the same for all samples? How does this affect the accuracy? Does it make the evaluation very sensitive to the sampling of the batch? It would be interesting to study the property of the basis obtained in this border case. The same questions can be studied as one gradually increases k.\nSection 4.2: It starts with the sentence \u201cIn this section we show our technique is useful for predicting good generalization in a more realistic setting\u201c. Indeed, the high correlation of the test performance and the proposed memorization measure in this section is very interesting.

I have a concern here. Apart from the last layer, this form of simplicity of the support for the intermediate layers of a good classifier does not seem to be *necessarily*. That is, it seems to me that as long as the activation matrix of each class is linearly separable from the activation matrices of the others, there is no need for it to become simpler (by reducing the intra-class variations at the deep layers) for the classification loss to be minimized. Does this mean the paper\u2019s assumption for memorization is not necessarily valid?\n\n- The paper relates the memorization to the extent of local linearity of a deep ReLU network. ReLU networks represent piece-wise linear functions. Thus, in order for this relation to be drawn, probably different linear regions (polytopes in the input space) should be considered for the linearization of the activation matrix. In that regard, how can this empirical measurement be translated into a more formal linearity of the global function?\n\n- The rc number as well as the rank k of a good approximation directly depend on the number of samples in the batch. How can one obtain a measure that is independent of the number of samples in the batch?\n\n\nSummary judgment:\n\nThe paper puts forward an interesting observation using a novel approach.
