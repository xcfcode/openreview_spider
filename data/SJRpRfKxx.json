This has motivated researchers to design attentional models that can dynamically focus on parts of images or videos that are salient, e.g., by down-weighting irrelevant pixels. In this work, we propose a spatiotemporal attentional model that learns where to look in a video directly from human fixation data. We model visual attention with a mixture of Gaussians at each frame. This distribution is used to express the probability of saliency for each pixel. Time consistency in videos is modeled hierarchically by: 1) deep 3D convolutional features to represent spatial and short-term time relations and 2) a long short-term memory network on top that aggregates the clip-level representation of sequential clips and therefore expands the temporal domain from few frames to seconds. The parameters of the proposed model are optimized via maximum likelihood estimation using human fixations as training data, without knowledge of the action in each video. Our experiments on Hollywood2 show state-of-the-art performance on saliency prediction for video. We also show that  our attentional model trained on Hollywood2 generalizes well to UCF101 and it can be leveraged to improve action classification accuracy on both datasets.", "keywords": ["Computer vision", "Deep learning", "Applications"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper describes a model for video saliency prediction using a combination of spatio-temporal ConvNet features and LSTM.

The context features represent the video in its entirety. Therefore they may contain elements from the background, which may be useful for action categorization but at times also potentially distracting. Instead, the attention part focuses only on the most salient spatiotemporal volumes in the video. We agree that there are many other ways to use the saliency maps produced by our model. For example, the saliency map could be used to sample higher-resolution crops of the frames. We opted for the simplest model in order to show that what is contributing to the improvement in action categorization is truly coming from the saliency map and not from a more complex model.\n\n\u201cComparison between [(1), (2)] and (3) seems unfair.\u201d As we mentioned in the pre-review answer \u201cAnswer to few questions, comments\u201d, we ran an experiment with PCA to yield the same feature dimensionality as (1) in order to have a more fair comparison. The resulting testing mAP of this compressed descriptor (using both context and attention) is 51.82%, which is quite a bit better than method (1) (based on context only), despite having the same dimensionality. We added this relevant result to the paper (last paragraph in page 8).\n\nThe number of fixations are randomly subsampled (first paragraph, Sec. 3.1) if greater than A. Conversely, they are  randomly duplicated if less than A. \n\nIn our experiments, we froze the layers of the C3D. We ran several fine-tuning experiments for action recognition using the Hollywood2 dataset, however we have never obtained any significant improvement. We think that this might be due to the small size of the dataset and to the fact that the C3D features are already representative and general since they were trained on a huge dataset. This discouraged us to run fine-tuning experiments for saliency prediction.\n\nAbout feature concatenation: for each clip, we stacked the d-dimensional context feature vector on top of the d-dimensional attention-based feature vector to form a (2*d)-dimensional descriptor.\n", "title": "Answer to Review"}, "rylbemnBx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkxeboW4g", "comment": "As mentioned in the pre-review answer \u201cAnswer to Central Bias\u201d, the trained central bias is reported in Table 1 while Table 2 reports the manually-created central bias from Mathe & Sminchisescu, 2015.

However, this information is missing from their paper.\nWe clarified these points in the new version of the manuscript (last paragraph of Sec. 4.1).\n\nOur results on Table 2 are in between the human performance and the trained central bias. We agree that AUC is not the best metric for evaluation because of the saturation problem. In fact we used also NSS, CC and Sim to evaluate the variants of our method. However, we needed to use the AUC to compare with the methods of Mathe & Sminchisescu, 2015.\n\nAbout the evaluation in Table 3, we wanted to evaluate two different ways to merge the saliency map.

We did it to facilitate evaluation and to have a normalized reweighting of the video for the action recognition task. In practice, one can use directly the learned Gaussian mixture as probability distribution, to sample fixations for example. When there is nothing salient in the image (e.g., when the ground truth human fixations are spread and do not show a clear pattern), the model still outputs a saliency map. But in such cases we empirically observed that the variances of the Gaussian components are quite large, and they collectively approximate the uniform distribution.\n\nThe concatenation of the two descriptors produces a representation that 1) includes the general context of the action in the videos and 2) down-weights pixels deemed less important, thus encouraging the recognition model to focus on parts that may be more salient. Since the RMDN is computing anyway the context features for each clip in order to estimate the saliency map, reusing them for action recognition seems straightforward and does not add computations. \n\nWe sent an email to the authors requesting their runtimes for comparison. Unfortunately, we cannot promise that they will respond in time.\n\nThe SVM model complexity for experiment (3) in Table 3 is indeed twice as large as the complexity for [(1),(2)]. The same applies when comparing (5) against [(1),(4)]. In fact, we added PCA dimensionality reduction to experiment (5) in order to match the same feature dimensionality as (1) (and (4)). Although the validation accuracies are similar, the testing mAP drops from 54.85% of experiment (5) to 51.82% of the PCA experiment. This is not surprising, since the extra dimensions provided by the use of the saliency map are not redundant with respect to the context representation (1).
