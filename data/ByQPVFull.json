Besides, when auxiliary annotations are available for specific data, simply ignoring them would be a great waste. In this paper, we incorporate these auxiliary annotations as privileged information and propose a novel CNN  model that is able to maximize inherent diversity of a CNN model such that the model can learn better feature representation with a stronger generalization ability. More specifically, we propose a group orthogonal convolutional neural network (GoCNN) to learn features from foreground and background in an orthogonal way by exploiting privileged information for optimization, which automatically emphasizes feature diversity within a single model. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, ImageNet and PASCAL VOC, well demonstrate the effectiveness and high generalization ability of our proposed GoCNN models.", "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Computer vision", "Supervised Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper was reviewed by three experts.

Concretely, \"DeCov\" penalizes the covariance in an unsupervised fashion and cannot utilize extra available annotations, leading to insignificant performance improvement over vanilla models. For instance, the performance enhancement brought by \"DeCov\"(NiN) is quite marginal on ImageNet dataset compared with \"Dropout\"(NiN), see Table 5 (val top1/top5) in DeCov paper. When they intentionally increase the model complexity (i.e., NiN->AlexNet) with greater overfitting risk, the \"DeCov\" method performs even worse than a simple baseline method (\"Dropout\"), see Fig. 5 (left; val accuracy) in the DeCov paper.\n\nIn contrast, \"GoCNN\" regularizes the covariance (such that increases feature independency and diversity) in a supervised way. Thus \"GoCNN\" can fully utilize rich extra information (segmentation masks here).
