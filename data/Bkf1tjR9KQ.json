In addition to the fact that it presents a faster alternative to hand-designed architectures, it can improve their efficiency and for instance generate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) adapted for mobile devices. In this paper, we present a multi-objective neural architecture search method to find a family of CNN models with the best accuracy and computational resources tradeoffs, in a search space inspired by the state-of-the-art findings in neural search. Our work, called Dvolver, evolves a population of architectures and iteratively improves an approximation of the optimal Pareto front. Applying Dvolver on the model accuracy and on the number of floating points operations as objective functions, we are able to find, in only 2.5 days 1 , a set of competitive mobile models on ImageNet. Amongst these models one architecture has the same Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet as NASNet-A mobile with 8% less floating point operations and another one has a Top-1 accuracy of 75.28% on ImageNet exceeding by 0.28% the best MobileNetV2 model for the same computational resources.", "keywords": ["architecture search", "Pareto optimality", "multi-objective", "optimization", "cnn", "deep learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper describes an architecture search method which optimises multiple objectives using a genetic algorithm.

The method by Dong et al. requires only 8 GPU days (Dvolver requires 50) yielding very similar results. Why this has been ignored remains unclear.\"\n\nResponse: Thanks for pointing the missing comparison with DPP-Net, we updated the paper with their results.\n          We argue that the search space of DPP-Net is too small to prove that their method is efficient. There are only 324 possible architectures with 4 layers which can be searched exhaustively.\n          DPP-Net is an extension of Progressive NAS with multi-objective optimization but their search space is different. We cannot conclude on their effectiveness in these conditions.\n\n\n\"The paper is not self-contained, important methodological aspects of the method are insufficiently described. I recommend at least to formally define the crowding distance. It would be also reasonable to define your objective functions already in Section 3 instead of mentioning them in the caption of Figure 3 and its axis labels.\"\n\nResponse: Thanks for pointing the missing information. We update the paper with more details and an appendix with algorithm details.\n          We also added the source code and checkpoints for easy reproduction.\n\n\"I think it's fair to call your approach evolutionary but you might want to discuss its relationship to beam search and in this scope discuss [A].\"\n\nResponse: [A] is a single objective method that evolves a single architecture from a simple to a more complex one.\n          It is a very different evolutionary approach than ours. We work with a population of individuals (architectures), then breed and mutate them to create new generations of architectures better than their parents.\n          It is the interactions between the individuals that is important in our method.\n\n\n\"The comparison in Table 2 is not fair. You use the swift activation function and do not report the corresponding numbers for MobileNet or Mobile NASNet. Ramachandran et al. (2017) report these (75% and 74.2% for NASNet and MobileNet).\nComparing the Dvolver architecture with ReLU activations to MobileNet does not indicate any improvements.\"\n\nResponse: First we compare NASNet and DVOLVER without swish to prove that single objective search is less efficient than multi-objective method.\n          Then, in table 3, We want to push our cells to the maximum and compare with the best results found in previous works. We added NASNet swish and showed that DVOLVER still has better accuracy than NASNet.\n          We added the best results found in state-of-the-art works for mobile architecture and found that DVOLVER is very competitive.\n          Ramachandran et al. 2017(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941.pdf), state that MobileNet can benefit from swish and the publication date implies that it is MobileNet V1.\n          Their paper states that MobileNet with RELU is at 72% (Table 8) but we could not find any reference for MobileNet V1 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) with that accuracy. Without more details, we cannot add this values in our paper but will if we can find more details.\n          We think it is fair to compare with the best results found in previous works and it is not the subject of our paper to optimize other architectures.\n\n\n\"You mention that most previous approaches are only keeping track of the best solution while you evolve over a population.

Ideally, we should train all the architectures in the Pareto front but it is very expensive.\n          Our selection process is as follow:\n          * take the cell with the best accuracy (DVOLVER-A), then take 2 more on Pareto front knees (where small drop in accuracy leads to great improvement in speed): DVOLVER-B & C.\n          * Then for all N, F and cells compute MACs and we select the few with MACs comparable with existing networks with want to compare with.\n\n          Our goal is to easy comparison with competitive architectures.\n", "title": "Experimental update and review answer"}, "ryeL_QZ9hm": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Bkf1tjR9KQ", "review": "The paper proposes a multi-objective search algorithm that designs resource-efficient convolutional architectures. The key idea is to maintain a population of networks and to iteratively approach the Pareto front through evolution. The normal & reduction cells are searched on CIFAR-10 and then transferred to ImageNet. The resulting architectures empirically lead to better trade-offs than other baselines.\n\nPros:\nThe paper is well-written and easy to comprehend.\nResults are competitive against strong baselines such as NASNet.\nResource budgets are handled in a principled manner with multi-objective optimization. \n\nCons:\n\nMy main concerns are on the technical novelty and experimental comparison.\n\nTechnical novelty:\n\nThe proposed algorithm seems highly similar to the existing multi-objective NAS algorithms, especially the ones based on Pareto optimality [1,2,3]. In Sect 2, the authors state that the main difference from prior works such as [2] and [3] is the usage of a different and larger search space and large-scale experiments. However, both aspects are of limited technical novelty.\n\nExperimental comparison:\n\nIn sect 3.3, the authors say \u201cwe noticed that the original NASNet search space can greatly benefit from extra connections from any given block\u201d. If the proposed algorithm was investigated in an enhanced version of the NASNet space, it would be unclear whether we should attribute the reported performance to the proposed multi-objective evolution or this additional search space engineering. It would be better to report the results using the original space as well for fair comparison. \n\nThe main claimed contribution is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. To demonstrate its effectiveness, it would be necessary to compare against existent multi-objective NAS strategies in the literature. Most of those strategies (e.g., scalarization, weighted product method) should be straightforward to implement on top of the current search space. The current results are less convincing since the authors only compared their method against single-objective baselines (e.g. NASNet, PNAS, AmoebaNet) which are completely unaware of additional dimensions of the desired objectives. \n\nThe networks are searched on CIFAR-10 and then transferred to ImageNet. Unlike most prior works (including the ones focusing on resource-constrained NAS), the authors did not the final performance of their architecture on CIFAR-10. It would be informative to report the CIFAR-10 results as well.\n\nOther suggestions & questions:\nThe authors did not report their training setup for ImageNet. It would be good to include those details to ensure the readers are informed should there are any additional augmentations.\n\n\u201cuniform mutation and a crossover probability of 0.1\u201d (sect 4.1)\nIt would be better to included more details on these evolution forces for reproducibility. These are also important component of the proposed algorithm.\n\n\u201cWe manually select 3 architectures that we will be fully train on ImageNet in Section 4.2\u201d (sect 4.1)\nI believe this part needs more clarifications since there can be a large number of architectures on the Pareto front.
