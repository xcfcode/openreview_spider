", "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is the task of jointly learning entity and relation embeddings for a given knowledge graph. Existing methods for learning KGEs can be seen as a two-stage process where (a) entities and relations in the knowledge graph are represented using some linear algebraic structures (embeddings), and (b) a scoring function is defined that evaluates the strength of a relation that holds between two entities using the corresponding relation and entity embeddings. Unfortunately, prior proposals for the scoring functions in the first step have been heuristically motivated, and it is unclear as to how the scoring functions in KGEs relate to the generation process of the underlying knowledge graph. To address this issue, we propose a generative account of the KGE learning task. Specifically, given a knowledge graph represented by a set of relational triples (h, R, t), where the semantic relation R holds between the two entities h (head) and t (tail), we extend the random walk model (Arora et al., 2016a) of word embeddings to KGE. We derive a theoretical relationship between the joint probability p(h, R, t) and the embeddings of h, R and t. Moreover, we show that marginal loss minimisation, a popular objective used by much prior work in KGE, follows naturally from the log-likelihood ratio maximisation under the probabilities estimated from the KGEs according to our theoretical relationship. We propose a learning objective motivated by the theoretical analysis to learn KGEs from a given knowledge graph. The KGEs learnt by our proposed method obtain state-of-the-art performance on FB15K237 and WN18RR benchmark datasets, providing empirical evidence in support of the theory.\n", "keywords": ["relation representations", "natural language processing", "theoretical analysis", "knowledge graphs"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper proposes a new scoring function for link prediction model that is based on a generative model for the knowledge graph, based on a random-walk model previously used for word embeddings.

The authors validate their proposed approach through several experiments. \n\nThis paper reads well and the results appear sound. I personally find the theoretical argument behind the proposed scoring function very interesting. Unfortunately, the contribution seems rather small to be accepted for ICLR. This is a straight application and combination of existing pieces with not much originality and without being backed up by very strong experimental results. My concerns are as follows:\n\n   - Having only results on two flawed datasets (considering the inverse relations in them) makes it hard to evaluate the quality of the method. I suggest conducting the experiments on the FB15K-237 and WN18RR from [1] instead. \n   - You only evaluate on MR and Hits@10, but it is standard to include metrics like MRR and Hits@1 and 3 also, since no metric is perfect for this task.\n   - Since the goal of the work is not providing a state of the art method, and focus on the theoretical understanding of their scoring function, it is of high importance to assess the characteristics of their embeddings and scoring function through designing other experiments.

Therefore, this does look like a very obvious application, and it is not clear to me if this paper presents any new methods or if you have obtained any new insights. \n\nAns: We would like to thank the reviewer for the time and review. \n\nIt is true that we are extending the original Random Walk model proposed by Arora et al [2016a] to model relations. However, we do not agree that is a \u201cvery obvious application\u201d. Next, we detail the reasons for this.\n\nThe original random walk model was proposed for a co-occurrence graph, ignoring the relations between the entities. It is nontrivial as how to incorporate relational information into this model. We have both proposed a new relational version of the original random walk model and have proven that it can obtain state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings.\n\nQ2: The paper claims that all prior work use some sort of heuristics in the KGE task, and their approach is a generative account that might deal with this issue? But I personally found that by using a random walk and the exp function, you are also making some very strong assumptions that are similar to heuristics? How do you know it is exp function but not other function?\n\nAns: This is a very standard way to represent the potential function in a probabilistic graph. Moreover, as you can see from the Taylor expansion of exp, it contains all polynomials terms in it. In fact, prior work on kernel methods have shown that exponential kernels such as Radial Basis Functions (RBF) kernel can theoretically subsume all other types of kernel functions. Therefore, this is not a heuristic but a very general modelling assumption that does not assume anything about the properties of entities and their relations.\n\n Q3:  I am not sure what the purpose for the evaluation section is. You mention that this paper is not about state-of-the-art results, but if your theory really works, your scoring function should beat SOTA results. Overall, I have to say that I am very disappointed with this paper, because there are no new theoretical tools being introduced, and the authors seem to be applying Arora et al., 2016a from word embedding to KGE only. \n\nAns: At the initial submission of the paper, we did not have state-of-the-art results for KGE. Therefore, we did not claim this in the initial submission. However, we have obtained state-of-the-art results for FB15k237 and WN18RR datasets as shown in the updated version of the paper. Note that FB15k237 and WN18RR datasets were recently proposed by removing reverse relations that were easier to predict in the original versions of those two datasets.
