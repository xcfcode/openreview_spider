Several existing approaches utilize linear relaxation based neural network output bounds under perturbation, but they can slow down training by a factor of hundreds depending on the underlying network architectures. Meanwhile, interval bound propagation (IBP) based training is efficient and significantly outperforms linear relaxation based methods on many tasks, yet it may suffer from stability issues since the bounds are much looser especially at the beginning of training. In this paper, we propose a new certified adversarial training method, CROWN-IBP, by combining the fast IBP bounds in a forward bounding pass and a tight linear relaxation based bound, CROWN, in a backward bounding pass. CROWN-IBP is computationally efficient and consistently outperforms IBP baselines on training verifiably robust neural networks. We conduct large scale experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and outperform all previous linear relaxation and bound propagation based certified defenses in L_inf robustness.\nNotably, we achieve 7.02% verified test error on MNIST at epsilon=0.3, and 66.94% on CIFAR-10 with epsilon=8/255.", "keywords": ["Robust Neural Networks", "Verifiable Training", "Certified Adversarial Defense"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "This paper presents a method that hybridizes the strategies of linear programming and interval bound propagation to improve adversarial robustness.

The use of TPUs to achieve SOTA results may be a concern, so we have implemented a multi-GPU version of CROWN-IBP. To train the SOTA CIFAR model, it takes 1 day on 4 GPUs and the obtained verified accuracy is similar to the results obtained on TPUs. Results are provided in Appendix G, Table H. We will open source our multi-GPU training code.\n\n2. We have improved the implementation of CROWN-IBP. Running time measurement is provided in Appendix J, Table G. For the largest network, CROWN-IBP is just about twice slower than IBP (both are trained on 4 GPUs). We also discussed these results in Appendix J.\n\n3. We have included performance evaluation on a large amount of smaller models trained on a single GPU (in Table C, Appendix F) by investigating performance statistics (min/median/max). This prevents hand-tuning on a small set of models, and we can consistently outperform IBP over a large range of models.\n\n4. We have added more discussions on why a tighter bound can stabilize IBP training in Appendix B and bound tightness comparison between IBP and CROWN-IBP (Figure B).\n\n5.

(\u201cLack of any theoretical insights/motivation for the proposed method\u201d)\n\nThe paper was motivated by the success and weakness of IBP. Gowal et al. showed that with careful tuning, IBP can significantly outperform convex relaxation-based defense (e.g., on MNIST epsilon=0.3 it reduces verified error from 40% to <10%). We believe part of the reason is that convex relaxation-based methods overregularize the network in large epsilon regime, as we observe in Figure 1. However, in practice, IBP training can be unstable, as shown in Figure 3, where IBP cannot converge very well in all settings. The reason for unstable training is due to the loose bound at the beginning of training, as we have explained in (Q1) above. Additionally, IBP is computationally very cheap (so bounds are loose) but convex relaxation-based methods are in the order of 100X more expensive (see Table G) to obtain tighter bounds.\n\nThe combination of the two bounds helps us get the best of both worlds (which is also mentioned by AnonReviewer1): tighter bounds at the beginning of training so more stable training (see Q1 above); no overregularization since we can gradually decay the convex relaxation bounds when epsilon increases; much better computational efficiency compared to regular convex relaxation-based methods since we reuse IBP bounds for intermediate layers.\n\nBoth convex relaxation-based methods (see Salman et al., 2019 for an overview) and IBP are theoretically sound bounds, the combination of them are still sound and within the minimax optimization framework (Eq. 2). However, we agree that there is no theoretical answers to the questions why IBP works better than convex relaxations for large perturbation radii, and why convex relaxation-based approach over-regularize. We discussed a possible hypothesis in Appendix A, however, we believe this is still an open challenge and beyond the scope of our paper.\n\n\n(Q4) Novelty seems small\n\nOur paper is the first to propose such a unique combination of convex relaxation and IBP based verifiable training procedure, and our empirical results achieve state-of-the-art, outperforming all baseline methods in all settings significantly on MNIST and CIFAR-10.\n\nMost importantly, our paper is not a naive combination of two methods. There are lots of rationales behind the scenes:\n\n1. As discussed in (Q1) and (Q3), we carefully considered the strengths and weaknesses of both IBP and convex relaxation-based method, provided empirical studies (Table 1 and Figure 1) and designed our method to exploit the strengths of both methods. It is not a naive combination of two random methods; this combination has a clear justification: improve stability at the beginning phase of training and avoid overfitting at the late phase of training.\n\n2. The computational cost of the convex relaxation-based method is typically very high. A naive combination will not overcome the drawback of high computational complexity. CROWN-IBP cleverly avoids this problem by re-using IBP bounds as intermediate layer results for convex relaxation, reducing the complexity of convex relaxation-based method from $O(L^2 n^3)$ to $O(L n^2 n_L)$ where usually $n_L$ is much less than $n$ (see the \u201cComputational Cost\u201d paragraph on page 7). The reduction of computation is in the order of 100 (see Table G, training time comparison).\n\n3. Additionally, CROWN-IBP allows efficient implementation for convolutional networks on accelerators (GPUs/TPUs), because the backward bound propagation pass always starts from the last specification vector, which is guaranteed to be a small dense matrix. (See page 7, paragraph \u201cComputational Cost\u201d for detailed discussions).\n\n--to be continued", "title": "Continue"}, "H1eLlPRmjr": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1eplpk-5H", "comment": "Dear AnonReviewer2,\n\nWe thank you for recognizing the contributions of our paper and raising the discussions on randomized smoothing and concerns on expensive computations on TPUs.\n\n(Answer 1) Compared to the randomized smoothing based method, our bound propagation-based approach has several theoretical and practical benefits:\n\n1. Recent works [1][2] show that randomized smoothing may not scale well for the important case of L infinity robustness. They provided some preliminary theoretical evidence that even the *optimal* robustness certificate for L infinity smoothing has a dependency on dimension d, thus for high dimensional input (e.g., CIFAR with d=3072), randomized smoothing based method cannot give a good quality bound. On the other hand, for L2 norm, the randomized smoothing certificate is dimension-free. This is a fundamental limitation of randomized smoothing. For the L infinity setting like CIFAR epsilon=8/255, bound propagation-based method like CROWN-IBP still gives the best results.\n\n2. As also mentioned by the reviewer, randomized smoothing typically needs a large number of samples, e.g., in Cohen et al., 100,000 random samples for a *single* image. In contrast, our verification can be computed using IBP very fast, which is only 2x forward propagation time. Randomized smoothing costs 50,000x more during inference, and our training procedure is 500x (pessimistically) slower during training time. So it is really a trade-off here; each method has its own strength.\n\nBeing scalable to large networks on all important norms with less training/inference cost is still an open challenge. It is not solved by randomized smoothing, nor CROWN-IBP. For the next step, our future work will investigate how to combine the strengths from bound propagation-based certified defense (good for L infinity norm, sample free) and randomized smoothing based approach (good for L2 norm, need a lot of samples). Thus, our contribution as the SOTA bound propagation-based certified defense is important, as it can become an ingredient of the next generation certified defense.\n\n(Answer 2) Regarding computation cost, the use of 32 TPUs is not necessary. We use TPUs mainly for obtaining a completely fair comparison to IBP (Gowal et al, 2018), as their implementation was TPU-based. We additionally implemented CROWN-IBP using multi-GPUs. Training the same largest CIFAR network takes 1 day on 4x 1080 Ti GPUs (using the same hyperparameters), and we can achieve similar accuracy. We think this computational cost is quite reasonable, compared to other SOTA uncertified defense like adversarial training, which is also quite slow (10-20x extra cost for each epoch, and needs much more epochs to converge than natural training). \n\nWe updated new multi-GPU training results in Table H, and we will open source our multi-GPU training code to make our algorithm available to a broader audience. \n\nWe hope our response addresses your concerns on TPU training and randomized smoothing, and please kindly let us know if you have any further questions.\n\nReferences:\n[1] A Unified Framework for Randomized Smoothing based Certified Defense. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryl71a4YPB\n[2] Filling the Soap of Bubbles: Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Certification with Non-gaussian smoothing. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Skg8gJBFvr", "title": "Thank you for the discussions on randomized smoothing; TPUs are not necessary for CROWN-IBP (Multi-GPU version will be released)"}, "Skx-gURXsS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJgnxLMMcH", "comment": "Dear AnonReviewer3,\n\nThank you for providing your helpful feedback. Sorry for the potential confusion in our paper and we would like to clarify them in our response, and we have added relevant discussions to our revision.\n\n(Q1) Why does loose bounds result in unstable training? Tighter bounds stabilize training?\n\nLoose bounds (lower bounds on margins $\\underline{m}$, as defined on page 4 \u201cverification specifications\u201d) give a loose upper bound of the minimax loss (Eq. 4); in other words, the \u201crobust loss\u201d term in (9) will become very large. A large robust loss can be a challenge for the optimizer to minimize, and training can easily diverge or stuck at random guess level.\n\nMore specifically, we will explain why a tighter bound like CROWN-IBP can help to stabilize IBP training.\n\nWhen taking a randomly initialized network or a naturally trained network, IBP bounds are very loose. But in Table 1, we show that a network trained using IBP can eventually obtain quite tight IBP bounds and high verified accuracy (i.e., the network can adapt to IBP bounds and learn a specific set of weights to make IBP tight and also correctly classify examples). However, since the training has to start from weights that produce loose bounds for IBP, the beginning phase of IBP training can be challenging and is vitally important.\n\nWe observe that IBP training can have a large performance variance across models and initializations. Also, IBP is more sensitive to hyper-parameters like kappa or schedule length; as you can see in Figure 3, many IBP models failed to converge (large worst/median verified error) with some kappa or schedule length settings. The reason for instability is that during the beginning phase of training, the loose bounds produced by IBP make the robust loss (Eq. 9) explode, and it is challenging for the optimizer to reduce this loss and find a set of good weights that produce tight IBP verified bounds in the end.\n\nConversely, if our bounds are much tighter at the beginning, the robust loss (Eq. 9) always remains in a reasonable range during training, and the network can gradually learn to find a good set of weights that make IBP bounds increasingly tighter. Initially, tighter bounds can be provided by a convex relaxation-based method, and the convex relaxation bounds are gradually replaced by IBP bound (using beta_start=1, beta_end=0), eventually leading to a model with learned tight IBP bounds in the end.\n\nTo give you some intuitions on how much tighter CROWN-IBP is than IBP, in appendix B, we added a figure comparing the tightness between IBP bound and CROWN-IBP bound. We take the difference between the two bounds (CROWN-IBP bound minus IBP bound) and plot this difference during the training procedure. At the beginning of training, the bound difference can be very large, and the network gradually learns how to make the IBP bounds tighter during the training process. The use of tighter bounds at the beginning prevents divergence and can guide the network to learn better IBP bounds and achieve better-verified accuracy.\n\n(Q2) why not just combine the natural loss with the tight bound, as natural loss can be seen as the loosest bound? Is IBP crucial? and why?\n\nThe natural loss does not provide a bound. The loosest bound is negative infinity, and it will explode the robust loss in Eq. (9). (see page 4, verification specifications, for the definition of this lower bound on margin, and Eq (4) for how to use it to get an upper bound for the minimax loss).\n\nIBP is crucial because it can provide us with a bound for computing the robust loss. Natural training cannot provide such bounds. Additionally, a network trained using natural loss is not robust and difficult to verify with current techniques. Models trained using IBP bounds as $\\underline{m}$ in Eq. (9) can be quickly verified using IBP.\n\n--to be continued", "title": "More explanations on the bounds and why tight bounds can stabilize training"}, "BklFgrR7jH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJeZNqlpqH", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the encouraging comments and constructive feedback. We really appreciate the reviewer\u2019s precise characterization of the contributions in our work. We provide answers to the raised questions/cons below.\n\n(Q1). Extensive experiments on advanced networks/datasets\n\nIn our paper we use the same networks as the previous work (Gowal et al. 2018), to stay comparable with their results, which we call DM-Small, DM-Medium, and DM-Large. During the preparation of this submission, we tried much wider networks by increasing the width of the DM-Large model twice and four times, but they did not yield significant performance improvement. Thus we decided to keep models the same as in previous work for a straightforward comparison. We plan to implement more advanced networks (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet, etc) as the next step and scale to larger datasets is our future work.\n\nBesides the three models presented in the submitted version of the paper, in this revision, we additionally provide more comprehensive experiments on a large range of MNIST and CIFAR-10 models (18 MNIST models + 17 CIFAR models). The purpose of this experiment is to compare model performance statistics (min, median, and max) on a wide range of models, rather than a few hand-selected models. The results are presented in Appendix F, Table D. On all model structures and parameter settings, CROWN-IBP can outperform IBP in terms of best, median and worst verified errors. Especially, in many situations, the worst-case verified error improves significantly using CROWN-IBP because IBP training is not stable on some of the models. \n\n(Q2). More elaborate insights into the choice of the training config/hyper-params:\n\nThis is a very good suggestion. kappa controls the trade-off between verified accuracy and standard (clean) accuracy and we typically recommend kappa_start=1 and kappa_end=0. beta determines if we want to use a convex relaxation-based the bound or IBP based bound; the general recommendation is to set beta_start=1 and beta_end=0. We added three paragraphs at the end of Appendix B to discuss the selection of hyperparameters in detail.\n\n(Q3). Breakdown of the cost between different layers and operations:\n\nThe per-layer cost for propagating the CROWN-IBP bound backward is actually quite simple: in a high level, for all operations in the neural network, it is $n_L - 1$ times ($n_L$ is the number of classes, for MNIST/CIFAR it is 10) more expensive than forward propagation as there are $n_L - 1$ specifications per example. Thus CROWN-IBP is well suited to problems where the number of classes is small (more classes can be done efficiently by subsampling of specifications, which is left to future work). CROWN-IBP is significantly more efficient than CROWN (Zhang et al., 2018) and convex adversarial polytope (Wong et al., 2018); it is $L n$ times faster than these approaches, where $L$ is the number of layers and $n$ is hidden layer size. Generally, (ordinary) CROWN and convex adversarial polytopes are too slow for training.\n\nPractically, CROWN-IBP training time can be much less than $n_L - 1$ times slower than IBP, as CROWN-IBP is typically only used during the epsilon schedule rather than the entire training process, and CROWN-IBP generally executes more efficiently than IBP on parallel hardware because it packs denser computation that utilizes hardware accelerators better.\n\nEmpirically, we have further optimized the implementation of CROWN-IBP (with roughly 2X reduction in training time in Table G), and we have prepared a multi-GPU version that can train the largest CIFAR-10 model in about 1 day using 4 GPUs. We have provided updated training time measurement in Appendix J and Table G. On the largest CIFAR-10 model, training using CROWN-IBP is actually only about twice slower than IBP.\n\n\n(Q4). Complementary techniques such as lower precision/quantization:\n\nTo see if bfloat16 has any impact on training results, we additionally implement CROWN-IBP on multi-GPUs with float32. We train the CIFAR-10 model using the same hyperparameters as on TPUs and we found that the differences between TPU and GPU training results are small. The results are provided in Table H. We see no big difference between bfloat16 and float32 training.\n\n(Q5). Confirmation on state-of-the-art verifiable training baseline:\n\nFor the verification of L infinity norm perturbations, the current best baselines in most settings are IBP (Gowal et al., 2018), except on CIFAR 2/255 where (Wong et al. 2018) is the best. CROWN-IBP can achieve better-verified accuracy than previous state-of-the-art works in all settings.\n\nWe thank the reviewer again and will be glad to discuss with the reviewer on any parts that are still unclear, or any additional concerns raised.\n", "title": "Thank you for the encouraging comments.
