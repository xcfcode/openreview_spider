A proof of concept on synthetic problems is presented. Finally, the empirical results on the solar wind modelling task improve on the state of the art in solar wind forecasting.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Time-Lag Regression", "Time Delay", "Regression", "Time Series"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper proposes a Bayesian approach for time-series regression when the explanatory time-series influences the response time-series with a time lag.

More precisely, for most problems in biology, ecology, meteorology, medicine and forestry, the time-lag (between the cause series and the effect series) follows a distribution which might be unknown, but is assumed to be stationary.\n\nThe Bayesian approach is very common, what is the highlighted content?\nIn other problems (e.g. natural language processing and translation), the correspondence between the input/cause series $x(i)$ and the output/effect series $y(i)$ is most often handled using bidirectional approaches or by exploiting the fact that input sentences and output sentences are mapped one-to-one. \nBidirectional approaches were not considered due to the intended usage of the model: one only sees the sequence up to now in order to predict the future. \nThe novelty of the proposed method can be seen by contrast with the vanilla alternative:\n* use the bidirectional approach for the training data, \n* infer independently the lag $\\hat{g}(\\mathbf{x}(t))$ and the effect $\\hat{y}(t + g(\\mathbf{x}(t))$\n* use vanilla regression on the two problems $x(t),\\ \\hat{g}(\\mathbf{x}(t))$ and $\\mathbf{x}(t), \\hat{y}(t + \\hat g(\\mathbf{x}(t)))$.\nThe problem with this vanilla option is that the errors on $\\hat{g}$ and $\\hat{y}$ will accumulate. \n\nOther issues: \n1- We use standard RMSE for both the synthetic and real problems, we thank the reviewer for pointing out this typo! \n2- the segmentation of the 2-5 days ranges into 12 segments; the more the number of segments, the more difficult it is for local models $\\hat{y}_i$ to be sufficiently diverse. Experimentally, the approach failed with 60 segments, and we did not investigate further the sensitivity of the approach to the size of $\\mathcal{T}$. \n3- the benefits of the saddle analysis: a clear benefit is to detect when the information in the data is insufficient, and can only lead to the trivial solution (predicting the average). Instead of proceeding by trial and error, we have a characterization of failure cases. In our experiments this is indicated by the value of $C_1$ (see table 1 at the end of the paper).

After providing extensive analysis for the alternating optimization of the parameters, the proposed model is tested in synthetic and real-world experiments, where it achieves state-of-the-art in solar wind prediction.\n\nThe approach of the paper to the problem is principled and it provides extensive theoretical and experimental results for further insight.

However, the paper proceeds to make a modeling assumption of the same sort which bounds the time lag. In light of this, I do think that transformer type models can be adapted to this setting, and in fact, an input dependent attention mechanism is ideal for combining the prediction of time-lag and the raw response in the output sequence.

It is a major threat to the modern world. Authors propose a new regression model called Dynamic Time-Lag Regression which is a special case for spatio-temporal data. For solving this regression problem, the authors use a standard Bayesian approach to fit the model. The analysis of saddle point in Section 3.2 is quite impressive and meaningful. Correspondingly, the practical DTLR algorithm iteratively updates the parameters and hyper-parameters. In experiments, it reveals that the proposed method improves the performance for this particular problem significantly.

The novelity of the problem posed is that the time lag g(x(t)) is allowed to be non-stationary and supposed to be unknown. The authors outlie a a Bayesian approach. The likelihood of the cause-effect data is conidered used to optimize the regressors for a given, finite set of time lags and the probability of these time lags. This discussion is very brief and detailled derivations are given in the appendix. An accompanying stability analysis is performed. In the implementation a neural network-based approach is used, where in turns the parameters of the model are optimised by a typical gradient descent algorithm and afterwards the hyperparemeters are set to values determined by the parameters. The theoretical deviation is accompanied by practical expirements on synthetically generated data and (real) space weather data. The performance of the model is compared to the one of a prediction with a fixed time lag, which it in fact outperforms. On the space weather (solar wind) data the model is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art models. A codebase for an implementation done in the Scala language is given.\n\nThe paper presented provides a meaningful contribution to the field of time series analysis and Bayesian methods.
