On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS can discover a novel architecture thats achieves a test perplexity of 57.8, which is state-of-the-art among automatic model design methods on Penn Treebank. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS can design novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, close to the 2.65% achieved by standard NAS (Zoph et al., 2017).

There was some vigorous discussion on the paper centering around the choices that were available to the conv-nets.  The author's strongly emphasized the improvements on the PTB task.\n\nFor my part, I think the method is very compelling -- sharing weights for all the models we are optimizing on seems like a great idea -- and that we can make it work is even more interesting. So from this point of view, I think its a novel contribution and worth accepting.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm likely to agree with some of the motivations behind the questions raised by R3. Are all the choices really necessary ? perhaps the gains came from just a couple of things like number of skip connections and channels, etc. That exploration is useful. On the flip side, I think it may be an irrelevant question -- the model is able to make the correct decisions from a big set.\n\nThe authors emphasize the language modelling part, but for me, this was actually less compelling. The authors use some of the tricks from Merity in their model training (perplexity 52.8), and as a result are already using some techniques that produces better results. Further, PTB is a regularization game -- and that's not really the claim of this paper. Although, one could argue that weight sharing between different models can produce an ensembling / regularization effect and those gains may show up on PTB. A much more compelling story would have been to show that this method works on a large dataset where the impact of the architecture cannot be conflated with controlling overfitting better.\n\nAs a result, this puts the paper on the fence for me; even though I very much like the idea. Polishing the paper and making a more convincing case for both the CNNs and RNNs will make this paper a solid contribution in the future."}, "review": {"BkrqNswgf": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ByQZjx-0-", "review": "In the paper titled \"Faster Discovery of Neural Architectures by Searching for Paths in a Large Model\", the authors proposed an efficient algorithm which can be used for efficient (less resources and time) and faster architecture design for neural networks.

Therefore we do not have any evidence that the LSTM controller has learnt any interesting rule regarding block type, or relation between block type width and layer index. All we see is that the model does not chose too many maps, thus avoid significant overfit. The relevant baseline here is a model with 64 or 96 maps on each block, each layer.Such a model is likely to do as well as the ENAS model, and can be obtained easily with slight parameter tuning of a single parameter.\n-\t Similarly, I\u2019m not convinced the  skip connection pattern found for Cifar-10 is superior to standard denseNet or Resnet pattern.

It seems to be limited to choosing a specific set of parameters in very specific scenario (scenario which enable parameter sharing between model. The conditions for this to happen seems to be rather strict, and where not elaborated).\n\nAfter revision:\nThe controller is now better presented.\nHowever, the main points were not changed:\n   - ENAS seems to be limited to a specific architecture and search space, in which probably the search is already exhausted. For example for the image processing network, it is determining the number of skip connections and structure of a single layer as a combination of several function types. We already know the answers to these search problems (denser skip connection pattern works better, more functions types  in a layer in parallel do better, the number of maps should be adjusted to the complexity and data size to avoid overfit). ENAS does not reveal a new surprising architectures, and it seems that instead of searching in the large space it suggests, one can just tune a 1-2 parameters  (for the image network, it is the number of maps in a layer).\n  - Results comparing ENAS results to the simple baseline of just tuning 1-2 hyper parameters were not shown. I hence believe the strong empirical results of ENAS are a property of the search space (the architecture used) and not of the search algorithm.", "title": "Nice idea, but the paper suffers from unclear presentation and the empirical results are not convincing enough.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "Bkj-7CYef": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ByQZjx-0-", "review": "In this paper, the authors look to improve Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which has been successfully applied to discovering successful neural network architectures, albeit requiring many computational resources. The authors propose a new approach they call Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), whose key insight is parameter sharing. In NAS, the practitioners have to retrain for every new architecture in the search process, but in ENAS this problem is avoided by sharing parameters and using discrete masks. In both approaches, reinforcement learning is used to  learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward of some validation set metric. Since we can encode a neural network as a sequence, the policy can be parameterized as an RNN where every step of the sequence corresponds to an architectural choice. In their experiments, ENAS achieves test set metrics that are almost as good as NAS, yet require significantly less computational resources and time.\n\nThe authors present two ENAS models: one for CNNs, and another for RNNs. Initially it seems like the controller can choose any of B operations in a fixed number of layers along with choosing to turn on or off ay pair of skip connections. However, in practice we see that the search space for modeling both skip connections and choosing convolutional sizes is too large, so the authors use only one restriction to reduce the size of the state space. This is a limitation, as the model space is not as flexible as one would desire in a discovery task. Moreover, their best results (and those they choose to report in the abstract) are due to fixing 4 parallel branches at every layer combined with a 1 x 1 convolution, and using ENAS to learn the skip connections. Thus, they are essentially learning the skip connections while using a human-selected model. \n\nENAS for RNNs is similar: while NAS searches for a new architecture, the authors use a recurrent highway network for each cell and use ENAS to find the skip connections. Thus, it seems like the term Efficient Neural Architecture Search promises too much since in both tasks they are essentially only using the controller to find skip connections. Although finding an appropriate architecture for skip connections is an important task, finding an efficient method to structure RNN cells seems like a significantly more important goal.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written, and it brings up an important idea: that parameter sharing is important for discovery tasks so we can avoid re-training for every new architecture in the search process. Moreover, using binary masks to control network path (essentially corresponding to training different models) is a neat idea. It is also impressive how much faster their model performs on tasks without sacrificing much performance. The main limitation is that the best architectures as currently described are less about discovery and more about human input -- finding a more efficient search path would be an important next step.", "title": "Improving Neural Architecture Search by Parameter Sharing", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"}, "BJI7WwsQz": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJE-zQ9mG", "comment": "The reviewer has many concerns, but we believe that the reviewer is not impressed by the search space, and the fact that the search space is not interesting. We have a result in the paper where we ran ENAS with a general search space, and search for both skip connection patterns and operations at each layer (Section 4.2, last paragraph of page 7). This search space is as general as the search space in the original NAS paper [1], and is 16M larger than the constrained search spaces. ENAS found a model that achieves 4.23% test error. This result is on par with one of the best human-designed architectures in 2016: WideResNet (4.17% test error).\n\nEven within the restricted search space over patterns skip connections, the patterns in the subspace only **look** similar. They have a wide range of accuracy: a randomly chosen pattern of skip connections has test error 5.11% (our previous comment); densenet pattern has test error 4.07%; the best pattern that ENAS finds has test error 3.87%. The relative improvement compared to the random baseline is (ENAS - densenet) / (ENAS - random) = 0.16, which is statistically significant.\n\nWe understand that the reviewer may not understand the significance of the new recurrent cells and 57.8 perplexity.

However, we are still unsatisfied with the current evaluation of our work, especially based on the remaining concerns that the reviewer has raised.  We have supporting evidence to completely address the concerns raised by the reviewer.\n\n*** Note that the paper has been updated with a new / much cleaner search space and better results on the PTB dataset. See Section 3.1 and 4.1. We achieved the perplexity of 57.8, much better than NAS\u2019s previous result of 62.4, and the recurrent cell that ENAS found cannot be obtained with hyper-parameters tuning. We suspect that the reviewer did not see these updates. We use these results in the comments below to address some concerns by the reviewer. We encourage the reviewer to take a look at these sections before reading the rebuttal below. \n\n1. The reviewer comments \u201cENAS seems to be limited to a specific architecture and search space, in which probably the search is already exhausted.\u201d\n\nWe argue that ENAS and NAS are fundamentally equivalent. Searching a path within a model and searching different operation per step are the same.\n\nWe disagree with this statement \u201cthe search is already exhausted\u201d. As presented in Section 3.1, the size of the search space for recurrent cells is about 8.03 \u00d7 10^15. ENAS has only seen 735,000 architectures, which is very far away from exhausting the search space (1 in 10^10). We are likewise only able to search for 759500 architectures of our convolutional search space, where the search space size is about 1.6 \u00d7 10^29.\n\n2. The reviewer comments \u201cFor example for the image processing network, it is determining the number of skip connections and structure of a single layer as a combination of several function types.\u201d\n\nThis observation is also not true. ENAS does not only find \u201cthe number of skip connections\u201d but also finds what are those skip connections. It is very clear from Figure 5-Right in our revision. There are 26 skip connections. If one is told that a network with 12 layers needs 26 skip connections, there are still (12C2)C26 = 1.65 \u00d7 10^18 possible choices.\n\n3. The reviewer comments \u201cWe already know the answers to these search problems (denser skip connection pattern works better,\u201d\n\nWe disagree with this intuition and we have the evidence to support our disagreement. Denser skip connection patterns require more parameters (for conv 1x1), which may lead to overfitting. Indeed, we did a controlled experiment, and the DenseNet pattern (connecting every pair of layers) achieves 5.23% test error, which is worse than the pattern of skip connections found by ENAS. (Note: we have mentioned this in our first round of rebuttal comments)\n\n4. The reviewer comments \u201cENAS does not reveal a new surprising architectures, and it seems that instead of searching in the large space it suggests, one can just tune a 1-2 parameters (for the image network, it is the number of maps in a layer). ... Results comparing ENAS results to the simple baseline of just tuning 1-2 hyper parameters were not shown.\u201d\n\nThe reviewer is concerned that ENAS didn\u2019t find any surprising architectures. We disagree and argue that the recurrent cell is surprising and cannot easily designed manually  (Figure 4 in our revision). It is subjective but one can also argue that the architectures on CIFAR-10 aren\u2019t obvious. \n\nIn terms of hyperparameter tuning vs architecture search, we have the following pieces of evidence:\n\nFirst, we tuned the number of maps at each layer of the DenseNet pattern (64, 128, and 256). The best test error we could get was 4.07%. Second, we randomly sampled a pattern of skip connections, and then tuned the number of maps at each layer (we tried 48, 64, 128, 256, and 512). The lowest test error we could get by doing so is 5.11%. Both of these test errors are worse than the 3.87% obtained by ENAS. We\u2019re happy to add these results to the paper.\n\nThirdly, Melis et al (2017) [1] has performed extensive tuning of an LSTM network. Zoph and Le (2017) also reported to have done a grid search over hyper-parameters. Both of them used intensive computing resources to tune way more than 1-2 hyper-parameters, and yet neither achieved a performance as good as our ENAS recurrent cell (58.9 and 62.4 perplexity, compared to 57.8 by ENAS), and we haven\u2019t tuned any hyper-parameters! It is thus clear that hyper-parameters tuning will not lead to comparable performance with ENAS, at least not without a good model. \n\n[to be continued]", "title": "Let's discuss your remaining concerns!"}, "rkMLW6K7z": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Sksb-TtQM", "comment": "5.

To address this concern, we have completely rewritten the paper. Please see our most recent revision for the changes. We did so with two main goals:\n\n1. Make the presentation of ENAS easier to follow. We tried to present examples of how ENAS and its controller work (Section 3 in our revision), and moved the detailed implementations to our Experiments and Appendix. We will eventually release our implementation of ENAS to clear all ambiguities for readers who wish to replicate our method.\n\n2. Present new experimental results. We conducted experiments on other search spaces, as suggested by the comments of AnonReviewer2 and AnonReviewer3. With these experiments, we hope to show that ENAS is a general method, and that ENAS can discover good models with minimal human inputs (Section 4 in our revision). For details, please see our revision as well as the comments delivered to each reviewer.\n\nWe were dismayed by the low scores that we received. Not only does ENAS speed up NAS by an order of magnitude, but in our revision, ENAS also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Penn Treebank among automatic model design approaches (57.8 perplexity, without extensive hyper-parameters tuning). Other ICLR 2018 submissions, e.g., Paper 1 and Paper 323, also try to address the expensive use of time and computing resource by NAS approaches. They have worse empirical results than ENAS, and yet receive better scores. We thus hope that the reviewers will reconsider their judgement of our work.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Paper 1: SMASH: One-Shot Model Architecture Search through HyperNetworks (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rydeCEhs-)\n[2] Paper 323: A Flexible Approach to Automated RNN Architecture Generation (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkOb1Fl0Z)", "title": "Revision and General rebuttal"}, "BJREcLfXM": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkrqNswgf", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their review. To address reviewers\u2019 concerns, we have completely rewritten the paper to make it easier to follow and we have also included new experimental results (all reported in our revision). We sincerely hope that the reviewer will update positively on our revised paper. We believe that ENAS delivers extremely non-trivial contributions to architecture search approaches. \n\nFirst, while the idea of ENAS is simple - sharing parameters between architectures so that they don\u2019t need to be trained again - we believe that this idea is far from incremental. A lot of details are needed to share the parameters appropriately, e.g. the design choice of representing all child models in a large graph (see Sections 3 and 4 in our revision for more details). ENAS leads to two orders of magnitude reduction of computing resource and an order of magnitude reduction of time consumed, all without sacrificing much performance.\n\nSecond, in our revision, we showed that ENAS actually achieves a better perplexity than NAS on Penn Treebank. We designed a different search space, in which ENAS found a recurrent cell that achieves 57.8 perplexity on Penn Treebank (compared to NAS\u2019s 62.4 perplexity), and establishes the state-of-the-art performance on automatic model design on Penn Treebank. Furthermore, this result is also achieved without extensive hyper-parameters tuning (Melis et al., 2017). Details are in Section 4.1 of our revision.\n\nFinally, we find that among other submissions to ICLR 2018, some papers address the similar problem with ENAS: the computational expense of automatic model designing approaches. For example SMASH [1] is a method that automatically designs networks for image classification tasks. As of now, despite the fact that SMASH performs worse than ENAS and was only applied to images and not texts, their paper has a much better score than ours (SMASH has an averaged score of 6 while our paper got an averaged score of 5). We sincerely hope that you will give ENAS another consideration.\n\n[1] Paper 1: SMASH: One-Shot Model Architecture Search through HyperNetworks (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rydeCEhs-)\n", "title": "Rebuttal for AnonReviewer1"}, "H1wfqUMXf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HkAyq8MQf", "comment": "While we hope that our revision will improve your overall understanding of the paper, we will answer your specific questions below:\n\nPage 3: \u201cfor each channel, we only predict C/S binary masks\u201d   -> this seems to be a mistake.

We designed a different search space for recurrent cells, in which ENAS finds a novel recurrent cell that achieves 57.8 test perplexity on Penn Treebank. We have reported this new result in our revision (Sections 4.1 and 5.1). Let\u2019s call this the ENASCell. \n\nENASCell is very novel compared to the recurrent highway network (see Figure 4 in our revision). While the search space for ENASCell still uses highway connections, the ENAS controller has discovered several novelties:\n- the use of the ReLU activation, unlike in recurrent highway network where only the tanh activation is used\n- the pattern of connections within the ENASCell\nWe have also mentioned in the revision that ENASCell is, in a sense, a local optimum. If we slightly vary its components, its performance drops. This means that ENASCell is not trivial to find, affirming the role of ENAS.\n\nAdditionally, to our knowledge, ENASCell\u2019s perplexity of 57.8 is the state-of-the-art among automatic model design approaches on Penn Treebank. It outperforms NAS (62.4 perplexity), which uses two orders of magnitude more computations and way more time. ENASCell, with almost no hyper-parameter tuning, also outperforms LSTM with extensive hyper-parameters tuning (59.5 perplexity) (Melis et al., 2017).\n\nBased on these results, we believe that it is clear that: 1) ENAS a crucial component to our design of novel architectures that achieves good performances and 2) ENAS is a general method: whenever a search space is specified, ENAS is applicable. ENAS\u2019s performance indeed depends on the search space, but this is also the case with other NAS methods.\n\nFinally, we can compare ENAS to other ICLR 2018 submissions that address the computational expense of automatic model designing approaches. SMASH [1] is a method that automatically designs networks for image classification tasks. As of now, despite the fact that SMASH performs worse than ENAS and was only applied to images and not texts, their paper has an average score of 6 while our paper received an averaged score of 5. \n\nWe believe that ENAS delivers significant contributions to automatic model designing, and that ENAS has compelling advantages compared to hyperparameter tuning, especially in its ability to achieve good performances with a low usage of computing resource and time. We sincerely hope that you will give ENAS a reconsideration.\n\n[1] Paper 1: SMASH: One-Shot Model Architecture Search through HyperNetworks (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rydeCEhs-)\n----------------------------------------\n", "title": "Rebuttal for AnonReviewer3 (continued 1)"}, "HkpjFLfQM": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJaD7VugM", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. We were very dismayed by the low score. Subsequently, we have completely rewritten the paper to make it easier to follow .We have also included new experimental results to address the reviewer\u2019s concerns. All the results are reported in our revision. We hope that our revisions of the paper can clear the reviewer\u2019s reservation about ENAS\u2019s ability.\n\nIn the following, we try to address the reviewer\u2019s concerns.\n\nFirst, we have completely rewritten the paper for clarity. We focused on delivering the high level ideas, and we moved a lot of implementation details into our appendix. To address the reviewer\u2019s particular comment about the lack of details on the controller, we refer the reviewer to Section 3 in our revision.\n\nAs evidenced by the anonymous comment above, our previous presentation is sufficient for independent researchers to to implement our method. Therefore, we believe that our revision, which aims to improve the original presentation, does not obscure ENAS\u2019s details. After the reviewing cycle, we will also publish our code, which we hope will clear any ambiguity about ENAS.\n\nSecond, in our revision, we have included new experimental results to address the reviewer\u2019s concerns that ENAS is not general, and whether ENAS is responsible for the good results. We summarize them below:\n\n1) ENAS is indeed responsible for the results. This information was in our original submission. In our revision, it is highlighted in the paragraph \u201cSanity Check and Ablation Study\u201d at the beginning Section 4.3. In particular, a model randomly sampled from our search space does not perform as well as a model sampled by the ENAS controller. Also, we if train ENAS without training its controller, performance is much worse. Both observations, as presented in the paper, indicate the importance of ENAS.\n\nTo further address the reviewer\u2019s concerns, we have conducted more controlled experiments. Following are their results:\n\n1a) 64 or 96 maps on CIFAR-10 models. Sure, a model with randomly chosen 64 or 96 maps on each block, each layer may perform similarly to ENAS. However, in this search space, the controller can take up to 256 maps. Without ENAS, a random model designer would select roughly 128 maps at each block, each layer. If you haven\u2019t seen ENAS\u2019s decisions to pick 64 or 96 maps, would you think of such a baseline? We do agree that a slight tune of hyper-parameters may also lead to this model. However, in other search spaces (e.g. see Section 4.2 in our revision), where one needs to figure out the skip connections, the tuning of hyper-parameters won\u2019t be as \u201cslight\u201d.\n\n1b) The pattern of skip connections found by ENAS is indeed better than the DenseNet pattern and the ResNet pattern. In our settings, the DenseNet pattern (connecting every pair of layers) achieves 5.23% test error, and the ResNet pattern (connecting each layer to the next) achieves 6.01% test error. We also note that the DenseNet and the ResNet patterns in our settings are not the DenseNet and ResNet in their original papers. The reason for the differences lies in the design choice of our search spaces: we make skip connections go through a conv1x1 instead of concatenation as in the original DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016), or identity and addition as in the original ResNet (He et al., 2015). Such design choice may be sub-optimal, and we will try the identity skip connections in our next revision. However, our controlled experiment does show that in our search space, the skip connections that ENAS finds do achieve non-trivial improvements compared to standard patterns.\n\n2) ENAS is a general method. To see this, note that one way to do programming is to search for a path in a bigger program, where all operations are available at every step. In ENAS, the computations in a neural architecture can be viewed as a program, which is represented as directed acyclic graph (DAG) (see Section 1 of our revision). To apply ENAS to any task, e.g. designing a convolutional network, or designing a recurrent cell, one only needs to specify the DAG\u2019s components (examples are now in Section 3 of our revision).\n\n3) We further elaborate point 2) above by applying ENAS to different search spaces. First, we use ENAS to search for both skip connections and layer operations (convolutions with different filter sizes, or average pooling, or max pooling). It turns out that in this search space, ENAS could discover a model with CIFAR-10 test error of 4.23%. This resulting model is comparable to the model found in the restricted search space over convolutions and pooling masks. Therefore, ENAS works in this search space.\n\n[to be continued]", "title": "Rebuttal for AnonReviewer3"}, "ryc0uUz7M": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Bkj-7CYef", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. We were very dismayed by the low score. Subsequently, we have completely rewritten the paper to make it easier to follow. We have also included new experimental results to address the reviewer\u2019s concerns. All the results are reported in our revision and are summarized below. We hope that our revisions of the paper can clear the reviewer\u2019s reservation about ENAS\u2019s ability.\n\nSummary of New Results: \n\n1) The reviewer is concerned that ENAS can only search small search spaces. This is not the case. We used ENAS to search for both skip connections and layer operations (convolutions with different filter sizes, or average pooling, or max pooling). It turns out that in this large search space, ENAS could also discover a model with CIFAR-10 test error of 4.23%. This resulting model is comparable to the model found in the restricted search space over convolutions and pooling masks. Therefore, search space size is not a limitation of ENAS.\n\n2) The reviewer is concerned that the best ENAS model is \u201cless about discovery and more about human input.\u201d We show that ENAS can do well with less human inputs. In particular, we took the pattern of skip connections discovered by ENAS (Figure 5-Right in our revision), and simply increased the number of output channels at each layer from 256 to 512. The resulting model achieves 3.87% test error on CIFAR-10. In the original paper, the best ENAS result on CIFAR-10 is 3.86% test error, achieved by using multiple branches at each layer. Therefore, we showed that the model found by ENAS, with minimal human inputs, can achieve a similar performance to models that are designed with more human inputs.\n\nWe note that ENAS\u2019s principle, i.e. searching for a path in a big model is general. Under this principle, we can do whatever other NAS approaches can do. We also note that the human input of increasing the number of output channels was also performed by the original NAS paper (Zoph and Le, 2017).\n\n3) We designed a different search space for recurrent cells. In this search space, ENAS finds a novel recurrent cell that achieves 57.8 test perplexity on Penn Treebank. We have reported this new result in our revision (Sections 4.1 and 5.1). Let\u2019s call this the ENASCell. ENASCell is very novel compared to recurrent highway network (see Figure 4 in our revision). While the search space for ENASCell still benefits from highway connections, the ENAS controller has discovered several novelties:\n- the use of the ReLU activation, unlike in recurrent highway network where only the tanh activation is used\n- the pattern of connections within the ENASCell\nTo our knowledge, ENASCell\u2019s perplexity of 57.8 is the state-of-the-art among automatic model design approaches on Penn Treebank. ENASCell outperforms NAS (62.4 perplexity), which uses two orders of magnitude more computations and one order of magnitude more time. ENASCell, with almost no hyper-parameters tuning, also outperformed LSTM with extensive hyper-parameters tuning (59.5 perplexity) (Melis et al., 2017).\n\nWe now compare ENAS to other ICLR 2018 submissions which address similar problems, i.e. computationally inexpensive approaches for automatic model designing. In particular, Paper 1 presents SMASH, a method that automatically designs networks for image classification tasks, and Paper 323 presents a method that automatically designs recurrent cells. As of now, despite the fact that their methods perform worse than ENAS, both papers receive at least one 7 in their reviews.\n\nWe believe that ENAS\u2019s contributions are significant, both in the novelty of its idea and in the significance of its results. We sincerely hope that you will give ENAS another consideration.\n\n\n[1] Paper 1: SMASH: One-Shot Model Architecture Search through HyperNetworks (https://openreview.net/forum?id=rydeCEhs-)\n[2] Paper 323: A Flexible Approach to Automated RNN Architecture Generation (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkOb1Fl0Z)\n", "title": "Rebuttal for AnonReviewer2"}, "BJi-csZgM": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJpVtZbgG", "comment": "Thanks for the question.\n\nThe input to each time step of the controller RNN at time step t is the embedding of the decision sampled from time step t-1.
