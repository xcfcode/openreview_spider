", "abstract": "We introduce Active Tuning, a novel paradigm for optimizing the internal dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on the fly. In contrast to the conventional sequence-to-sequence mapping scheme, Active Tuning decouples the RNN's recurrent neural activities from the input stream, using the unfolding temporal gradient signal to tune the internal dynamics into the data stream. As a consequence, the model output depends only on its internal hidden dynamics and the closed-loop feedback of its own predictions; its hidden state is continuously adapted by means of the temporal gradient resulting from backpropagating the discrepancy between the signal observations and the model outputs through time. In this way, Active Tuning infers the signal actively but indirectly based on the originally learned temporal patterns, fitting the most plausible hidden state sequence into the observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Active Tuning on several time series prediction benchmarks, including multiple super-imposed sine waves, a chaotic double pendulum, and spatiotemporal wave dynamics. Active Tuning consistently improves the robustness, accuracy, and generalization abilities of all evaluated models. Moreover, networks trained for signal prediction and denoising can be successfully applied to a much larger range of noise conditions with the help of Active Tuning. Thus, given a capable time series predictor, Active Tuning enhances its online signal filtering, denoising, and reconstruction abilities without the need for additional training.", "keywords": ["Signal Filtering", "Recurrent Neural Network", "Time Series", "Denoising", "Temporal Gradients"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper introduces a method to estimate dynamics parameters in recurrent structured models during the learning process.

Please note that we applied DISTANA only for predicting the Wave Dynamics. In the other two problem cases, standard LSTMs were applied, underlining the general applicability of Active Tuning. \n\n- Yes, we clearly see your demand for an algorithmic description as justified. We added Algorithm 1 including some further explanations in the text and hope this complements the method section satisfactorily.\n- We are not entirely sure about what you mean with bias concerning the data generation. But, of course, we tried to produced datasets that were as unbiased as possible, randomizing the parameters of the generation process accordingly. \n- We actually did vary the tuning length and tuning cycles across the three different problem domains and noise levels (albeit not very much). The particular choices can be found in Table 6, 7, and 8 in Section A.2 of the appendix.

Hence, we incorporated an experiment with a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model, namely, a temporal convolution network (TCN). Indeed, as reported in the modified Table 4 (and Table 5 in the appendix) of our revised paper, we can verify your expectations and have consistently observed that the TCN is outperformed by Active Tuning. However, we would like to again highlight the fact that we did not aim at beating the most sophisticated state-of-the-art ANN in particular domains. Rather, Active Tuning has the potential to generally enhance the performance of prediction models, and particularly recurrent temporal prediction models, without further training when facing missing values and noisy data.\n- \"Same comparisons might be interesting for tuning weights instead of hidden states.\". This is clearly a very interesting idea, which we hope to elaborate on in future work. What we investigated so far is tuning the cell states, the \"hidden states\" (unit outputs), and even the signal itself. What we found is that it did not really make a huge difference, which of the mentioned parts are optimized. Typically, tuning just the hidden units outputs works best, but only with a small margin (at least for LSTMs). When tuning the weights catastrophic forgetting might become an issue, which Active Tuning fully avoids, because the model parameters (i.e. the ANN weights) are not modified.

Instead, the hidden states of pre-trained models are optimized based on the prediction error-induced gradient information. The outputs of the RNNs are thus only driven by the continuously applied gradient-based tuning of the hidden states. Sorry, if we did not make this clear enough. We hope that with inclusion of Algorithm 1 this becomes more comprehensible.\n\n- To the best of our knowledge, there are no comparable approaches to exclusively tune the RNN's hidden states for inference purposes. The main statement that we tried to make with our paper is, however, that Active Tuning can dramatically improve an already existing model (without additional learning) and unfold robustness properties that have not been addressed during training. In order to further interpret the potential of the method, we incorporated results of temporal convolution networks (see updated Table 4 in subsection 4.3. as well as the new Table 5 in the appendix).\n- We appreciate and agree on your point that we exclusively focused on noise filtering and noise robustness. To underline the potential of Active Tuning further, we now performed an additional experiment to demonstrate superior robustness to missing values in time series data when using Active Tuning (see Table 2 of the revised paper). \n- Indeed, the potential computational overhead of using Active Tuning can not be neglected. Yet, this overhead, caused by a gradient-based mini optimization procedure within every global time step, scales with the number of tuning cycles C and tuning horizon R (both essentially depend on the problem, as can be seen in the Tables 6, 7 and 8 of the appendix). We are currently working on reducing the required numbers of C and R, which would significantly reduce the computational overhead. Nevertheless, since we admit the importance of this aspect, we have added a corresponding amendment to Section 2.", "title": "Response to Reviewer 1"}, "bSSV8bTbu-n": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Ao2-JgYxuQf", "comment": "Thank you to all three reviewers for insightful comments, the criticism, and the suggestions.

This paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed active tuning scheme. I read the paper carefully multiple times, and feel that a few inclusions will help the readers better understand the proposed method.\n\nAt the base level, this paper builds on optimizing the internal dynamics of a recurrent neural network unlike optimizing internal weights in traditional sequence-to-sequence mapping. This is achieved by decoupling the recurrent neural activities from the input temporal signal and propagating the error (the difference between the estimated input value and the observed input value of the input signal) to tune the internal dynamics of the network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of active tuning the authors trained a distributed graph recurrent neural network (DISTANA) on three datasets with increasing complexity. Datasets included: multiple super-imposed sine waves, a chaotic double pendulum, and spatiotemporal wave dynamics.  On average ten independent experiments were performed and the effectiveness of active tuning was evaluated using root mean square (RMS).  Samples for the experiments were generated using five different noise ratios between 0 and 1 to measure the effectiveness of the proposed method for noisy data scenarios. The network was also trained on no noise to 0.05 noise induced into training data to see if it would help the models better generalize. The results as depicted in graphs show that active tuning is not only robust but generalizes well on noisy data. \n\nRecommendations:\n1. The active Tuning algorithm itself is missing from this paper. Even though the explanation is clear, it would help the readers to see the algorithm itself for better understanding. The reviewer referred to Hidden Latent State Inference in a Spatio-Temporal Generative by karlbauer et. al. 2020 (arXiv:2009.09823) for the algorithm. \n\n2. The authors confirm that 10000 and 1000 samples have been generated for all the problem domains tested. However, it is not clear if steps were in place to make sure that no bias was introduced during this sample generation. \n\n3. While the tuning length and tuning cycles were fixed for all three datasets, it is important to see how these values can be optimized based on the complexity of the time series data. Experimental results using a range of values for tunning length and tuning cycles would be beneficial.", "title": "An interesting approach in optimizing the internal dynamics of recurrent neural networks", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "fhawELqBPqq": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Ao2-JgYxuQf", "review": "Paper proposes a way to adapt an autoregressive model (RNN in examples) to the incoming noisy signal to generate noise-free data output.

The idea sounds interesting, however the lack of comparisons with other approaches and theoretical justification of why this approach is superior makes it hard to convince reader. \n\nQuality: Paper is well written and most of the concepts is clear. However, paper will benefit from a better explanation of the method, simpler diagram and equations to remove uncertainty on implementation. \n\nOriginality: I believe the idea is novel and interesting for community.
