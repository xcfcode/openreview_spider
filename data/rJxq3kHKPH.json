Most importantly, the updated paper demonstrates the three-stage phenomenon on Open Images and adds experiments on IMDB showing that the Gambler's loss with AES helps a lot. The LAES iteration introduced in the updated paper alleviates my concern about performance drop compared to the CT baseline at certain corruptions on CIFAR-10.\n\nThe bad:\n- From Figure 12, it looks like the three-stage phenomenon doesn't hold on IMDB. Does AES provide additional benefit beyond the Gambler's loss on IMDB? This needs to be clarified with the way Figure 12 turned out.\n- There is a serious missing citation [1] that should be included as a baseline. The proposed method in [1] is at least superficially similar to the Gambler's loss and also makes use of the fact that it is easier to fit clean labels than noisy labels. My apologies for not noticing this earlier.\n\nOverall:\nI would still suggest acceptance, because the three-stage phenomenon is an interesting find that the authors make good use of. In light of the missing citation, though, I cannot raise my score.\n\n\n[1]: Zhilu Zhang, Mert R. Sabuncu. \"Generalized Cross Entropy Loss for Training Deep Neural Networks with Noisy Labels\". NeurIPS 2018.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary:\nThis paper proposes a method to alleviate label noise. It opens with the observation of three distinct stages when training in the presence of label noise. Importantly, there is a \u2018gap\u2019 stage during which the network has not begun memorizing noisy labels and early stopping is ideal. The authors then observe that the Gambler\u2019s loss (Ziyin et al., 2019) elongates the gap stage and propose an analytic early stopping (AES) criterion for identifying when to stop training.\n\nThe analysis of the AES criterion, e.g. in Figure 5, and the observation of a phase transition when tuning the o hyperparameter are quite interesting, and the latter observation is of practical value when using the AES criterion.\n\nThe AES criterion seems to be well-motivated, and the empirical evaluation of the Gambler\u2019s loss with and without early stopping is good. The results are strong on MNIST but somewhat weak on CIFAR-10. Specifically, the improvements on CIFAR-10 only appear for large corruption rates (0.7+), and performance is lower than the baselines for other corruption rates. This is a worrying problem, because it calls into question the value of the method on larger problems. However, seeing as this is a distinct approach from the baselines and that it demonstrates some promise, I recommend borderline accept. The authors could raise my score by demonstrating more consistent gains on another larger-than-MNIST CV dataset or an NLP/speech dataset. Other points of concern that I have are listed below.\n\nMajor points:\nAt the top of page 3, the authors say that the idealized gap assumption \u201cholds well for simple datasets such as MNIST and on datasets with very high corruption rate, where our method achieves best results, and less so on more complicated datasets such as CIFAR10\u201d. The idealized gap assumption is behind the AES criterion, but Figure 5 suggests that the AES criterion works well on CIFAR-10, so what do the authors mean when they say the assumption doesn\u2019t work as well on CIFAR-10? Is this just referring to the results?\n\nSaying traditional label noise correction methods are \u201cof no use when one is not aware of the existence of label noise\u201d seems unfair. The FC method and others do not require foreknowledge of the corruption rate and do not harm performance in the absence of label noise, so they can also be said to automatically correct label noise.\n\n\u201cFC, however, requires knowing the whole transition matrix, and is outperformed significantly by our method.\u201d\nThis is not quite true, because Patrini et al. propose an estimate of the transition matrix as part of the Forward correction. Did you use the estimated or true transition matrix for the FC method? It would be good to clarify this in the paper.\n\nMinor points:\nThere are a few grammatical errors and typos in the paper:\n\n\u201cor explicit regularization, this is also what is suggested by Abiodun et al.

I feel the latest version of the paper is better than the previous version. \nHowever, as stated by other reviewers as well, the claims of the paper are quite ambiguous. Another example from the author response is the point about how Chapter 6 of the Elements of Infomation Theory is related to Gambler's loss. This is not clear to me. I would not object to accepting the paper but I find it difficult to recommend accept for this paper. Perhaps the authors can be more clear in their claims. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary: The paper focusses on the problem of noisy labels in supervised learning with deep neural networks. The paper, in turn, proposes an early stopping criterion for handling label noise. The early stopping criterion is dependent on a new loss function that is defined as the log of true label + weight on a reservation option? The paper shows that when the labels are corrupted then the propose early stopping criterion does better than early stopping criteria obtained via the validation set. \n\n\\The first section of the paper establishes that when label noise is present in the dataset, then there are three stages to training a deep neural network. \nThe learning stage where the highest accuracy on the test set is achieved. \nThe gap stage where test set accuracy goes down. \nMemorization stage corresponds to when a deep neural network memorizes corrupt labels and test accuracy goes completely down. \nI cannot understand figure 1(a). The y-label says accuracy but it seems that the plot is about loss. What dataset was this and what architecture of DNN was used? The plot shows that the DNN achieved a 100% accuracy in 5 epochs. Is this result meaningful? Before establishing a hypothesis based on this should the hypothesis not be tested on multiple datasets.\nThe paper says that these stages are persistent across multiple architectures and datasets and as proof the paper says \u2018we verified that\u2019. Why can\u2019t the reader see the experiments? By across datasets does the paper mean MNIST and CIFAR? By across architecture does the paper mean the two architectures mentioned in the appendix one each for MNIST and CIFAR respectively? \n\nThe paper makes the assumption that label noise is symmetrically corrupted. Why and where does such an assumption hold? What happens to the proposed method if that is not true. \n\nAssumption 2: During the gap stage the model has learned nothing about the corrupt data points. \nHow is that even possible? \n\nEquation 1: So the loss function proposed is log(f(x)_y + (1/o) f(x)_m+1) .  What is y here? The true label? Why is y called a point mass? Is this different from the cross-entropy loss + log loss on m+1 ?\n\nI do not understand equations 2 to 5. \n\nFor figure 3 again what datasets were used?\n\n\u201c Making random bet will help with making money and a skilled gambler will not make such bets\u201d \nWhy does making random bet help with making money? If random is good how can a skilled gambler exist in such a game? What is this skill?\n\nk denotes the sum of probability of predicting anything that is not y or m+1 (it does not denote prediction). \n\nIn the experiments section what was the symbol for the rate of corruption changed from epsilon to r. Are they different? \n \nWhat is nll? \n\nIt seems that gamblers loss best shines when the corruption rate is as high as 80% . That is 80 percent of the data is corrupted. Does this mean that if I trained with only 20% of the non-corrupt data I would still get a 99% accuracy on MNIST (even without gamblers loss)? A comparison of this sort would have been useful.  \nOne astonishing result the paper presents is that with gambler\u2019s loss even with 80% corrupt labels a 94% test accuracy is possible on MNIST dataset. I think this is significant, this raises the question that is it required to label all the data points ina dataset to achieve high accuracy or is it possible to achieve just as much with only 20% of the labels?", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 2}, "Skl4y3ytoB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJleZsO2KB", "comment": "Hi!

Is this just referring to the results?\u2019 \n- Sorry for this confusion! The same problem was also pointed to by reviewer 3. We removed this ambiguous sentence and added an example for this. It relates to the fact that on complicated dataset such as CIFAR10, the training accuracy on the clean dataset might be actually significant below 100%. While for MNIST, the training accuracy on the clean part is very close to 100%.\n\nA3. \u2018Saying traditional label noise correction methods are \u201cof no use when one is not aware of the existence of label noise\u201d seems unfair. The FC method and others do not require foreknowledge of the corruption rate and do not harm performance in the absence of label noise, so they can also be said to automatically correct label noise.\u2019\n- Yes, it is true that other methods, such as FC, when used without label noise, can be seen as a simple label smoothing method and should not harm learning. What we really meant was the cases in which the noise rate might be small (say, r=0.02-0.08) and might be hard to estimate, and in these case, other methods are unlikely to provide improvement when r is unknown. However, using the gambler\u2019s loss with some benign value of o is observed to actually improve the performance of the model (compared to training with nll loss). For example see section M (where o is set to 1.9 without any tuning).\n\nA4. \u2018\u201cFC, however, requires knowing the whole transition matrix, and is outperformed significantly by our method.\u201dThis is not quite true, because Patrini et al. propose an estimate of the transition matrix as part of the Forward correction. Did you use the estimated or true transition matrix for the FC method? It would be good to clarify this in the paper.\u2019\n- Yes, we used the estimation method proposed in the original paper, as we described in the related works section. When the transition matrix is exactly known, the Forward correction method can actually be quite strong (or even the best method).\n\nA5.

Saying that y is a point mass simply means that it is a 0-1 loss (having value 1 for the correct label, and having 0 for the incorrect labels). The loss function function indeed takes the form log(f(x)_y + (1/o) f(x)_m+1), this has well studied information-theoretic properties (see chapter 6 of [1] for a detailed discussion on its intuitive meaning and mathematical properties).

Before adding in experiments or rewriting sections, let me answer the questions that we can already provide answer to. We will let you know once we update the experiment section.\n\nA1. 'I cannot understand figure 1(a). The y-label says accuracy but it seems that the plot is about loss.'\n-For figure 1a, please note that figure 1a has two y-axes; on the left it says accuracy, and on the right it says loss, also, please note that we consistently we used this 2-axes style in the paper (e.g. Fig.3, Fig.5, Fig.6).\n\nA2. 'What dataset was this and what architecture of DNN was used?'\n-As is described in the title of Figure 1. This plot is for MNIST with corruption rate 0.5. Since the dataset is MNIST, the architecture is the one described in Table 3 in the appendix.\n\nA3. 'The plot shows that the DNN achieved a 100% accuracy in 5 epochs. Is this result meaningful?'\n-Hmmm, it is a little hard to answer this question without a clear definition of 'meaningful'. The dataset is MNIST, and usually the accuracy reaches >95% using a DNN without label noise.\n\nA4. 'Before establishing a hypothesis based on this should the hypothesis not be tested on multiple datasets.The paper says that these stages are persistent across multiple architectures and datasets and as proof the paper says \u2018we verified that\u2019. Why can\u2019t the reader see the experiments? By across datasets does the paper mean MNIST and CIFAR? By across architecture does the paper mean the two architectures mentioned in the appendix one each for MNIST and CIFAR respectively? '\n-In addition to the two CNN architectures we described in the paper, two experiments are done using ResNet18 (please see Figure 5.c and 5.d, and search for the word ResNet). In fact, this 3-stage phenomenon is quite easily observable for many datasets when decent level of label noise is present.

'The paper makes the assumption that label noise is symmetrically corrupted. Why and where does such an assumption hold? What happens to the proposed method if that is not true. '\n- Since the criterion does not apply to assymetrically corrupted data, to deal with asymmetrically corrupted data, some other criterion is needed. However, simply using gambler's loss in this case should also improve the final performance. We can also update some toy experiment on this if time allows by the time the rebuttal period ends.\n\nA6. 'Assumption 2: During the gap stage the model has learned nothing about the corrupt data points. How is that even possible? '\n- Empirically, the situation is that, on average, the model makes random prediction on the corrupted dataset. So there might be some corrupt points that the model actual learned, but the number of such points should be small compared to the ones the model has not learned. Moreover, this assumption can be verified by Figure 1, where the training loss on the corrupt part does not start to decrease significantly until 20th epoch, where learning of the clean data is very low. Theoretically speaking, this is because gradient descent tends to learn function of increasing complexity, and the corrupt labels constitute a very high complexity function, and so is very hard to learn compared with clean points [2]. \n\n", "title": "Reply (part 1)"}, "HkghJo9-jS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HJleZsO2KB", "comment": "Hi!

This is not clear and maybe not true.\n- Yes, this is indeed an intuitive assumption, and might not hold for some special cases, since zero gradient means no learning has occurred.

The actual mechanism might be very complicated and task-dependent, and a precise theoretical study of this phenomenon is extremely difficult given our current knowledge about deep learning theory. We added more intuition to this section, and we think that a clear theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is way beyond the scope of this work.\n\nA4. 'Many claims are very ambiguous.

It relates to the fact that on complicated dataset such as CIFAR10, the training accuracy on the clean dataset might be actually significant below 100%.\n\nA5.  'In some cases, it even leads to a better memorization phenomenon\", in which cases and why lead to better memorization phenomenon?'\n- There is no such sentence in our paper. In fact, we think this is a misreading of the two neighboring sentences in section 2:\n\"As a result, this widens the test accuracy plateau by slowing down the memorization phenomenon. In some cases, it even leads to a better convergence speed and better peak performance (see Figure 4). \"\n\nA6. 'Some claims are even wrong. For example, \"Traditional methods in label noise often involves introducing a surrogate loss function that is specialized for the corrupted dataset at hand and is of no use when one is not aware of the existence of label noise\" This is just for some specific methods, not for the most of them.'\n- Hmmm, thanks for pointing this out. Actually, what we really meant was that 'one common approach amongst others is to introduce a surrogate loss function', since the context was to introduce another loss function approach to the field. We have corrected this sentence.\n\nA7. We have also fixed the typo you mentioned.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for the review, and please check the newly revised section 2 and section A B in the appendix for your questions. Please let us know if you have more questions regarding section 2, and we will do our best to make it as clear as possible. \n\n", "title": "Reply"}, "ryxCkugxjr": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkxvUxMA5H", "comment": "Hi Yilun! Thanks for your comment and for noticing our work! The paper you pointed us to is indeed interesting, and using determinant of the estimated joint matrix is very novel and seems to work very well (I personally learned a lot from reading your paper). We were not aware of this paper before and we think it is good for us to relate to this work in our paper. However, we decided that we will refrain from making a comparison with this method for the following two reasons: (1) let C denote the number of classes, then computing the determinant of the joint matrix is of O(C^3) complexity (e.g., for the numpy implementation), for tasks such as CIFAR100 or ImageNet, it does not look like the method will scale up easily, this is then followed by a matrix inversion, which is again of Omega(C^2.3) complexity; (2) the loss function also seems to have non-trivial batchsize dependence in order to make the estimated joint matrix full rank, for Imagenet, for example, this method needs at least 1000 batchsize, and to ensure that the matrix is full rank with high probability, the batchsize seems to need to be another order of magnitude larger. In short, we really want to compare with methods with similar computational complexity, and we will relate to this work in the paper.
