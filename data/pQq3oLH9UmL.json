We hope that our responses and the revisions addressed the reviewer\u2019s concerns satisfactorily.\n2.\tWe explain the glimpse sequences for a few images in section 5.4. Note that the images contain a single object; hence one glimpse includes only a small part of an object. We discuss the intuition behind EIG-based glimpse selection at the end of section 5.3. The model finds EIG by anticipating the content of the complete image. At any specific time, the EIG is low for the regions characterizing the believed class and high elsewhere. The model observes glimpses with high EIG in search of new information. As EIG is a measure of Bayesian surprise, it encourages the model to seek the regions that seem novel according to its belief.\n3.\tWe revised the abstract and the introduction sections to emphasize the partial observability in our problem setting. We also added text in the experiment section to emphasize that the CNN and the soft attention model observes the complete images while other models do not.\n4.\tTo the best of our knowledge, Saccader is the most recent hard attention model (Elsayed et al. (2019)). The main contribution in the Saccader model is the attention network and the Saccader cell, designed meticulously to aggregate the global context (see equations 1, 2, and 3). Applying Saccader to the partially observable scenes requires significant modifications to its core modules and warrants additional research, which we believe is outside the scope of the presented work. Other methods, such as the ones proposed by Gregor et al. (2015) and Eslami et al. (2016), rely on the Spatial Transformation Network (STN) (Jaderberg et al. (2015)). The STN only functions when complete spatial information is available.

We address the reviewer\u2019s queries below.\n\n1. **Explainability:** The hard attention models make two predictions, the class-label, and the next glimpse location. While the first prediction is explainable by design, the second prediction is not. In this paper, we propose a model that explains the second prediction, i.e., attention policies. Value at location $l$ in the EIG map suggests the amount of information gained in the class probabilities if the model attends to $l$. We can explain that our model seeks a glimpse that seems to provide maximum information about the class-label.\n\n2. **Building blocks and Partial VAE:** We use a recurrent feature aggregator to extract fixed-length features from a variable number of glimpses, a classifier to predict the class label, and a partial VAE to predict the content yet unobserved. Our model does not have access to the content of the entire image due to the partial observability. The model uses the predicted content to compute the EIG in the absence of actual content. \n\n3. **Training data for Partial VAE:** We train our entire model in an end-to-end fashion on four image classification datasets: MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CINIC-10. Specifically, we use the input image $x$ to evaluate the log-likelihood (eq 3) in the ELBO of the partial VAE.\n\n4. **Ablation study:** We include an ablation study on the normalizing flows in section 5.5 in the revised manuscript.\n\n5. **Classification task for hard attention models:** Researchers frequently use classification task to evaluate the visual hard attention models. Many seminal papers in this area demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention models on image classification (Zheng et al. (2015), Larochelle & Hinton (2010), Mnih et al. (2014), Ba et al. (2015), Jaderberg et al. (2015)). **Performance of a CNN:** We expect any efficient model, including CNN, that observes the entire image to attain the best accuracy. We do not expect hard attention models that observe the image partially or at low resolution to match the former's accuracy. The former provides a better perceptive about the comparison of the latter.\n\nWe thank the reviewer again and request them to inform us if further clarification is required.\n\nReferences:\n* Zheng, Yin, et al. \"A neural autoregressive approach to attention-based recognition.\" International Journal of Computer Vision 113.1 (2015): 67-79.\n* Larochelle, Hugo, and Geoffrey E.

Furthermore, CINIC-10 includes images from the ImageNet dataset.\n2. **Ablation Study:** We have added an ablation study on normalizing flows in Section 5.5 in the revised manuscript.

We note that most existing models observe an entire image and use global information to predict unexplainable attention policies. In contrast, we focus on partially observable scenes where explainable attention policies are critical.  We have added a paragraph at the end of the related works section, which highlights these differences.\n4. **Novelty:** We agree with the reviewer that the proposed model builds on the existing techniques. However, these techniques are less explored in the context of hard attention. We introduce these techniques to the visual attention community in a principled manner. We emphasize that our paper aims at innovating a unified approach towards hard attention where the attention policies are explainable.

We also acknowledge the reviewer for recognizing the spirit of our work i.e. exploring a less explored strategy for explainable hard attention.\n\n##### Q1\n\n**Complexity:** We note that the complexity of EXPAC is minimal. We use only bare essential modules, namely, a recurrent feature aggregator, a classifier, and a partial VAE. As mentioned in a newly added Appendix A, we implement EXPAC with a small number of layers.\n\n**Robustness:** As mentioned in Appendix B (previously Appendix A), we optimize the model for different datasets with the same hyperparameters, indicating robustness in training our model. \n\n**Performance:** We implement EXPAC with an indispensable number of layers. Adding more layers may help in achieving higher accuracy. We do not invest in performing extensive architecture search. Nonetheless, we endeavor to perform a careful and rigorous analysis of our model. \n\n**Datasets:** Classifying a 32x32 image into ten classes is certainly not difficult when an entire image is observed. However, we observe images through a series of small glimpses, which makes a classification task challenging. Furthermore, we evaluate our model on the CINIC-10 dataset, which includes images from the ImageNet dataset.\n\n**Scalability:** One can implement the classifier and Partial VAE using large-scale models such as ResNet (He et al. (2016)) and NVAE (Vahdat & Kautz (2017)). Note that a classifier and a generator are frequently used for multiple tasks in practice, making them readily available for a hard attention model.\n\n##### Q2\n\n**Comparison with Grad-CAM:** A feed-forward classifier observes the complete image and predicts the class-label. On the other hand, a recurrent hard attention model actively senses glimpses and makes two predictions, namely, the class-label and the next glimpse location. A seminal work by Selvaraju et al. (2017) explains the first type of model. It cannot explain the prediction of the next glimpse location based on the partially observed scenes as in hard attention. We focus on the latter problem and develop an attention model with in-build explainability. As our problems are fundamentally different, we cannot compare our work with Selvaraju et al.

We also thank the reviewer for recognizing and acknowledging the strengths of our paper. We address the reviewer's concerns below.\n\n**Contribution:** We delineate our contributions in the last paragraph of the introduction section. Most recent hard attention models based on reinforcement learning observe entire images and use unexplainable attention policies. In contrast, we present *explainable attention policies* for *partially observable* scenes, which is a valuable contribution. As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a paragraph at the end of the related works section, highlighting our contribution to the latest methods.\n\n**Comparison:** Saccader, a great model presented by Elsayed et al. (2019), observes an entire image and gathers global contextual information in the attention network. In contrast, we observe an image only partially through a series of glimpses. As our model does not use global contextual information, we cannot make a fair comparison between the two methods. We compare our method with Minh et al. (2014) as they also work with partially observable scenes.\n\n**Datasets:** Note that we focus on developing a systematic approach to explainable attention policies under partial observability. The partial observability in our problem setting imposes additional constraints, making classification task on simplistic datasets more challenging.

Here we highlight our main contribution, namely achieving *explainability* in the hard attention policies under *partial observability*. We believe this contribution will prove extremely valuable to the visual attention community.\n\nFor a task of image classification, the hard attention models make two predictions that need explanation. First, the models predict the class label based on the observed glimpses, which is explainable by design (Elsayed et al. (2019)). Second, they predict the next attention-worthy glimpse location, for which they do not provide any explanation. We recognize the need to address this important problem based on the observation noted at the end of the first paragraph in the introduction section. Unlike the existing models, we can explain why our model chose to attend a specific location. We use the EIG maps, as displayed in Figure 6 (previously Figure 5), to provide this explanation. The model chooses to attend the glimpses that seem to maximize the EIG in the class label. *The EIG being maximum at the location $l_t$ should be interpreted as a rationale behind selecting a glimpse at $l_t$.*\n\nWe would also like to highlight the partial observability in our problem setting. Like Minh et al. (2014), we observe an image only partially through a series of glimpses to predict the class-label and the attention-worthy location. In contrast, recent works observe an entire image at high resolution and use global context to find attention-worthy locations (Elsayed et al. (2019), Xu et al. (2015), Jaderberg et al. (2015)). Unlike these models, the models like ours and Minh et al. (2014) enjoy a broader range of applications. For instance, consider a mobile edge device that senses the scene through a series of partial observations captured using a moving camera. Here, we can employ our model to guide the camera's movement in the direction of the important region and recognize the scene using partial observations.\n\nLastly, we note that our aim in this paper is to innovate a principled approach towards explainable hard attention under partial observability. We make a unique contribution by presenting a unified framework for this task. We evaluate our model on four datasets and show promising results. We expect our work to kindle interest and stimulate additional research around explainable hard attention.\n\nWe again thank the reviewers for their time and address their queries separately.\n\nReferences:\n* Elsayed, Gamaleldin, Simon Kornblith, and Quoc V.

They proposed a recurrent architecture which sequentially observe regions (glimpse) from an image. To decide where to look next, the model maintains a hidden state and use it to estimate the full image (or features of the image). This \"content prediction\" module allows the model to look ahead and make a decision based on the expected information gain (EIG) over different locations. The objective function (i.e. partial VAE loss and classification loss) in this system is differentiable thus the system can be trained with gradient descent. The authors validated the system on several benchmarks and show comparable performance with baselines.\n\n**Reasons for score:**\n\nThe system seems extremely complicated to me, as it involves multiple components and each component by themselves is very complex. However the output of the system is not so appealing either in performance or explainability. Probably I missed something but I don't quite understand the advantages of the proposed system.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. The core idea for training the attention policy is intuitive, as the information gain is a natural choice for determining the location of next glimpse. It's also appealing that the predicted content can provide sufficient signals to estimate the information gain.\n2. The equation is clear and makes the paper easy to follow.\n3. The careful analysis of the experiments is very informative.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. In general, my biggest concern about this paper is the complexity of the EXPAC system with the moderate performance. It seems that all benchmark datasets used in the paper are not so difficult (e.g., 10-way classification with 32x32 images) and the performance of the proposed system is still far from satisfactory. Therefore, it's questionable whether the system could be scaled to even more challenging (but more practical) datasets like ImageNet. Also I'm curious about the robustness of training such an intricate system. \n2. Regarding explainability, there are quite a few methods (not limited to hard attention) that target the same goal, such as Grad-CAM. However this paper seems to only compare with RAM (and a gist-initialized variation of GRAM). Even if the core algorithm might be different, it's still good to compare with other designs. \n(Selvaraju, Ramprasaath R., et al. \"Grad-cam: Visual explanations from deep networks via gradient-based localization.\" Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision. 2017.)\n3. It seems to me that the content prediction module ($S$ and $D$) is critical as the predicted $\\tilde{x}$ is used for \"lookahead\" to estimate the next $l$. However the predicted $\\tilde{x}$ is never shown in the paper. I think it would be more straightforward to  better understand the performance of the system by comparing the predicted content with the original.\n\n\n**Questions during rebuttal period:**\n\nPlease address my questions in the cons section.", "title": "An overly complicated system for explainable image classification with hard attentions", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"}, "p9ETLFbbs76": {"type": "review", "replyto": "pQq3oLH9UmL", "review": "This paper presents a visual hard-attention image classification model.
