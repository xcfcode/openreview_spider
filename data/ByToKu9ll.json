Specifically, adversaries can inject small perturbations to the input data and therefore decrease the performance of deep neural networks significantly.\nEven worse, these adversarial examples have the transferability to attack a black-box model based on finite queries without knowledge of the target model. \nTherefore, we aim to empirically compare different defensive strategies against various adversary models and analyze the cross-model efficiency for these robust learners. We conclude that the adversarial retraining framework also has the transferability, which can defend adversarial examples without requiring prior knowledge of the adversary models.\nWe compare the general adversarial retraining framework with the state-of-the-art robust deep neural networks, such as distillation, autoencoder stacked with classifier (AEC), and our improved version, IAEC, to evaluate their robustness as well as the vulnerability in terms of the distortion required to mislead the learner.\nOur experimental results show that the adversarial retraining framework can defend most of the adversarial examples notably and consistently without adding additional\nvulnerabilities or performance penalty to the original model.", "keywords": ["Deep learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper investigates several retraining approached based upon adversarial data. While the experimental evaluation looks reasonable, the actual contribution of this paper is quite small. The approaches being evaluated, for the most part, are already proposed in the literature, with the one exception being the \"improved autoencoder stacked with classifier\" (IAEC), which is really just a minor modification to the existing AEC approach with an additional regularization term. The results are fairly thorough, and seem to suggest that the IAEC method performs best in some cases, but this is definitely not a novel enough contribution to warrant publication at ICLR.\n \n Pros:\n + Nice empirical evaluation of several adversarial retraining methods\n \n Cons:\n - Extremely minor algorithmic advances\n - Not clear what is the significant contribution of the paper"}, "review": {"By46A0FIx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "ByToKu9ll", "comment": "We thank all reviewers and readers for the helpful comments!

This provides information about how retraining framework can generalize across different adversarial models.\nHowever, the second point mentioned by the reviewer is from the attacker\u2019s perspective and hope to check if the attacker can generalize their attacks against different defensive models. This is one interesting point but not the scope of this paper here, and in fact such work on transferability of attacks have been discussed in Introduction as reference [Papernot et al., 2016a;b].\n\nWe will also add the discussion of work [1]. We didn\u2019t discuss work [2] when we wrote the paper, since it is another submission for this conference at the same time.

We aim to test the efficacy of different adversarial example generation algorithms here, but we are happy to discuss this work in our revision.\n\nThe \u201crecall\u201d here means the true positive rate.
