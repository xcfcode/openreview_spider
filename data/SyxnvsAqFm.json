Numerous quantization techniques have been proposed to reduce the inference latency/memory consumption. However, these techniques impose a large overhead on the training procedure or need to change the training process. We present a non-intrusive quantization technique based on re-training the full precision model, followed by directly optimizing the corresponding binary model. The quantization training process takes no longer than the original training process. We also propose a new loss function to regularize the weights, resulting in reduced quantization error. Combining both help us achieve full precision accuracy on CIFAR dataset using binary quantization. We also achieve full precision accuracy on WikiText-2 using 2 bit quantization. Comparable results are also shown for ImageNet. We also present a 1.5 bits hybrid model exceeding the performance of TWN LSTM model for WikiText-2.", "keywords": ["quantization", "binary", "ternary", "flat minima", "model compression", "deep learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The authors propose a technique for quantizing neural networks, which consist of repeated quantization/de-quantization operations during training, and the second step learns scale factors.

With resnet32, our accuracy loss is 0.11%, with final accuracy matching that from TTQ. However, unlike TTQ, our occasional distortion reduces amount of computation overhead from quantization and does not require any intrusive change in the training procedure. Also refer to our response to AnonReviewer2 for more details on this.\n\nThe greedy quantization has low overhead to the original training time (10% and 15% of the training time for 1bit and 2bit quantization). Using more sophisticated techniques like refined, alternating quantization leads more overhead (over 5x, 40x compared to the training time respectively). As table 3 shows the benefit of these quantization methods, our training method, unlike existing methods, performs quantization once every 500 iterations, nullifying the overheads of these quantization to less than 10% of the original training time. We have updated our manuscript accordingly as well.\n1 bit quantization leads to almost 32x reduction in parameter size, while ternary and 2 bit quantization reduce parameters by almost 16x.\n\nPlease refer to our response for AnonReviewer1 for our imagenet results in comparison with Zhou et al.

B represents the sign of the weights and \\alpha gives the value. As the training converges, the updates to the weights get smaller and smaller. This makes it more difficult for the weight to flip their sign bit, resulting in faster convergence of B. \nAs \\alpha belongs to floating point space, small updates are important for the convergence of \\alpha. However, as B belongs to binary space, small updates do not affect B due its coarse-grained binary space, leading to faster convergence of B.\n\nPhase II (just train \\alpha) reduces the computation overhead significantly. Phase II reduces the number of trainable parameters (approx. 1/1000 of the total parameters are trained) resulting in fewer parameter updates. Further, phase II does not need to perform the quantized-distortion step. Also, the forward-backward propagation are faster as the weights are represented in binary format (B, \\alpha) instead of full precision weights.\n\nThe proposed method differs from BinaryConnect/Xnor-net in the back-propagation step. Xnor-net evaluate the loss using binary weights and applies the updates to full-precision weights. Xnor-net performs quantization every step, which requires them to do binary backward propagation (needing a major change in training procedure).\n\nOn cifar10 and cifar100 experiments with WideResNet, our method recovers full accuracy with its baseline (baseline is taken from Tensorflow models implementation given in https://github.com/tensorflow/models) as given in Table 2. McDonnell (2018) are unable to reach their baseline (although they have a higher baseline because they changed the model structure and training).\n\nOn imagenet, our method gets comparable results with Xnor-net. Zhou et al. (2018) performs training for each layer separately requiring them to increase the number of forward propagation to be done. This scale the effective number of epochs by the number of layers. For resnet32, this scales the effective epochs by 32x. In contrast, the proposed method performs the quantization training in the original training time. As the training time is too large with layer-by-layer training for large networks, we have targeted feasibility of our method over improved results.", "title": "reply"}, "SJxdMvH9pX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SJl-NOn7TQ", "comment": "Thank you for the review.\n\nIn \"Retraining-Based Iterative Weight Quantization for Deep Neural Networks\", the concept of \"exploration vs exploitation\" was missing leading to longer training time (up to 6x of the original training time). Further, it also led to very low accuracy as we analysed the sensitivity of the quantization step size to the accuracy. We introduced a key hyper-parameter of the quantization step size, which determines the amount of weight distortion and the amount of retraining time (amount of convergence until the next step). Quantization step size was the key to make the technique work for CNNs.\n\nThe L_KM loss function proposed helps reduce the variance of the weights compared to L2 loss, resulting in better approximation of \\alpha. The biggest effect of L_KM loss is presented in \"One-step Quantization\" in section 5.3, where quantization is performed without any retraining. Using L_KM doubles accuracy compared to just using L2 loss (84.51% with L_KM compared to 44.33% with L2 loss) due to reduced variance of the weights sharing the same \\alpha.\n\nThere are many good quantization methods for CNN to use only 1bit or 2bit formats (including ternary). For CNN, our goal was to show our advantage in the computation complexity while training the quantized model (Our training method performs fewer quantization operations as analysed in section 5.5). However, for RNNs, it is still challenging to quantize with 1-2 bits (Table 3), where we perform better than the existing methods.  \n\nPlease refer to our response for AnonReviewer1 for our imagenet results in comparison with Zhou et al.

The proposed approach has two phases, the first phase performs quantization and de-quantization at certain iterations during training, where the schedule of these operations are hyperparameters specified a priori. The second phase focuses on training the scaling factor. The first phase is similar to the iterative quantization method proposed in \u201cRetraining-Based Iterative Weight Quantization for Deep Neural Networks\u201d, and differs in that this work performs the quantization and de-quantization operations more frequently.\nThis work also proposed a modified version of L2 regularization, but it\u2019s not clear how much benefit it provides compared to a regular L2 regularization. There is also a shuffling approach, but seems to provide limited improvement.\nThe experiment results in general does not provide convincing evidence that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. For example, the ResNet-32 on CIFAR-10 result does not perform better than the one reported in \u201cTrained ternary quantization\u201d, and the ImageNet result is also worse than some existing works.\nThe work is lack of novelty and the results do not show significant improvement over existing approaches.\n", "title": "Limited novelty and does not provide significant improvement compared to existing approaches", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "SkgUjCCFhX": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SyxnvsAqFm", "review": "The paper is a little hard to follow and some parts are poorly written. While the authors claim that they use the greedy approach (in sec 2) for quantization where both B and \\alpha are learned in a greedy way, it is not clear why there is convergence difference between the two as claimed by the authors in section 3.1. Moreover, the authors claimed faster convergence of B than \\alpha because fewer bit clips are observed from the left subplot of Figure 2. However, this conclusion is not quite convincing because 1) on the right subplot of Figure 2, it seems that \\alpha also becomes more stable after 80k iterations; 2) the fewer bit clips may comes from using a stepwise learning rate decay scheme. Thus, the motivation for using another phase to train the \\alpha is not strong.\n\nThe iterative quantization approach has limited novelty. It is similar to many quantization methods like BinaryConnect and Xnor-Net, except that the quantization step is not done immediately after the BP and model updates, but after some iterations of full-precision training. Moreover, these methods also use full-precision weights for update during training.\n\nClarity in the experiments section is a little better than the previous sections. However,\n- The proposed method only performs comparably with TTQ, and shows significant accuracy drop on the Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 datasets (especially on Cifar-100)\n- On the ImageNet dataset, there is a large accuracy drop of the proposed method compared to Zhou et al.
