This allows the  DNN to abstain on confusing or difficult-to-learn examples while improving performance on the non-abstained samples. We show that such deep abstaining classifiers can: (i) learn representations for structured noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features -- and then learn to abstain based on such features; (ii) enable robust learning in the presence of arbitrary or unstructured noise by identifying noisy samples; and (iii) be used as an effective out-of-category detector that learns to reliably abstain when presented with samples from  unknown classes. We provide analytical results on loss function behavior that enable automatic tuning of accuracy and coverage, and demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier using multiple image benchmarks, Results indicate significant improvement in learning in the presence of label noise.", "keywords": ["deep learning", "robust learning", "abstention", "representation learning", "abstaining classifier", "open-set detection"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The reviewers felt that the method was natural and the writing was mostly clear (although could be improved by providing better signposting and fixing typos).

Since the main concern raised was lack of comparisons to existing work, we mainly address that in the update to the paper. The most significant update in this regard is Section 4  \u2014learning in the presence of unstructured noise \u2014 as most existing works tackle this kind of noise. We compare to multiple baselines  and demonstrate the strong performance of the DAC in this setting (Section 4, Table 1) . \n\nThe DAC was originally conceived as a representation learner for structured noise (even though it has proved useful in other scenarios as well, as detailed in the paper). The beginning of section 3 has been updated with  discussions on the motivation and citations to relevant work that discuss this type of noise . Even though here are very few works addressing the issue of structured  noise in deep learning, as suggested by reviews and comments, we have added comparisons of the DAC to other  abstention mechanisms in this setting (Sections 3.1 and 3.2) . We also show how the noise learning property of the DAC can be used in conjunction with such mechanisms to improve predictive performance.\n\nIn summary, updated results indicate that the DAC is a very effective booster of performance in the presence of multiple types of noise.  The added performance gain as well as the simplicity of implementation makes it a strong contender for being part of a deep learning pipeline that involves learning in the presence of noise.\n", "title": "Summary of Updates to Paper"}, "rkxlX7u9Am": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hklv2HpdhX", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions on improving the paper.\n\nWe have added new comparisons to abstention  mechanisms based on softmax thresholding and selective guaranteed risk (see response above) in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Results show the performance boost resulting from using the DAC in scenarios with structured noise. These include numerous accuracy-coverage curves for clearer comparisons.\n\nNumerous comparisons have also been added to the results in Section 4. Please see Table 1 and accompanying discussion.\n\nRegarding the need for smudging in the openset detection task (Section 6), please see caption for figure 5 (this was inadvertently missing in the first submission) and the discussion in Section 6 that illustrates the procedure. The training process of the DAC results in the smudge (or any fixed feature) being strongly associated with the abstention class, except in the presence of features of known classes.  In the latter case, the activation of the fixed feature is suppressed and class features are dominant. When class features are not present, the fixed feature is dominant. The filter visualizations in Figure 5 illustrate this phenomenon.\n\nDuring inference, the image to be classified is augmented with the fixed feature, and unless known class features suppress the activation of the fixed feature, the classification is always routed to the abstention class. One might think of the fixed feature as a \"feature threshold\" that needs to be overcome by an object from a known class to be recognized as one.\n\nNote, that it is merely a matter of convenience that we chose the same fixed feature (smudge) in the open set detection task as in Section 3.1. The feature can be any pattern that is not expected to occur in the images of interest.\n\nFinally, as you suggested, a layout description has been added at the end of Section 1 to better guide the reader.\n\nRegards,\nDAC Authors.", "title": "Response to AnonReviewer2"}, "SklpLawcAm": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BklSo4p9nm", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions on improving the paper.\n\n1. The loss function introduced in the DAC allows for a new way of learning in the presence of noise. By allowing an abstention option while training (which to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored elsewhere), the DAC is able to very effectively learn signals that are indicative of noise (this is the structured noise scenario) and improve classification performance.   We also provide an updated discussion on motivation at the beginning of section 3.\n\n2.  Please  see updated results and risk-coverage  plots in section 3.1 and 3.2 where we compare to other abstention mechanisms. In particular, we compare to softmax thresholds as well as the recently proposed selective guaranteed risk in [1]. While the DAC offers improved performance (in terms of accuracy and coverage) in these settings, it can also be used alongside these  methods for quantifying uncertainty.\n\n3.

However, I think this paper has some issues which are listed below:\n\n\n1)  Although there are very few works regarding abstaining in DNN, I would like to see what the paper offers that is not addressed by the existing literature. Right now, in the experiment, there is no comparison to the previous work, and in the introduction, the difference is not clear. I think having an extra related work section regarding comparison would be useful.\n\n2) The experiment section was thorough, and the authors look at the performance of DAC at different angles; however, as far as I understand one of the significant contributions of the paper is to define abstain class during training instead of post-processing (e.g., abstaining on all examples where the network has low confidence). Therefore, I would like to see a better comparison to a network that has soft-max score cut-off rather than plain DNN. In figure 1-d the comparison is not clear since you did not report the coverage. I think it would be great if you can compare either with related work or tune a softmax-score on a validation set and then compare with your method. \n\n3) There are some typos, misuse of \\citet instead of \\citep spacing between parenthesis; especially in figures, texts overlap, the spacing is not correct, some figures don\u2019t have a caption, etc.\n", "title": "Good paper, writing and comparison need to be improved", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "Hklv2HpdhX": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rJxF73R9tX", "review": "This manuscript introduces deep abstaining classifiers (DAC) which modifies the multiclass cross-entropy loss with an abstention loss, which is then applied to perturbed image classification tasks.

Their main idea is to introduce a new modified loss function that utilizes an absention output allowing the DNN to learn when abstention is a better option. The core idea resemble KWIK framework [1], which has been theoretical justified.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The authors find a new direction for learning with noisy labels. Based on Eq. (1) (the modified loss), the propose \\alpha auto-tuning algorithm, which is relatively novel. \n\n2. The authors perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of their framework. And their experimental result support their previous claims.\nFor example, they conduct experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Besides, they conduct experiments on open-world detection dataset.\n\nCons:\n\nWe have three questions in the following.\n\n1. Clarity: in Section 3, the author claim real-world data is corrupted in some non-arbitrary manner. However, in practice, it is really hard to reason the corrpution procedure for agnostic noisy dataset like Clothing1M [2]. The authors are encouraged to explain this point more.\n\n2. Related works: In deep learning with noisy labels, there are three main directions, including small-loss trick [3], estimating noise transition matrix [4,5], and explicit and implicit regularization [6]. I would appreciate if the authors can survey and compare more baselines in their paper.\n\n3. Experiment: \n3.1 Baselines: For noisy labels, the author should compare with [7] directly, which is highly related to your work. Namely, designing new loss function can overcome the issue of noisy labels. Without this comparison, the reported result has less impact. Moreover, the authors should add MentorNet [2] as a baseline https://github.com/google/mentornet\n\n3.2 Datasets: For datasets, I think the author should first compare their methods on symmetric and aysmmetric noisy data. Besides, the authors are encouraged to conduct 1 NLP dataset.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] L. Li, M. Littman, and T. Walsh. Knows what it knows: a framework for self-aware learning. In ICML, 2008.\n\n[2] T.
