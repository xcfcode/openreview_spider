The inference approach that estimates the transition rates between each possible pair of alternatives via maximum likelihood suffers when the examples of each alternative are scarce and is inappropriate when new alternatives can be observed at test time. In this work, we propose an amortized inference approach for PCMC by embedding its definition into a neural network that represents transition rates as a function of the alternatives' and individual's features. We apply our construction to the complex case of airline itinerary booking where singletons are common (due to varying prices and individual-specific itineraries), and context effects and behaviors strongly dependent on market segments are observed. Experiments show our network significantly outperforming, in terms of prediction accuracy and logarithmic loss, feature engineered standard and latent class Multinomial Logit models as well as recent machine learning approaches.", "keywords": ["choice modeling", "pairwise choice Markov chains", "deep learning", "amortized inference", "automatic differentiation", "airline itinerary choice modeling"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "This submission proposes to use neural networks in combination with pairwise choice markov chain models for choice modelling.

The approach of the paper is well motivated intuitively, but could more explicitly show that PCMC-Net is needed to fix inferential problems with PCMC and that e.g. SGD and some regularization + the linear parameterization suggested by the original PCMC authors isn't scalable in itself. \n3. The approximation theorem is useful and clean, and the empirical results are intriguing. While consideration of more datasets would improve the results, the metrics and baselines considered demonstrate a considerable empirical case for this method. \n\nMy \"weak accept\" decision is closer to \"accept\" than \"weak reject.\" (Edit 11/25/19: I raised my score in to accept in conjunction with the author's improvements in the open discussion phase)\n\nImprovement areas(all relatively minor):\n- While I personally enjoy the choice axioms focused on by the PCMC model and this paper, stochastic transitivity, IIA, and regularity are probably more important to emphasize than Contractibility. Because the properties of UE and contractibility were not used, it may be more appropriate to use this space to introduce more of the literature on neural-nets-as-feature-embeddings stuff. \n- This paper could be improved by generalizing to a few other choice models- in particular the CDM (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03266) may be a good candidate for your method. This is more a suggestion for future work if you expand this promising initial result. \n- Hyper-parameter tuning: I noticed that several of your hyper parameters were set to extremal values for the ranges you considered. If you tuned the other algorithms' hyper parameters the same way, it could be the case that the relative performance is explained by the appropriateness of those ranges. Would be interesting to have a more in-depth treatment of this, but I do understand that it's a lot of work. \n\n\nSpecific Notes:\nTheorem 1 is nice, and the proof is clean, but doesn't explicitly note that a PCMC model jointly specifies a family of distributions \\pi_S for each S \\in 2^U obtained by subsetting a single rate matrix Q indexed by U. It's clear that PCMC-Net will still approximate under this definition, as \\hat q_ij  approximates each q_ij because \\hat q_ij doesn't depend on S. While the more explicit statement is true with the same logic in the theorem, the notational choice to have \"X_i\" represent the \"i-th\" element in S is confusing at first, as e.g. X_1 is a different feature vector for S = {2,3} and S={1,3}. I don't see this issue as disqualifying, but it took me a while to realize that there wasn't more than a notational abuse problem when I returned to the definitions where the indexing depended on the set S under consideration. \n\n\nTypos/small concerns:\n-Above equation (1), the number of parameters in Q_S is |S|(|S|-1) rather than (|S|-1)^2, as each of the |S| alternatives has a transition rate to the other |S|-1 alternatives. \n-Below equation (3), I think you mean j \\in S rather than 1<= j <= |S|, as S may not be {1,2,...,|S|}. Later I noticed that you always index S with {1,\\dots,|S|}, but using i \\in S in combination with 1<=j<=|S| was a bit confusing. \n-X_i as the i-th element of S is a bit of an abuse of notation, as it surpasses dependence on S\n-In Figure 1, you show X_0 in a vector that is referred to as \"S.\" It is my understanding that X_0 represents user features. As the user is not in the set, this is confusing. The use of a vertical ellipsis to connect \\rho(X_0) to \\rho(X_1) is also confusion, as \\rho(X_1) is input into the Cartesian product while X_0 is input into the direct sum. \n\nOverall, nice job! Really enjoyed the paper and approach, good to see connections made between these literatures so that progress in discrete choice can be used at scale. \n", "title": "Official Blind Review #4", "rating": "8: Accept", "confidence": 4}, "S1xfZCnTKB": {"type": "review", "replyto": "BJgWE1SFwS", "review": "This paper introduces a novel approximate inference method, called PCMC-Net, for models from the family of Pairwise Choice Markov Chains (PCMC). The method relies on training a neural network. Consequently, the authors claim that inference is amortized, but its computational complexity is still quadratic in the number of choice alternatives due to separate processing of all pairs of alternatives. PCMC-Net bakes the definition of PCMC into the neural net structure and therefore satisfies the theoretical properties of contractability and uniform expansion, which are desired properties of choice models\nMoreover, since choice probabilities are a function of choice candidates\u2019 features (and features of an individual making the choice), this method allows for new (unseen) choice candidates at test time, which was not possible with previously proposed maximum-likelihood (ML) inference. The approach is evaluated on modelling the choice of airline itinerary, on which it outperforms all considered baselines by a significant margin.\n\nI recommend REJECTing this paper. This paper tackles the problem of efficient inference and test-time generalization (to unseen choice alternatives) for choice modelling, and the proposed approach is interesting, seems to be theoretically sound, and outperforms evaluated baselines. Experimental evaluation is insufficient, however, with the method assessed only on a single dataset---in which case it is unclear if the method is better than baselines in general, or whether it is a quirk of the considered dataset. Moreover, the authors do not compare to ML inference in PCMC, which seems to be the closest possible baseline; instead, the authors only mention that ML would overfit on this dataset. Finally, the paper is full of complicated terms and cumbersome notation, which makes it difficult to read. Technical terms are often used without definition (e.g. framing effects, Luce\u2019s axiom, asymmetric dominance), which makes the paper inaccessible to an inexperienced reader like myself.\n\nI think that this work could be improved in the following ways. The exposition should be made simpler and easier to follow (especially section 2), and all technical terms should be appropriately defined. Additionally, the method should be evaluated on at least one more dataset and compared to ML inference for PCMC. I am happy to increase my score if (all) the above points are addressed.\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 1}, "BygUPA_hoS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "S1xfZCnTKB", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions.\nRegarding the technical terms: framing effect was replaced by context effect which is more standard and is now properly defined in the introduction along with the other choice-theoretic terms. We added an example to motivate the definition of contractibility in Section 2.\nWe added a new experiment---see new Section 4--- that uses a different dataset that illustrates these context effects and compares to the original PCMC.\nAlthough it is possible to compare to the original PCMC by resorting to a discretization of the feature space, it quickly becomes impractical as the number of attributes and the number of bins grow, making it inappropriate on a complex dataset such as the airline itinerary choice one, which is the point of proposing the PCMC-Net approach.\n", "title": "Response"}, "BklhlAuniS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJxDQbYstS", "comment": "Thank you for your comments and suggestions.\n\t\u2022 Regarding the jargon: we added a paragraph explaining the different types of effects and a new experiment on a synthetic dataset illustrating them--see new Section 4---.\n\t\u2022 Amortized inference: the same parameters are used to determine the transition rates between any pair of alternatives (even unseen ones) in contrast to the original PCMC approach that requires one statistical parameter for each possible pair of alternatives of the universe.

Additive smooting adds a pseudo-count (e.g. \\alpha=0.1) to each counter to avoid numerical instabilities when doing the MLE optimization. The remark was taken from the original paper and refers to performance. The epsilon used in our work is used to enforce the constraint that defines PCMC, ensuring the existence and unicity of the stationary distribution and has no effect on performance.\n\t\u2022 Contractibility guarantees that the model behaves well when alternatives can be partitioned into classes of equivalence. This has practical modeling importance when equivalent alternatives are present in the choice set like in the classical Red Bus/Blue Bus example where the color of the bus is irrelevant to the preference of transportation mode \"bus\" with respect to the \"car\" mode. For example, MNL models reduce the probability of choosing the car mode when multiple color variants of buses are added, which does not match empirical behavior.

Previous approaches to fitting PCMCs have leveraged sequential least squares programming, making optimization unstable, the model prone to overfitting, and test-time inference difficult.  The authors propose parametrizing PCMCs with neural networks to fix these issues.  Relying on universal function approximation results, the authors show that their PCMC-Net can represent arbitrary transition matrices.  The experiments report results on a dataset of airline booking behavior, comparing PCMC-Net with four other baselines from the literature.\n\nPros:  Although I was previously unfamiliar with the PCMC model, using a neural network parametrization seems novel and well motivated.
