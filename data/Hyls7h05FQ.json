We address the concerns as follows:\n\n1) Model assumptions\n\nIf we understand correctly, the commenter worries that the implied assumption w->s->c (first select a sense s from word w, then generate the context c) of our model is flawed, because they think w and c are not independent given s. They provide an example to show when w and c should not be independent given s. They suggest that we should model \u201cthe collocation of senses\u201d (Qiu et al. 2016) instead of \u201cthe collocation of words and sense\u201d like Li & Jurafsky (2015) to address this concern.  \n\nFirst, we\u2019d like to argue that no model assumption is perfect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), for example, both Bag-of-Word model and LDA are flawed language model, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not useful. Without mentioning what consequences our model assumptions would cause in training, testing, or evaluation, the commenter's concern seems to be purely cognitive/theoretical. Nevertheless, we're happy to discuss with the commenter about it\n\nWe think that the commenter may have misunderstood a few points and the assumption w->s->c is not a concern. The conditional independence of w and c given sense could hold based on our assumption (we discuss using the commenter\u2019s example in 1.2 below). \n\n\nMoreover, the evaluations demonstrate that our model is able to learn distinguishable senses and succeeds in both similarity-based and human evaluations. We agree that the model approach of Qiu et al. (2016) also makes sense, but it is not necessarily better than ours, as shown in our evaluation where ours outperform theirs (Table 1). \n\nIn detail:\n1.1 The commenter may have an inaccurate understanding about our premise.\n\nWe\u2019d like to reassure the commenter that our model does not share senses among words, like *all* multi-prototype models. Also, the premise is not to learn \u201csame\u201d embeddings for words that have the same sense. It is to learn similar embeddings for certain senses of words that are synonyms (share similar contexts). Two words may be synonyms, but they won\u2019t have identical senses. \n\n1.2  The commenter worries \u201cc is not independent of w given s\u201d, if we understand correctly, they think \u201cnot sharing senses\u201d could be a solution but not quite. \n\nHowever, no matter the senses are shared across words or not, we can have c independent of w given s. \n           \nA. When not sharing senses (our case),\n\n         P(w_i | s_i^k) = 1, i.e., given a specific sense of a word, the surface word type is fixed, therefore P(w, c|s) = P(w|s)*p(c|s) = P(c|s).\n\n>>>\nFor example, \"guy\" and \"man\" are synonym, but one is more casual and the other is more formal. Hence, despite the same sense, different realization would cause the contexts to be more (or less) formal.\n<<<\n\nIn this example, \u201cguy\u201d and \u201cman\u201d won\u2019t be associated to the same sense vector. One sense of \u201cguy\u201d s_{guy}^i and one sense of \u201cman\u201d s_{man}^j may be similar but are two separate embeddings, which would have distinct (perhaps close) P(c|s_{guy}^i) and P(c| s_{man}^j). Ideally, P(c|s_{guy}^i) would result in more casual expression while P(c| s_{man}^j) results in formal expression. Therefore, this case won\u2019t result in the commenter\u2019s concern.\n\n     B. When senses are shared among words\n\nIn the commenter's example: it is possible that senses are divided to s_{man_casual}, s_{man_formal} and s_others, once we observe s_{man_casual}, we know that the context should be casual rather than formal no matter it\u2019s generated by \u201cman\u201d or \u201cguy\u201d. \n\nSurely the surface word type eventually affect its context, in the way that \u201cguy\u201d may have a higher probability to generate s_{man_casual} while \u201cman\u201d may have a higher probability to generate s_{man_formal}.\n\nAlthough \u201cman\u201d and \u201cguy\u201d are synonyms, they will have different distribution: P(s_i| guy) and P(s_i|man).\n\nIdeally, \nP(s_{man_casual}|guy) > P(s_{man_formal}|guy),\n and \nP(s_{man_casual}|man) < P(s_{man_formal}|man). \n\nIf they have the same distribution, it means that the usage of \u201cguy\u201d and \u201cman\u201d are identical, which contradicts the commenter\u2019s statement \u201cone is more casual and the other is more formal\u201d. \n", "title": "Address the commenter's question 1"}, "S1exdsXGkE": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rygvBxcJyN", "comment": "\n2) Approximation in Eq. (5)\n\nWe add the approximation notation because we estimate the sense disambiguation distribution with local context instead of using the global word sense distribution (Tian et al. 2014). We assume that we can disambiguate senses based on local context. The same assumption is adopted by Neelakantan et al. (2014), Li and Jurafsky (2015), Lee and Chen (2017), etc. Moreover, if we consider the original Skip-Gram, each word-context pair counted is in a fixed context window, the local context is given, the left side is also implicitly conditioned on the local context within the window. We will revise the notation to make this clear.\n\n\n3) Parameters\n\nThanks for pointing out this. We do not claim in the paper that learning two sets of parameters is our contribution. In fact, several previous works apply the same parameter setting, such as Tian et al. (2014), Neelakantan et al. (2014) [the additional centers are computed with context parameters] and Li and Jurafsky (2015). Despite the same parameter setting, similar to previous work, our novelty lies in *different* mechanisms to disambiguate and select senses. We highlight the # of parameters in responses mainly to differentiate our work from Lee and Chen (2017), mentioning the parameter setting is also the basis in discussing sense disambiguation and sense selection mechanism. \n\n\n4) Analysis of estimator\n\n>>>\nIf the gumbel softmax estimation is an important novelty to this paper, the analysis of the estimator should be shown instead of the end-to-end performance. \n<<<\n\nWe thank the commenter for this insight! We agree that Gumbel Softmax (GS) and RL approach have their advantages/disadvantages. However, the focus of our paper is not a direct comparison of GS and RL but rather to develop an efficient but effective sense embedding model and to answer \u201cwhat are good sense embeddings\u201d. The goal is to learn sense vectors that both capture semantics and are distinguishable to human. Thus, with limited space, following previous work, we focus on evaluating the quality of the learned embeddings and propose a new human evaluation method to exam the ability of the proposed model in learning human distinguishable senses.

We add an evaluation on the recently released WiC dataset in the revision. We focus the evaluation on the sense selection module of the model and classify the senses in an unsupervised fashion. Our model achieves the highest accuracy among competing models (Table 2), except for DeConf which is a supervised sense model that annotates senses on the same lexical resource (WordNet) that was used to build WiC. \n\nWe believe that the word similarity tasks demonstrate that each sense-specific embedding learned by our model captures good semantics in addition to better sense disambiguation ability. The high quality of each sense embeddings demonstrates the benefits of using Gumbel softmax. Therefore we decide to keep this evaluation in the revision, but it is more meaningful alongside the WiC results.\n\n2) Novelty\n\n>>>\nThe only difference between the proposed one and Lee and Chen (2017) is Gumbel softmax instead of reinforcement learning between sense selection and representation learning modules.\n<<<\nWe appreciate that the reviewer noticed the similarity between our models with MUSE by Lee and Chen (2017), as both try to improve the sense selection module with hard attention. However, the overall structure of our model (Figure 1) is quite different, in addition to using Gumbel Softmax (GS) instead of RL for hard attention, we\u2019d like to explain the differences on two key aspects:\n\nModel structure and parameters: MUSE learns *four* sets of parameters: sense representations for target words U, collocation context representations V, and two additional matrix P, Q to estimate sense selection distribution for both target words and contexts (both target and context have multiple senses). \nIn contrast, ours learns *two* sets of parameters (Section 3.1): sense representations for target words S and global context representations C. We use C to disambiguate senses of target words S instead of using additional parameters like in MUSE, which reduces the number of total parameters in our model. Furthermore, we update S and C in both the sense selection and context prediction modules, as these two modules are \u201csymmetric\u201d (predicting senses by context and predict context by word sense) and both help to capture the semantics in words.  Moreover, similar to Neelakantan et al. (2014), we do not disambiguate senses for context words (one global vector per context word) to further reduce the parameter size.\n\nOptimization function: We use the (scaled) GS instead of straight-through (scaled) GS to have a stronger error signal (update not only the senses that are chosen but also the ones that are not).  To use a distribution instead of a one-hot selection and reduce the computational cost by negative sampling, we optimize the lower bound of the original negative sampling Skip-Gram objective with marginalization and Jensen's Inequality. Using straight-through (scaled) GS learns worse sense embeddings (lower word similarity score and human-model consistency) than (scaled) GS. Due to space limitations, we didn\u2019t include the comparison in the paper. RL methods are similar to ST-GS since they also make a hard selection each time and update the selected senses but not others. \n\n>>>\nthe idea from the proposed model is similar to Li and Jurafsky (2015), because the sense selection is not one-hot but a distribution.\n<<<\nLi and Jurafsky (2015) sample one-hot senses during the training with Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) and model the CRP with a distribution; while we directly use the distribution and implement the standard skip-gram objective with marginalization over senses. \n\n3) Error analysis \n\n>>>\nMoreover, there is no error analysis about the result on the proposed contextual word sense selection task, which may shed more light on the strength and weakness of the model. \n<<<\nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2019s suggestion!

The simplest way to model words that have more than 3 senses is to initialize all words with more senses and prune aggressively; we set K=3 mainly for purpose of comparison. We think both implementing a dynamic number of senses (e.g., by setting a threshold to split senses) and evaluating on end tasks are great ideas; given the limited space, we\u2019ll address these in future work.\n\n2\uff09benefits of differentiability\n\nIn addition to updating the sense selection module and context prediction module at the same time, full differentiability allows updates to flow to all senses, not only the ones chosen by the attention, which results in stronger error signals and better sense selection ability. While approximating hard attention still guarantees that the model will focus on specific senses so that each sense captures good semantics (Table 3) and is interpretable to humans (Section 6), the Gumbel-softmax trick helps to guarantee both with the original objective, and we don\u2019t need additional parameters for the policy network in RL.\n\n>>>\nFor example, the contrast with Lee and Chen (2017) seems to be only that of differentiability. \n<<<\nWe also contrast the sense selection module with Lee and Chen (2017) in the related work and Section 3.1. The overall structure of the two models are actually different, Lee and Chen (2017) learn *four* set of parameters while we learn *two*.

The key idea behind this method is to learn a sense embedding tensor using a skip-gram style training objective. The objective defines the probability of contexts marginalised over latent sense embeddings. The paper uses Gumbel-softmax reparametrization trick to approximate sampling from the discrete sense distributions. The method also uses a separate hyperparameter to help scale the dot product appropriately. \n\nStrengths:\n\n1. The technique is a well-motivated solution for a hard problem that builds on the skip-gram model for learning word embeddings.\n2. A new manual evaluation approach for comparing sense induction approaches.\n3. The empirical advance while relatively modest appears to be significant since the technique seems to yield better results than multiple baselines across a range of tasks. \n\nSuggestions:\n\n1. The number of senses is fixed to three. This is a bit arbitrary, even though it is following some precedence. I like the information in the appendix that shows how to handle cases when there are duplicate senses induced for words that dont have many senses. It would be useful to know how to handle the cases where a word can have more than three senses. Given that the authors have a way of pruning duplicate senses, it would have been interesting to try a few basic methods that select the number of senses per word dynamically. \n\n2. The evaluation includes word similarity task and crowdsourcing for sense intrusion and sense selection. These provide a measure of intrinsic quality of the sense based embeddings. However, as Li and Jurafsky (2015) point out, typically applications use more powerful models that use a wide context. It is not clear how these improvements to sense embeddings will translate in these settings. It would have been useful to have at least one or two end applications to illustrate this. \n\n\n3. Given that the empirical gains are not quite consistent, I would encourage the authors to specifically argue why this particular method should be favoured over other existing methods. The related work discussion merely highlights methodological differences. For example, the contrast with Lee and Chen (2017) seems to be only that of differentiability. Is the claim that differentiability is desirable because this allows for fine tuning in applications? If this is the case then it will be nice to have this verified. \n\n4. The lower bound on the log likelihood objective is good but what are we supposed to take away from it? Is it that there is an interpretation that allows us to get away with negative sampling? \n\nOverall I like the paper. It presents an application of the Gumbel-softmax trick for sense embeddings induction and shows some empirical evidence for the usefulness of this idea, including some manual evaluation. \n\nI think the evaluation could be strengthened with some end applications and much crisper arguments on why the method is preferable over other methods that achieve comparable performance.\n\nReferences:\n\n[Li and Jurafsky., EMNLP 2015] Do Multi-Sense Embeddings Improve Natural Language Understanding?\n\n\n", "title": "Neat idea applying Gumbel-softmax to multi sense embeddings", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "BkgDZsDThQ": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Hyls7h05FQ", "review": "* Summary\n\n  This paper extends the skipgram model using one vector per sense of a word.
