LSTMs (and RNNs in general) model sequences along the forward time direction. Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs), which model sequences along both forward and backward directions, generally perform better at such tasks because they capture a richer representation of the data. In the training of Bi-LSTMs, the forward and backward paths are learned independently. We propose a variant of the Bi-LSTM architecture, which we call Variational Bi-LSTM, that creates a dependence between the two paths (during training, but which may be omitted during inference). Our model acts as a regularizer and encourages the two networks to inform each other in making their respective predictions using distinct information. We perform ablation studies to better understand the different components of our model and evaluate the method on various benchmarks, showing state-of-the-art performance.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper proposes a method for performing stochastic variational inference for bidirectional LSTMs through introducing an additional latent variable that induces a dependence between the forward and backward directions.  The authors demonstrate that their method achieves very strong empirical performance (log-likelihood on test data) on the benchmark TIMIT and BLIZZARD datasets.\n\nThe paper is borderline in terms of scores with a 7, 6 and 4.  Unfortunately the highest rating also corresponds to the least thorough review and that review seems to indicate that the reviewer found the technical exposition confusing.  AnonReviewer2 also found the writing confusing and discovered mistakes in the technical aspects of the paper (e.g. in Eq 1).  Unfortunately, the reviewer who seemed to find the paper most easy to understand also gave the lowest score.  A trend among the reviewers and anonymous comments was that the paper didn't do a good enough job of placing itself in the context of related work (Goyal et. al, \"Z-forcing\") in particular.  The authors seem to have addressed this (curiously in an anonymous link and not in an updated manuscript) but the manuscript itself has not been updated.\n\nIn general, this paper presents an interesting idea with strong empirical results.   The paper itself is not well composed, however, and can be improved upon significantly.  Taking the reviews into account and including a better treatment of related work in writing and empirically will make this a much stronger paper.\n\nPros:\n- Strong empirical performance (log-likelihood on test data)\n- A neat idea\n- Deep generative models are of great interest to the community\n\nCons:\n- Incremental in relation to Goyal et al., 2017\n- Needs better treatment of related work\n- The writing is confusing and the technical exposition is not clear enough"}, "review": {"HyrTqpoVf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkL8dLWEf", "comment": "We apologize for the confusion. If we consider the Jensen's inequality derived from the term \\log p(b,h) as a starting point, then your argument about using alpha and beta equal to 1 would be absolutely correct. However, we do not have the term \\log p(b,h) in the original objective (equation 4). To arrive at our objective, consider that we have designed the architecture as shown in figure 1. Then we derive equation 10 from equation 5 as follows:\n\n1. The term  p(x_{t+1} | x_{1:t}, z_t, \\tilde{b}_t) in equation 5 is instantiated with p(x_{t+1} | h_t) in equation 10.\n2. The KLD term in equation 10 is an instantiation of the KLD term in equation 5 based on our architecture.\n3. Finally, we add 3 regularization terms: p(x_{t+1} | b_t) + alpha p(b_t | z_t) + beta p(h_t | z_t)\n\nNotice that using only the first two steps as our objective leads to a b_t that is a deterministic but random function of x_t and b_{t-1} depending completely on the initialization of the weights of the backward LSTM. The 3rd step adds two regularizations related to b_t and a regularization on h_t. In other words, you are right in pointing out that equation 10 is not exactly the lower bound stated in equation 5, but rather it is one with added regularization terms which help the model generalize better. Specifically, the regularization term p(x_{t+1}|b_t) helps b_t learn information about future, the second regularization term alpha p(b_t | z_t) makes \\tild{b_t} learn to be close to b_t that can help predict x_{t+1}, and the last regularization term beta p(h_t | z_t) regularizes h_t by imposing a reconstruction loss. \n\nThank you for pointing it out that the name \u201cstochastic gradient\u201d can be misleading since it has been used previously.

The problem context is clearly stated, as is the proposed model.\n\nThe improvements in terms of average log-likelihood are clear. The model does improve over state-of-the-art in some cases, but not all.\n\nBased on the presented findings, it is difficult to determine the quality of the learned models overall, since they are only evaluated in terms of average log likelihood. It is also difficult to determine whether the improvements are due to the model change, or some difference in how the models themselves were trained (particularly in the case of Z-Forcing, a closely related technique). I would like to see more exploration of this point, as the section titled \u201cablation studies\u201d is short and does not sufficiently address the issue of what component of the model is contributing to the observed improvements in average log-likelihood.\n\nHence, I have assigned a score of \"4\" for the following reasons: the quality of the generated models is unclear; the paper does not clearly distinguish itself from the closely-related Z-Forcing concept (published at NIPS 2017); and the reasons for the improvements shown in average log-likelihood are not explored sufficiently, that is, the ablation studies don't eliminate key parts of the model that could provide this information.\n\nMore information on this decision is given in the remainder.\n\n*Clarity*\n\nA lack of generated samples in the Experimental Results section makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of the models; log-likelihood alone can be an inadequate measure of performance without some care in how it is calculated and interpreted (refer, e.g., to Theis et al. 2016, \u201cA Note on the Evaluation of Generative Models\u201d).\n\nThere are some typos and organizational issues. For example, VAEs are reintroduced in the Related Works section, only to provide an explanation for an unrelated optimization challenge with the use of RNNs as encoders and decoders.\n\nI also find the motivations for the proposed model itself a little unclear. It seems unnatural to introduce a side-channel-cum-regularizer between a sequence moving forward in time and the same sequence moving backwards, through a variational distribution. In the introduction, improved regularization for LSTM models is cited as a primary motivation for introducing and learning two approximate distributions for latent variables between the forward and backward paths of a bi-LSTM. Is there a serious need for new regularization in such models? The need for this particular regularization choice is not particularly clear based on this explanation, nor are the improvements state-of-the-art in all cases. This weakens a possible theoretical contribution of the paper.\n\n*Originality*\n\nThe proposed modification appears to amount to a regularizer for bi-LSTMs which bears close similarity to Z-Forcing (cited in the paper). I recommend a more careful comparison between the two methods. Without such a comparison, they are a little hard to distinguish, and the originality of this paper is hard to evaluate. Both appear to employ the same core idea of regularizing an LSTM using a learned variational distributions. The differences *seem* to be in the small details, and these details appear to provide better performance in terms of average log-likelihood on all tasks compared to Z-Forcing--but, crucially, not compared to other models in all cases.", "title": "Interesting ideas; paper could be improved by more ablation experiments, theoretical justifications, and evaluation methods", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "HJg6l0FxM": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkqV-XZRZ", "review": "This paper proposes a particular form of variational RNN that uses a forward likelihood and a backwards posterior.  Additional regularization terms are also added to encourage the model to encode longer term dependencies in its latent distributions.\n\nMy first concern with this paper is that the derivation in Eq. 1 does not seem to be correct.  There is a p(z_1:T) term that should appear in the integrand.\n\nIt is not clear to me why h_t should depend on \\tilde{b}_t.  All paths from input to output through \\tilde{b}_t also pass through z_t so I don't see how this could be adding information.  It may add capacity to the decoder in the form of extra weights, but the same could be achieved by making z_t larger. Why not treat \\tilde{b}_t symmetrically to \\tilde{h}_t, and use it only as a regularizer?  \n\nIn the no reconstruction loss experiments do you still sample \\tilde{b}_t in the generative part?  Baselines where the \\tilde{b}_t -> h_t edge is removed would be very nice.\n\nIt seems the Blizzard results in Figure 2 are missing no reconstruction loss + full backprop.\n\nI don't understand the description of the \"Skip Gradient\" trick.

The model is validated on held-out likelihood via the ELBO on text, handwriting, speech and images. It presents good emprical results and works at par with or better than many other baselines considered.\n\nThe main source of novelty here the choice made in the transition function of z_t to also incorporate an explicit variable to models the hidden state of the backward RNN at inference time and use that random variable in the generative process. This is a choice of structural prior for the transition function of the generative model that I think lends it more expressivity realizing the empirical gains obtained.\n\nI found the presentation of both the model and learning objective to be confusing and had a hard time following it. The source of my confusion is is that \\tilde{b} (the following argument applies equivalently to \\tilde{h}) is argued to be a latent variable. Yet it is not inferred (via a variational distribution) during training.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that an easier to understand way to explain the model is as follows: both \\tilde{b} and \\tilde{h} should be presented as *observed* random variables during *training* and latent at inference time. Training then comprises maximizing the marginal likelihood of the data *and* maximizing the conditional likelihood of the two observed variables(via p_psi and p_eta; conditioned on z_t). Under this view, setting beta to 0 simply corresponds to not observing \\tilde{h_t}. alpha can be annealed but should never be set to anything less than 1 without breaking the semantics of the learned generative model.\n\nConsider Figure 1(b). It seems that the core difference between this work and [Chung et. al] is that this work parameterizes q(Z_t) using x_t....x_T (via a backward RNN). This choice of inference network can be motivated from the point of view of building a better approximation to the structure of the posterior distribution of Z_t under the generative model. Both [Fracarro et. al] and [Krishnan et. al] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09869.pdf) use RNNs from x_T to x_1 to train sequential state space models. [Gao et. al] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08454.pdf) derive an inference network with a block-diagonal structure motivated by correlations in the posterior distribution. Incorporating a discussion around this idea would provide useful context for where this work stands amongst the many sequential deep generative models in the\nliterature.\n\nQuestions for the authors:\n* How important is modeling \\tilde{h_t} in TIMIT, Blizzard and IMDB?\n* Did you try annealing the KL divergence in the PTB experiment.

Indeed, making the forward LSTM \u2018aware\u2019 of the backward LSTM\u2019s state is a crucial factor in improving the expressivity of our model. \n\nWe apologize for the lack of clarity in the submitted version; we have made the text clearer in our latest version. To clarify the doubt you mentioned about \\tilde{b}, we do sample \\tilde{b}_t during training from p_{\\psi}(\\tilde{b}_t | z_t), and feed it to h_t, where z_t is sampled from q_\\phi (z_t | h_{t-1}, b_t).  This process of inferring \\tilde{b}_t and feeding to h_t however is implicitly captured in the term p(x_{t+1} | h_t ). The only \\tilde{b}_t dependent term that appears in the objective is p_{\\psi}(b_t | z_t ), which (to be precise) maximizes p_{\\psi}( \\tilde{b}_t = b_t | z_t ).\n\nRegarding your comment \u201cboth \\tilde{b} and \\tilde{h} should be presented as *observed* random variables during *training* and latent at inference time\u201d, that\u2019s true. \n\nRegarding your comment about not setting alpha to anything less than 1, we are not sure if we understand your concern correctly. We treat alpha as a hyperparameter, so its value should be chosen based on validation set. The positive value of alpha governs how much weightage is given to the reconstruction of b_t vs the rest of the terms in the cost.\n\nAs suggested by the reviewer, here is a brief comparison between our model and the papers cited by the reviewer: \nIn krishnan et al, the data x_t at each time step t is modeled using a VAE with hidden state z, where the approximate posterior q_{\\phi} (z | x) is a function of the forward and backward hidden states, and the KL divergence minimizes the difference between this approximate posterior and the prior over z. The key difference between their model and ours is that their model learns a VAE on the data space, i.e., the reconstruction error is on the data itself, such that the latent variable z of the VAE is a function of the Bi-RNN's hidden states. In our model on the other hand, the VAE is learned on the Bi-LSTM's hidden state, i.e., the reconstruction error is on the forward and backward LSTM's hidden states h_t and b_t which share the latent variable z_t. In Gao et al, the approximate prior at time step t is modeled as q_{\\phi} (z_t | z_{t-1}, x_t ), which factorizes as q_{\\phi} (z_t | z_{t-1} ) . q_{\\phi} (z_t | x_t ). Each of the latter two functions are modeled as Gaussians with mean and variance as a non-linear function of z_{t-1} and x_t respectively. Thus this model does not make use of recurrent neural networks in modeling the data. Secondly, similar to Krishnan et al, this model learns to reconstruct data instead of a hidden space, as in our model.\n\nWe did try experiments without modeling \\tilde{h}_t but found the results to be slightly worse. We believe it acts as a regularizer on the activation h_t learned by the model. But in general the coefficient \\beta used for the reconstruction loss of h_t is a hyperparameter and so it should be chosen using the validation set. \nIndeed, in the ablation studies, we report that the KL term is not useful in the case of PTB dataset because the KL term is small and performance remains unaffected when not including it in the objective. But performance drops in the case of the other datasets if the KL term is removed since for these datasets the KL term is large. \n\nOnce again, we apologize for the lack of clarity.

You are right. We have corrected Eq 1 in our latest version (https://anonfile.com/W6i9bad3b4/ICLR18_VLM.pdf). Please note that our model implementation was not affected by these writing mistakes.\n\nTo answer why it is beneficial to make h_t dependent on \\tilde{b}_t, note that forward and backward LSTMs model data sequences independently in different ways in a traditional Bi-LSTM. Creating the dependence from \\tilde{b}_t to h_t is important to make the forward LSTM use of information from the backward LSTM and thus learn a richer representation. This representation is useful in tasks like next step prediction where only the forward LSTM is used during inference and hence the structure captured by the backward LSTM is lost in the case of a traditional Bi-LSTM. In our model this structure is utilized.\n\nWe did experiments where we remove the connection from \\tilde{b}_t to h_t and found that only using \\tilde{b}_t in the reconstruction cost (as a regularizer) does not produce as good results as our model where both the reconstruction and feeding \\tilde{b}_t to h_t is used. Thus feeding \\tilde{b}_t to h_t helps the forward model during inference. On the flip side, we do not pass \\tilde{h}_t to b_t because we do not use the backward LSTM during inference, and so it may not benefit us.\n\nYes, in the no reconstruction loss experiments we do sample \\tilde{b}_t.\n\nWe have uploaded the Blizzard results in Figure 2 with no reconstruction loss + full backprop that you asked for to this anonymous link https://anonfile.com/j3nbo0dbbd/blz_rec_sdc_full.png It can be seen that reconstruction loss with stochastic backprop yields the best performance compared to all other alternatives.\n\nRegarding setting \\beta=0, we treat it as a hyperparameter and so it is chosen using the validation set. We do not have any explanation why having it zero is better sometimes. \n\nWe have made the description of skip gradient clearer in the latest version. The idea is to stochastically skip gradients of the auxiliary reconstruction costs with respect to the recurrent\nunits from back-propagating through time. To achieve this, at each time step, a mask drawn from a Bernoulli distribution which governs whether to skip the gradient or to back-propagate it for each data sample.", "title": "Clarifications"}, "ByA_NNKzz": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hy7uO8PlG", "comment": "Thank you for your detailed comments. The major concern of the reviewer seems to be the lack of a clear contrast between our proposed model and Z-Forcing, which is closely related to our model. We will try to make this distinction clearer. In order to showcase the differences between Z-Forcing and our model in terms of the differences between how our model is trained, rather than just the architectural differences (as stressed by the reviewer in their comments), we additionally conducted the following experiment which incrementally adds the additional optimization changes to Z-Forcing (that we added to train our model). Specifically we run experiments to see the effects of stochastic backprop on Z-Forcing. We also add a reconstruction cost on h_t in the Z-Forcing model as another separate experiment. So for a detailed comparison, we show the evolution of Bits Per Character (BPC) on PTB for four cases:\n1. Z-forcing\n2. Z-forcing + stochastic backprop (on the auxiliary cost)\n3.

In the paper we already mention that the forward and backward LSTM capture different aspects of a temporal sequence, and this is the reason why (for traditional Bi-LSTMs) concatenating the hidden representations from the two LSTMs leads to better performance in tasks where such a concatenation is possible. However, this concatenation is not possible in the next step prediction tasks (Eg. language generation) where only the forward LSTM must be used during inference. Hence the information captured by the backward LSTM in a Bi-LSTM trained separate from the forward LSTM is lost. For this reason, an objective/regularization that jointly optimizes the two LSTMs in a Bi-LSTM is needed. Other examples of such joint optimization are Z-Forcing and twin networks that we cite in our paper.", "title": "Clarifications and additional experimental results"}, "rJU7Epmef": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1RmckMeM", "comment": "The analysis of our method with and without stochastic backprop as well as with and without reconstruction losses are provided in the ablation studies section (figure 2).

If this is true, then we would like to clarify that in addition to adding the reconstruction cost and feeding z_t to h_t, we also pass \\tilde{b}_t to h_t. Amongst other differences, this is a crucial difference between Z-forcing and our model. In other words, during training, we sample \\tilde{b}_t for a sampled z_t, and encourage this \\tilde{b}_t to be similar to b_t, and also feed this \\tilde{b}_t to h_t. In this way, our model learns to implicitly use b_t during training as an input to h_t. This is different from Z-forcing where the model passes z_t to h_t while minimizing the KL divergence difference between the prior and posterior over z_t.\n\nAnother possible difference in your implementation could be that we suggest using stochastic backpropagation through the auxiliary costs.
