ALI-G retains the main advantage of SGD which is a low computational cost per iteration. But unlike SGD, the learning-rate of ALI-G uses a single constant hyper-parameter and does not require a decay schedule, which makes it considerably easier to tune. We provide convergence guarantees of ALI-G in the stochastic convex setting. Notably, all our convergence results tackle the realistic case where the interpolation property is satisfied up to some tolerance. We provide experiments on a variety of architectures and tasks: (i) learning a differentiable neural computer; (ii) training a wide residual network on the SVHN data set; (iii) training a Bi-LSTM on the SNLI data set; and (iv) training wide residual networks and densely connected networks on the CIFAR data sets. ALI-G produces state-of-the-art results among adaptive methods, and even yields comparable performance with SGD, which requires manually tuned learning-rate schedules.

In order to achieve that, they develop a stochastic extension of the Polyak step-size for the non-convex setting, namely the adaptive learning-rates for interpolation with gradients (ALI-G), in which the minimal value of the objective loss is set to 0 due to interpolation in neural networks and the learning rates are clipped by a chosen maximal value. The problem is formulated clearly, and the review on the Polyak step-size and related works are well done. Another main contribution of the paper is to provide the convergence guarantees for ALI-G in the convex setting where the objective loss is Lipschitz-continuous (Theorem 1 in the paper). Their theorem also takes into account the error in the estimate of the minimal value of the objective loss. In addition, they derive the connections between  ALI-G and SGD and show that compared to SGD, ALI-G take into consideration that the objective loss is non-negative and set the loss to 0 when it is negative. They perform empirical study to compare their algorithm with other methods including Adagrad, Adam, DFW, L4Adam and SGD on learning a differentiable neural computer, object recognition, and a natural language processing task. Their experimental results show that ALI-G performance is comparable with that of SGD with schedule learning rate.\n\nOverall, this paper could be an interesting contribution. However, some points in the theory and experiments need to be verified. I weakly reject this paper, but given these clarifications in an author response, I would be willing to increase the score. \n\nFor the algorithm and theory, there are some points that need to be verified and further clarification on novelty:\n\n1. When there are regularization such as the weight decay regularization, the minimal objective loss will not be 0. In such cases, Theorem 1 in the paper only guarantees that ALI-G reaches an objective loss less than or equal to a multiple of the estimate error \\epsilon of the true minimal objective loss. It cannot guarantee that the objective loss reached by ALI-G can converge to the true minimall objective loss. Furthermore, when training neural networks with, for example, the weight decay regularization, often times the value of the regularization loss, i.e.  the estimate error \\epsilon, is not small. Therefore, the upper bound given by Theorem 1 is rather loose. \n\n2.  The paper mentions that when no regularization is used, ALI-G and Deep Frank-Wolfe (DFW) are identical algorithms. The difference between the two algorithms are when regularization is used. However, given my concern for Theorem 1 above, the convergence of ALI-G and advantage of ALI-G over DFW in this setting is questionable, and the claim that \u201cALI-G can handle arbitrary (lower-bounded) loss functions\u201d also needs to be verified. \n\nFor the experiments, the following should be addressed:\n1. In the experiment with the differentiable neural computers, even though ALI-G obtains better performance for a large range of \\eta, its best objective loss is still worse than RMSProp, L4Adam, and L4Mom.\n\n2. Given the merit of Theorem 1 is that the convergence guarantee takes into account the estimate error of the minimal objective loss, an ablation study that compares ALI-G with other methods in the same setting with and without regularization are needed. For example, it would be more convincing if similar results to those in Table 2 or 3 but without regularization are provided and discussed.\n\n3. In Section 5.5, given that ALI-G and DFW are related, why is there no result for DFW in Figure \n4.?\n\n4.  As the paper mentions, AProx algorithm and ALI-G are related, why is there no comparison with AProx in the experiments?\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:\n1. In all experiments, the performance differences between ALI-G and competitive methods are small. Thus, error bars are needed for these results.\n\n2. In Table 3, the gap between SGD and ALI-G can be significantly different on different architectures. For example, in CIFAR-100 experiments, while ALI-G achieves the same result as SGD with the DenseNet, ALI-G\u2019s performance on Wide ResNet is much worse than SGD.

For each of the SVHN, SNLI and CIFAR tasks, SGD uses a schedule of the learning-rate that has been tuned by an experienced practitioner on the particular combination of dataset and architecture. More specifically, these schedules come from (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), (Conneau et al., 2017), and (Huang et al., 2017), each of which tuned the learning-rate schedule to obtain then state-of-the-art results with their model. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the strongest baseline available in the literature.\n\nWe do agree that in general SGD is difficult to tune, and this is a major motivation for this work. We hope to show that ALI-G alleviates this empirical difficulty in the interpolation setting by providing good performance while requiring little tuning.\n\n* \u201cThe settings where step size bigger than 1e+1 can hardly shows something, because the step-size is too big for SGD to converge.

Do you have any explanation for this?\u201d\n\nThe WRN architecture has a significantly larger number of parameters than the DN architecture (8M vs 2M). As a consequence, optimizers tend to overfit more easily on WRN, and SGD benefits more from the implicit regularization of its manually tuned schedule with many iterations at a large learning-rate.

As described in the paragraph \u201cRegularization\u201d in section 2.1, we express the regularization as a constraint on the feasible set rather than a soft penalty in the objective function. This allows us to realistically assume that even for regularized models, the minimal objective value is close to zero. This is verified in practice in our experiments, where regularized models achieve near zero objective value while remaining within the feasible set. Furthermore, please note that our theoretical results have also been proven for the constrained setting, i.e., no assumption is made regarding the feasible region other than the standard ones (convexity, availability of efficient projection algorithms).\n\n* \u201cthe claim that \u201cALI-G can handle arbitrary (lower-bounded) loss functions\u201d also needs to be verified.\u201d\n\nThe above answer shows that we can use arbitrary loss functions that have an infimum of 0.  In the more general case, if the loss function $\\ell$ is just lower-bounded, we can recover the previous case of an infimum of 0 by using the function shifted by a constant $\\ell - \\inf \\ell$, which does not change the solution of the problem (using $inf$ is well-defined because the function is real-valued and lower-bounded).\n\n* \u201cGiven the merit of Theorem 1 is that the convergence guarantee takes into account the estimate error of the minimal objective loss, an ablation study that compares ALI-G with other methods in the same setting with and without regularization are needed. For example, it would be more convincing if similar results to those in Table 2 or 3 but without regularization are provided and discussed.\u201d\n\nIn Tables 2 and 3, we focus on generalization performance, which is why we keep the regularization activated for a fair comparison between all methods. In contrast, sections 5.1 and 5.5 do not use l2 regularization because they focus on training performance, and section 5.3 does not either because the corresponding model from (Conneau et al., 2017) did not originally use any regularization. Thus our set of experiments arguably cover varied settings in terms of regularization.\n\n* \u201c In the experiment with the differentiable neural computers, even though ALI-G obtains better performance for a large range of \\eta, its best objective loss is still worse than RMSProp, L4Adam, and L4Mom.\u201d\n\nBy being more careful about numerical precision (a bottleneck for very accurate optimization on this task), we have been able to improve the performance of ALI-G. ALI-G, the L4 methods and RMSProp obtain approximately the same performance -- the difference is insignificant due to the limit of numerical precision on single-float numbers. We have updated the results and added a comment about numerical precision.\n\n* \u201cIn Section 5.5, given that ALI-G and DFW are related, why is there no result for DFW in Figure 4.?\u201d\n\nThis is because DFW does not support the use of the cross-entropy loss, and therefore its performance cannot be fairly compared on a cross-entropy objective function.\n\n* \u201cAs the paper mentions, AProx algorithm and ALI-G are related, why is there no comparison with AProx in the experiments?\u201d\n\nThe aProx algorithm coincides with the ALI-G algorithm when the exponential decay rate of aProx is set to zero. In the general case, this decay rate is an additional hyper-parameter that has to be chosen by the user (which adds to the tuning burden of tuning hyper-parameters). This work shows that this hyper-parameter can be avoided since ALI-G provides good performance in practice without needing to tune it \u2014 this is also visible in our convergence results that do not require it either. In other words, ALI-G shows that a simplified version of aProx with one fewer hyper-parameter provides good performance in practice.

Indeed, rephrasing Proposition 1, ALI-G can be seen as an extension of SGD which exploits the fact that the loss is non-negative to adapt its learning-rate. When the interpolation property is satisfied, this knowledge is useful for convergence of the algorithm, because the lower bound of zero corresponds to the minimum value that can be attained. When the interpolation property is not satisfied, the lower bound is too loose to be useful and therefore ALI-G behaves exactly like non-adaptive SGD.\n\n* \u201cI think section 2.2. could benefit from a short motivational introduction\u201d\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the useful suggestion, we have updated the paper accordingly.", "title": "Response to Review #2"}, "B1lwP1oqiH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJgm9PbTqH", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for their detailed comments, which we answer below:\n\n* \u201c[...] but it seems like there are other types of losses that don\u2019t necessarily to go 0.

In contrast, the Polyak step-size, which does not exploit interpolation, would use $f(w_t)$ and $\\nabla f(w_t)$ to compute the learning-rate (exact / non-stochastic computation over all training samples). This constitutes a major computational advantage of ALI-G over the usual Polyak step-size. We have added the above clarification in the new version of the paper.\n\n* On novelty:\n\nBeyond our theoretical analysis \u2014 which required a significant amount of work by itself, it is important to note that ALI-G requires only one hyper-parameter instead of four for L4. Since hyper-parameter sweeps are often the computational bottleneck for applied machine learning (the cost of extensive tuning grows exponentially with the number of hyper-parameters), this constitutes a considerable advantage for practical applications.\n\nIn addition, L4 is sensitive to noise,which makes it very difficult to tune: we observed in practice that L4 sometimes fails to learn anything or even diverges in some cases \u2014 similar issues have been reported in (Vaswani et al., 2019b). In contrast, ALI-G consistently provides reliable optimization in the interpolation setting at considerably less tuning cost.
