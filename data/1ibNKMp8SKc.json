One path to achieve this is to learn meaningful and compact representations, in which different semantic aspects of data are structurally disentangled. The focus of disentanglement approaches has been on separating independent factors of variation despite the fact that real-world observations are often not structured into meaningful independent causal variables. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world scenarios by analyzing the behavior of most prominent methods and disentanglement scores on correlated data in a large scale empirical study (including 4260 models). We show that systematically induced correlations in the dataset are being learned and reflected in the latent representations, while widely used disentanglement scores fall short of capturing these latent correlations. Finally, we demonstrate how to disentangle these latent correlations using weak supervision, even if we constrain this supervision to be causally plausible. Our results thus support the argument to learn independent mechanisms rather than independent factors of variations.", "keywords": ["representation learning", "disentanglement"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This submission considers the problem of learning disentangled representations from data in which there are correlations between underlying factors of variation (FoVs). Much of the work on learning disentangled representations has considered simulated datasets in which the FoVs are conditionally independent. The authors perform an extensive experimental evaluation (4000+ trained models). The main findings of this evaluation are that:\n\n- Existing methods fail to disentangle when ground truth FoVs are correlated, in the sense that learned factors will reflect the correlations in the training data\n- Metrics for disentanglement do not necessarily reveal correlations in underlying factors\n- Semi-supervision and weak supervision can be used to induce learned factors that align with true FoVs\n\nReviewers expressed diverging opinions on this paper:\n\n- R2 is a favor of acceptance, but does note that the paper is somewhat difficult to follow, owing to the fact that it presents a large number of results and does not quite arrive at a streamlined narrative.\n\n- R4 was initially critical and posted detailed comments relating to framing, interpretation of existing work, and the conclusions that can be drawn from the presented experiments. The authors were able to address a number of these concerns in a detailed discussion with the reviewer. \n\n- R3 is critical of the experimental setup, which considers linear correlations between two underlying factors, and feels the semi-supervised and weakly supervised experiments have limited novelty. This reviewer did not respond to author feedback. \n\nThe metareviewer has carefully read the reviews, author feedback, and subsequent discussion. Owing to the fact that reviews are diverging the meteareviewer also read the paper. \n\nAs R4 notes, the results in this paper are in some sense unsurprising \u2013 we would expect correlations between underlying factors to lead to correlated learned factors. In fact one could even argue that dimensions in the latent space should reflect correlations in the training data. That said, the metareviewer feels that a paper need not present results that are surprising, as long as the experimental evaluation is rigorous and there are no major problems with framing and exposition. \n\nIn this context, the metareviewer would like to express their appreciation to R4 for taking the time to follow up in detail with the authors, and for checking their revisions. The metareviewer feels that the fact that these revisions have a fairly large edit distance should not in itself not impede acceptance, as long as reviewers are agree that the edits improve the paper. \n\nThe metareviewer is not entirely convinced by the criticisms presented by R3. The reviewer is of course correct that real-world datasets will not just have linear correlations between two factors. That said, an experimental evaluation of how correlations affect the degree of disentanglement has to start somewhere, and even these comparatively simple experiments represent a substantial effort on the part of the authors. \n\nHaving read the submission, the metareviewer agrees with R2s assessment that the exposition is difficult to follow, even for readers who know the relevant literature. As the reviewer notes, the overall narrative could be clearer. Extracting a clear narrative is challenging when there are many experiments to report, but it is nonetheless something that the authors should spend additional time and thought on. Another factor that hurts clarity is that experiments are described in long paragraphs that often would benefit from an equation or two, for example to describe the substitution function in Section 4.1, or to more precisely describe the form of weak supervision that the authors employ in Section 4.2. \n\nAs a final note, the metareviewer would suggest more explicit discussion on what authors think a VAE *should* do when factors are correlated. Arguably learning factors that reflect correlations is the \"correct\" when the training data exhibits such correlations. Currently the authors do not provide much of an arguments for *why* they think a VAE should learn a representation that ignores these correlations. A possible argument is that train-time correlations might not be representative of test-time correlations. Here, testing to what extent a learned representation generalizes to test-time data with a shift in correlation would also strengthen results.\n\nOn balance, the metareviewer's assessment is that this paper falls narrowly below the threshold for acceptance. While the experimental evaluation represents a substantial effort that in itself is above the bar, there are problems with narrative and the clarity of  writing that rise above the level of minor revisions that could be addressed by camera ready without additional review. Based on this, the metareviewer will recommend rejection. With a little bit more work on writing and exposition, this will make a great paper at a future conference.

The paper shows how the correlation in the FoV is reflected in the representations learned by the models, and claims that the widely used disentanglement scores fail to capture these correlations. A couple of solutions that use weak supervision are suggested.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper attempts to address an important limitation of current unsupervised disentangling methods, in that they assume independent FoV. I agree that this is an unrealistic assumption, and only holds for the synthetic datasets used in the literature.\n2. The experimental evaluation of the paper is extensive\n3. The paper is presented clearly for the most part.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. At the beginning of Section 3.2, the claim that the existing disentanglement metrics fail to capture correlations in the training data seems flawed. Figure 2, that the violin plots of metrics for 180 models (with different loss/hyperparam combinations/random seed) shows no clear trend, is used as evidence for the claim. However this argument ignores an important confounding factor, which is the behaviour of the models (trained with losses originally designed for data with independent FoV) when trained on a dataset with correlated FoV. Without understanding the behaviour of models after training, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from Figure 2. Moreover comparing violin plots of all 180 models does not seem sensible - the models with poor disentangling performance will likely be uninformative, creating noise for comparisons between different settings. Hence I think it makes more sense to compare results for the top models for a given metric (as is done in Fig3).\n2. I also have doubts regarding the conclusion itself, that all existing metrics fail to capture correlations in the training data. I think this only holds for some metrics and not for others. Suppose the representations that we are evaluating are the ground truth FoV values. Then the BetaVAE and FactorVAE metrics will give a perfect score regardless of the degree of correlation by design. But the MIG/SAP/DCI scores will be lower for higher correlation in the FoV, since the mutual information/prediction accuracy between the two correlated factors will be higher than between uncorrelated factors. \n3. The result presented by Figure 3, that training disentanglement models on strongly correlated data gives representations encoding mixtures of the correlated FoV, is unsurprising in my opinion, and adds little value to the pool of knowledge in the literature.\n4. In Section 2, I think that the statement \u201cit has been shown that purely unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is impossible (Locatello et al., 2019b)\u201d is a wrong interpretation of Locatello et al. They show that optimising marginal likelihood in a generative model (such as a VAE) cannot achieve disentangling without any inductive biases in the model. But the inductive biases in the models used by disentangling methods, along with the loss (that is a variant of the ELBO and not the marginal likelihood), are what allow disentangling in practice. There are also theoretical works such as [1] that explain this behaviour.\n5. In Section 3.2, the conclusion \u201cThese results suggest that we cannot expect disentangled representations learned unsupervisedly to help reduce unfairness beyond the benefits discussed in Locatello et al. (2019a)\u201d seems problematic. It\u2019s not the unsupervised learning that\u2019s problematic, rather it\u2019s the model assumption that the FoV are independent that is problematic in the scenario of correlated FoV, which is an unsurprising conclusion. \n6. The conclusion in Section 3.3, that disentanglement methods can generalize towards unseen FoV configurations, is old news that is already shown in the literature in disentanglement models trained on datasets with an incomplete set of FoV configurations e.g. 3D Faces, CelebA\n7. In Section 4.2, the claim \u201cThis kind of extra knowledge is often available at no cost , e.g., in temporarily close frames from a video of a moving robot arm where some factors remain unchanged\u201d is unjustified. We still need to know the number of factors that have changed, which usually requires human labelling\n8. The weak supervision for the correlated FoV when applying Ada-GVAE relies on being able to generate data where the correlation is broken, which seems like an unrealistic assumption. The authors seem to address this by assuming a causal relation between the two factors. However even if there is a causal relation between the two factors (C1 causes C2), the correlation implies that some (C1,C2) pairs are very unlikely to appear in the data, so you cannot \u201csample any value in C1\u201d given C2. Hence I don\u2019t understand how the causal setting at the end of Section 4.2 helps address the problems of having to generate data where the correlation is broken.\n\nOverall the paper does address an important problem in the disentanglement literature, but the conclusions drawn from the extensive evaluation are either unsurprising or unjustified. Moreover, the proposed solution via weak supervision appears flawed because it requires generating data where the correlation is broken, a very unrealistic assumption.\n\nOther points:\n- Typo in Figure 2 caption: \u201clower \\sigma indicates less correlation\u201d <- \u201chigher \\sigma indicates less correlation\u201d\n- Section 3.1: \u201cP(z_c1, z_c2) ~ N(z_c2 - \\alpha z_c1, \\sigma)\u201d How does the RHS define a joint distribution?

In the following we would like to address your comments hoping they will clarify raised concerns:\n\n1.) We agree that conclusion from looking at the violin plots only without understanding the behavior of the models can be misleading, but in the remainder of this section we extensively study this on a pairwise level. When utilizing these insights we can draw the conclusion about usefulness of the metrics in hindsight. We tried to clarify this in the updated version.\n\n2.) We agree that BetaVAE and FactorVAE will give a perfect score if you would take the ground truth correlated representations for their computation. Thank you for pointing out this fact. We updated the paragraph accordingly. As we see in many of our trained models, the BetaVAE score is showing perfect disentanglement even if the latent space is rotated, i.e. the model in Fig 3 has beta score 1 but traversals are entangled. This should be an argument in support of our conclusion. The other scores measure MI and prediction accuracy in the latent codes but as can be seen from Fig 10/11 they do not show this trend along different correlation strengths in our setting. Still, we see these persisting correlations in the pairwise metrics.\n\n3.) Although the fact that models learn representations that encode mixtures of the correlated FoV might be unsurprising we are not aware of literature that showed this in a large-scale empirical study across a wide range of disentanglement methods. Therefore we considered it important to investigate this as it (a) validates these intuitions and (b) bases this conclusion on extensive experimental results.\n\n4.) We agree that we missed mentioning the inductive bias aspect in the interpretation of the non-identifiability result. Thanks for pointing that out. We updated that in our paper. In practice, however, the biases of the disentangling methods are insufficient to reliably produce disentangled representations (see Fig 2, 4 center, 5 in the original ICML paper).\n\n5.) The objective of many disentanglement learners is to learn independent explanatory FoV. Locatello et al. (2019a) showed that this is beneficial in terms of fairness with respect to a protected variable in the independent setting. In fairness settings, however, the target and sensitive variables are typically correlated. If we expect disentanglement learners to learn an independent factorization of correlated FoV then this should be helpful for fairness. We agree that it is true that the conclusion might seem unsurprising but only once you know that the disentangled learners cannot disentangle this correlation. Additionally,  we show that this notion of fairness based on a total variation measure is another pairwise metric to uncover the remaining correlations in the latent space.\n\n6.) While we agree that there are some interesting models that indicate generalization to factor combinations on incomplete sets, the true FoVs are generally unknown. We do not want to claim novelty in this observation but consider this behavior of the models an important insight as we do not think this kind of generalization towards unseen FoV configurations with zero probability in the prior is being generally considered solved by the community. We want to note that reviewer 2 finds this behavior interesting.\n\n7.) We decided to investigate this particular method of weak supervision in our correlated setting as an example due to its recent popularity within the line of methods that learn disentanglement with identifiability guarantees. It is true that this form of weak supervision might require some form of human labeling but only knowing that some factors differ without knowing which specifically as well as their labels is substantially weaker. We guess it is also worth noting that Locatello showed this method is likewise working for k>1 or k=random, which seems natural to assume for temporary close frames. However, we understand that this might be not easy to achieve in every setting why we decided to tone down the corresponding claim.\n\n8.) If there is a causal relationship between C1 and C2, specifically C1 causes C2, then it is true that it is very unlikely to observe some (C1, C2) pairs in the observational distribution. However, this is not the case anymore if one can intervene upon the variables, thereby generating samples from an interventional distribution. So if we intervene on C2, the causal link is removed and C1 is independent. We want to emphasize that the vast majority of pairs in this setting still exhibits these correlations and only in rare cases (where k corresponds to C2) we will sample some of these pairs.\n\n9.) Why doesn\u2019t entanglement decrease with #labels>100 in Fig6?\nLinear regression only needs a small number of labels to learn the optimal parameter for rotation and any additional labels will have no substantial additional benefit.

We appreciate your comment that we studied a problem worth paying attention to and the large number of experimental studies could support our conclusions. We feel the reviewers\u2019 main concerns might be due to some degree of misunderstanding of the main contributions and novelty of such an extensive empirical study on inductive data biases on disentanglement learners with implications on fairness in particular and want to address your main concerns in the following.\n\nConcern (1): \u2018The design of induced correlation is too simple. As you have mentioned in related work, there were some papers that noticed the too ideal assumptions of traditional VAE-based models which may not be held in practice. IMO, the linear dependency between only two variables is far from reality as well. More complicated settings should be involved.\u2019\n\nWe would like to emphasize that our primary goal and contribution is to study the behavior of disentanglement learners on correlated data systematically. Even though we acknowledge the fact that there is work done that indicates the need to study this problem, it is typically addressed in much smaller experiments not covering as many different methods (as detailed in the related work). This does not allow for drawing broader conclusions about this problem. We study this setting along with multiple datasets, multiple SOTA disentanglement learners, and random seeds. Additionally, we cover a systematic study with complete control and knowledge of the correlations present. \n\nRegarding more complicated settings: With a limited compute budget in mind, we decided to base this study on pairwise linear correlation as we can intuitively control and understand the correlation and also use this understanding for subsequent analysis of the latent space. This is already leading to an extensive number of models as is being acknowledged in the beginning of your review. Linear correlations are an important first step in studying this problem, and it already indicates several shortcomings, as discussed in the paper. It is not straightforward to come up with more complicated settings as the correlation variations would grow exponentially, e.g. when studying multiple variable correlations. Additionally, it is unclear how one could systematically analyze and understand the latent spaces of models in these (potentially even nonlinear) scenarios. Moreover, the compute required for the experiments is already significant (0.72 GPU years) and a tradeoff regarding additional insights should be taken into account. We are happy to add a more concrete experiment with nonlinear settings but would kindly ask for a concrete proposal (feasible within the rebuttal time-period) since the multiple variable nonlinear setting is too huge as a search space. \n\nConcern (2): \u2018In line with the former limitation, diagnostics of the potential entanglement should also not be limited to pairwise level, which cannot scale up to high dimensional latent factors.\u2019\n\nWhen studying settings with pairwise correlations in the ground truth factor, it makes sense to study the latent space on a pairwise level to obtain fine-grained insight into corresponding latent spaces. Additionally, we do not only study pairwise metrics but also five commonly used disentanglement scores utilizing the full latent space. We would appreciate, if the reviewers could elaborate on what they mean by \u2018scale up to high dimensional latent factors\u2019? Disentanglement learning aims to learn a *low-dimensional* set of explanatory factors of variation of high-dimensional (observational) data.\n\nConcern (3): \u2018The novelty of Section 4 is somewhat limited as all the correction methods and even some conclusions were proposed by the previous work.\u2019\n\nWe want to point out that our primary goal is to validate the applicability of a significant line of work on disentanglement to more realistic scenarios where factors of variation are not independent. That is why we cover not only the unsupervised setting but also a popular weakly supervised method in disentanglement learning. Regarding the correction methods investigated in section 4: We are not aware of other work studying the fast adaptation method on pairs of entangled latent factors (section 4.1).
