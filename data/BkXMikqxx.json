If anything, it is psychology/cognitive science inspired, in the sense that open bigrams appear to help for word recognition (Touzet et al. 2014). But the implied cortical characteristics, implicitly referred to e.g. by pointing to analogies between deep neural nets for object recognition and in that case the visual cortex, is unfounded. \n\nOur title is: \"Cortical inspired open-bigram representation for handwritten word recognition\".  \"Cortical inspired\" refers to the hypothesis that there exists a map (or layer) in the cortex that is devoted to code for bigrams.\nIt is true that we know about this hypothesis thanks to cognitive psychology experiments and models, but it seems more logical to refer to the subject's study (bigrams' map) instead of the research domain (cognitive prychology). As for the recurrent question about the legitimacy of a cortical map (or layer) devoted to code for bigrams, recent results (Glasser 2015) establish that the cortex is made of about 360 maps (180 per hemisphere), and that indeed there is a igram representation (Vinckier 2011). It is enough to get the inspiration that one of this 360 maps codes for bigrams...\n\n- Glasser, M. F., Coalson, T., Robinson, E., Hacker, C., Harwell, J., Yacoub, E., ... & Smith, S. M. (2015).

Dehaene's work is a proposal, so you'll need to describe more \"findings in cognitive neurosciences [sic] research on reading\" (p. 8) to substantiate those claims. \n\nYes, there are direct evidences (Vinckier 2011, Grainger 2014).\n\n- Vinckier, Fabien, Emilie Qiao, Christophe Pallier, Stanislas Dehaene & Laurent Cohen (2011).

We don't claim that all deep neural nets need five hidden layers, but rather that the number of layers is larger than one or two. I agree that this sentence is misleading, we will reformulate the analogy.\n\n> Unless I misunderstand something, you are specifically referring to Krizhevsky's AlexNet here (which you should probably have cited there)? \n\nNo, not specifically. LeNet-5 is another example, the RNNs for handwriting recognition by Graves (2008) too.\n\n> I hope you don't mean to imply that all deep neural nets need five layers. \n\nWe don't. \n\n> It is also not true that ten is \"quite close to the number of layers of an efficient deep NN\" -- what network? what task? etc.\n\nWell, most deep nets in the litterature (for computer vision, speech recognition, ...) have between 5 and 15 layers. \nOf course, it depends on the task.\nWe will reformulate the analogy between the cortex and deep (artificial) neural networks.\n\n\n> - The model is not clearly explained. There is a short paragraph in Appendix A.3. that roughly describes the setup, \n\nWe will extend A.3 to provide more details\n\n> but this does not include e.g. the objective function,\n\nSect. 4.2 : \"We trained one RNN for each order-d bigram, with the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC (Graves et al.,2006)) criterion. [...] The CTC training criterion optimizes the Negative Log-Likelihood~(NLL) of the correct label sequence. We set the learning rate to 0.001, [...]\"\n\n> or answer why the network output is only considered each two consecutive time steps, rather than at each time step (or so it seems?). \n\nI guess you refer to \"The first LSTM layers have 100 hidden LSTM units. The outputs of two consecutive timesteps of both directions are fed to a feed-forward layer with 100 nodes,\". We will reformulate : the \"outputs\" there are the outputs of the first BLSTM ; the \"two consecutive timesteps\" allow a subsampling, but both timesteps are used as inputs of the next layer. We will clarify this in a more detailed version of A.3.\n\n\n> This is probably because the paper argues that it \"is focused on the decoder\" (p. 6), rather than on the whole problem. \n\nWe present a system for the whole problem of recognizing words from a visual input. The novelty only lies in the decoder so we decided to focus the paper on the decoder. We will add more details on the neural networks in appendix A.3. but this part won't contain any scientific contribution.\n\n> I find this problematic, because in that case we're effectively measuring how easy it is to reconstruct a word from its open bigrams\n\nThe motivation of this approach lies in theories of reading mechanisms in the brain (i.e. reconstruct a word from a visual input). \nOpen bigrams are a way of representing the words (alternative to character sequences).  \nWe will add the results of the decoder only, i.e. assume we know already the open-bigrams to measure how easy it is to reconstruct a word from its open bigrams \n\n> which has very little to do with handwriting recognition \n\nOffline handwriting recognition consists in recognizing words from a visual input. \n\n> (it could have been evaluated on any text corpus). In fact, as the example on page 4 shows, handwriting is not necessary to illustrate the open bigram hypothesis. Which leads me to wonder why these particular tasks were chosen, if we are only interested in the decoding mechanism?\n\nThey were chosen because they are \"reading\" tasks. Indeed, a text corpus could be used to evaluate the decoder, but in that case the open-bigrams will be known perfectly, and I fear that the results would be too high to have an interest, just like evaluating a prefix tree decoder on a text corpus would have a limited interest.\n\n\n> - The comparison is not really fair. The Viterbi decoder only has access to unigrams, as far as I can tell. The only model that does better than that baseline has access to a lot more information, and does not do that much better. \n\nThe Viterbi decoder also has access to all character positions and ordering. The OB decoder only knows which bigrams are present, but not the order, count, or position.\n\n> Did the Viterbi model have access to the word boundary information (at one point rather confusingly called \"extremities\") that pushed the open bigram model over the edge in terms of performance? \n\nOf course. The Viterbi decoder sees a sequence of prediction, so the first character prediction is also the first boundary. \n\n> Why is there no comparison to e.g. rnn_0,1' (unigram+bigram+boundary markers)? \nWe added the comparisons with different orders (Table 7).\n\n\n> The dataset also appears to be biased in favor of the proposed approach (longer words, only ). \nThat is not true. See added figures 5 and 7.\n\n> I am not convinced that this paper really shows that open bigrams help. I very much like the idea of the paper, but I am simply not convinced by its claims.\n\nNote that we don't claim that the OB decoder is a better choice than the sequential decoder. Even though we sometimes got better empirical results, we conclude by saying that the approach is viable, and that it is possible to recognize words with a decoder operating on the OB representation.\n", "title": "Answers to AnonReviewer3"}, "SkTgl9vHe": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkG_8jUVe", "comment": "Thanks for the feedback and relevant comments.\n\n> - No comparison to previous state of the art, only with author-generated results. \n\nNo fair comparison is possible since we limited ourselves to ([a-z]+) words. \nMoreover, we don't claim to improve handwriting recognition with this method, but rather to learn a representation of words inspired from neuroscience, and to build a decoder operative on that representation.\n\n\n> - More ablation studies needed -- i.e. fill in Table3 with rnn0,1 rnn0,1,2 rnn0,1' etc etc. It is not clear where the performance is coming from, as it seems that it is single character modelling (0) and word endings (') that are actually beneficial.\n\nWe will add those experiments and results.\n\n> - While the use of Open bigrams is novel, there are works which use bag of bigrams and ngrams as models which are not really compared to or explored.

We chose the words written with lowercase letters and single-letter words.

The distribution of word lengths of filtered words will be added in the appendices.\n\n\n> I do see the motivation for introducing open-bigrams in an unordered way due to the corresponding evidence from cognitive research.

It would be interesting to see an experiment, where only the use of the order is varied, to differentiate the effect of the order from the effect of other aspects of the approach.\n\nThe goal of this research paper was to evaluate a decoder based on the findings in cognitive research. We wanted to focus on the ability to recognize a word from a set of unordered bigram predictions. Thus the order is not expected to be present or available at any point. At the implementation level, we use RNNs with a notion of order, but this is not the focus of the paper. In the ideal case (in the hypothesis that reading is achieved via bigram coding and not explicit ordering), the recognition system should output a set of bigram and not model the order. \n\nHowever, in Table 6 (prev. Table 5), we report the edit distance (in character/bigram sequences) and sequence error rate (~= word error rates) when only the order is varied.\n\n\n> End of page 1: \"whole language method\" - please explain what is meant by this.\n\nThe \"whole language\" method is a teaching method for learning how to read (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_language), often opposed to the phonics method.\nTo simplify, in the former method, children are taught to focus on the word globally, whereas in the latter, they learn to associate phonemes with graphemes, or spelling.\n\n\n> Page 6: define your notation for rnn_d(x,t).\nAdded.\n\n> The number of target for the RNNs modeling order 0 (unigrams effectively) and the RNNs modeling order 1 and larger are very much different.

As far as I understand this applies to both baseline/standard and open-bigram approach, right? \n\nThat is correct\n\n> What would be the performance of the baseline model when using a language model?\n\nBoth models would benefit from a language model, although the benefits would depend on the corpus on which they are estimated. In (Bluche et al. 2013) we observed about 15% reduction of the error rate with a language model. On text lines (Bluche, 2015) we get about 25% improvement.\n\n> For your comparative experiments you use only 70% of the data by choosing longer words only. On the other hand, it is well known that the shorter words are more prone to result in misrecognitions. The question is, if this choice is advantageous for one of the tasks, or not. Can you comment on this?\n\nIn both cases, there are more errors for short words.\nHowever, I should point out that we did not choose the 70% longer words. We discarded words of length 1 (<< 30% of data) and words containing capital letters, punctuation/apostrophes, and accents.\n\n> I do see the motivation for introducing open-bigrams in an unordered way due to the corresponding evidence from cognitive research. However, decision theoretically I wonder, why the order should be given up, if the underlying sequential classification problem clearly is of a monotonous nature. Ignoring the sequential order, words being anagram of each other would only be distinguishable via their probability of occurrence. Even if including word boundary symbols into the open-bigrams, anagrams indistinguishable from unordered open-bigrams would remain, e.g. in English: \"parental\" vs. \"paternal\". Did you check the performance of a combination of your bigram features with an ordered generation/search process?\n\nOur goal was to evaluate a \u201cpure\u201d open bigrams approach. Therefore, we didn't try to improve the performance of our unordered bigrams model by introducing additional ordered information (apart from the boundary symbols). \nIt is true that anagrams are then indistinguishable. Getting into the details of biological vision, cognitive psychology told us that the quality of image depends on the distance to the eye focus point (viewing position effect - usually a little on the left of the middle of the word). Long words may require 2 eye saccades, i.e., two different focus points. By taking into account this parameter (letter distance to the focus point), it is then possible to code bigrams with continuous values ([0,1]) instead of \u201cAbsent/Present\u201d ({0,1}). Anagrams would then become distinguishable. \n\nMoreover, the RNNs are trained with CTC to output the bigrams of a given order sequentially. In Appendix B.2, the edit distance between predicted and true sequences of bigrams, and the sequence error are reported on Table 5 and correspond to an ordered search.\n\n> The number of target for the RNNs modeling order 0 (unigrams effectively) and the RNNs modeling order 1 and larger are very much different.

However, from the perspective of the decoder, they indicate the difficulty to some extend (more errors to be corrected by the open-bigram decoder).

For this work we selected the network architecture offering a good compromise between performance and complexity. We can probably get better results with larger models and more data, but we decided to focus the paper on validating the decoding approach.\n\n> Also, when comparing the standard approach with the open-bigram approach: what is the number of parameters in each case?

At least, the column for order 0 should be visually separated to highlight this.\n\n\nMinor comments: a spell check is recommended\np. 2: state-of-art -> state-of-the-art\np. 2: predict character sequence -> predict a character sequence\np. 3, top: Their approach include -> Their approach includes\np. 3, top: an handwritten -> a handwritten\np. 3, bottom: consituent -> constituent\np. 4, top: in classical approach -> in the classical approach\np. 4, top: transformed in a vector -> transformed into a vector\np. 5: were build -> were built\nReferences: first authors name written wrongly: Thodore Bluche -> Theodore Bluche\n", "title": "Various questions concerning modeling and evaluation", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}}}
