Neural network architectures, on the other hand, have proven track records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training objective for neural networks, Neural Graph Machines, for combining the power of neural networks and label propagation. The new objective allows the neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a) allowing the network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b) biasing the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs. The proposed method is experimentally validated on a wide range of tasks (multi- label classification on social graphs, news categorization and semantic intent classification) using different architectures (NNs, CNNs, and LSTM RNNs).", "keywords": ["Semi-Supervised Learning", "Natural language processing", "Applications"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper is an interesting contribution, primarily in its generalization of Weston's et al's work on semi-supervised embedding method.

However we would like to respond, make further clarifications and show new results (see comment #3 below) that should address all reviewer concerns.\n\n1. Response to all reviewers\n\nThis work generalizes the Weston et al.\u2019s work on semi-supervised embedding and extends it to new settings (for example, when only graph inputs & no features are available). Unlike the previous works, we show that the graph augmented training method can work with multiple neural network architectures (Feed Forward NNs, CNNs, RNNs) and on multiple prediction tasks & datasets using \"natural\" as well as \"constructed\" graphs. The experiment results clearly show the effectiveness of this method in all these different settings. Besides the methodology, our study also presents an important contribution towards assessing the effectiveness of graph+neural networks as a generic training mechanism for different architectures & problems, which was not well studied in previous papers. We can add more clarifications in our paper to emphasize this point more clearly. \n\nFurthermore, the reviewers\u2019 concerns should also be addressed with details in comment #3 (please see below), where we show new experiments and direct comparison results against Weston et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016 [2] and other graph methods. \n\n2. Regarding reviewer #2\u2019s comment about accuracy comparison against Zhang et al., 2015.\n\nWe would like to make it clear to the reviewers that the numbers reported on this task (Table 3 in our paper) for the \u201csmall CNN\u201d baseline were obtained from their paper (Zhang et al., 2015 refers to this as \u201cSmall ConvNet\u201d which uses 6 layers). They use far deeper and more complex networks (wrt frame size, hidden units) to achieve the reported accuracies on this task.\nIn comparison, NGM trained with a simple 3-layer CNN achieves much better results (86.90 vs 84.35/85.20) and also produces comparable results to their best 9-layer Large ConvNet. This shows that our graph augmented training method not only achieves better results but also helps train more efficient, compressible networks.\n\n3. Response to all reviewers \u2014 regarding comparison against Weston et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016 [2] and other graph methods. This, along with experiments already detailed in the paper, should address all the concerns raised about how the new method performs in comparison to previous works.\n\nWe performed new experiments and compare our method on a new task with very limited supervision \u2014 the PubMed document classification task [1]. The task is to classify each document into one of 3 classes, with each document being described by a TF-IDF weighted word vector. The graph is available as a citation network: two documents are connected to each other if one cites the other. The graph has 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, with each class having 20 seed nodes and 1000 test nodes. In our experiments we exclude the test nodes from the graph entirely, training only on the labeled and unlabeled nodes.\n\nWe train a feed-forward network with two hidden layers with 250 and 100 neurons, using the l2 distance metric on the last hidden layer. The NGM model is trained with alpha_i = 0.2, while the baseline is trained with alpha_i = 0 (i.e., a supervised-only model). We use self-training to train the model, starting with just the 60 seed nodes as training data. The amount of\u00a0 training data is iteratively increased by assigning labels to the immediate neighbors of the labeled nodes, and retraining the model.\n\nWe compare the final NGM model against the baseline, the Planetoid models (Yang et. al, 2016 [2]), semi-supervised embedding (SemiEmb) (Weston et. al, 2012), manifold regression (ManiReg) (Belkin et. al, 2006), transductive SVM (TSVM), label propagation (LP) and other methods. The results show that the NGM model (without any \u201ctuning\u201d) outperforms the baseline, semi-supervised embedding, manifold regularization and Planetoid-G/Planetoid-T, and compares favorably with the other Planetoid system. We believe that with tuning, NGM accuracy can be improved even further.\n\n\nTable: Results for Pubmed document classification\n\nFeat*              0.698\nSemiEmb*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   0.711\u2028\nManiReg*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   0.707\n\u2028Planetoid-I*\u00a0   0.772\nTSVM*            0.622\u2028\nLP*                 0.630\n\u2028GraphEmb*    0.653\u2028\nPlanetoid-G*\u00a0 0.664\u2028\nPlanetoid-T*   0.757\n\n\u2028------------------------------------\u2028\nFeed forward NN (similar to Feat)\u00a0\u00a0 0.709\u2028\nNGM\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.759\n\n*numbers reported in Table 3 from Yang et al., 2016 \n\n\n[1]: Sen, Prithviraj, Namata, Galileo, Bilgic, Mustafa, Getoor, Lise, Galligher, Brian, and Eliassi-Rad, Tina.

Even so, the model (TinyCNN with NGM) described in our paper trains much faster and still produces results on par with the performance of a significantly larger network by Zhang et al (\"Large ConvNet\"), which has an accuracy of 87.18 without using a thesaurus, and 86.61 with the thesaurus.

We are fully aware of the work of Weston et al. (2012) and would like to clarify our contributions: \n1. We show that graph-augmented training works for a variety of neural network models (FF, CNN and LSTM RNN) and yields improvements over strong baselines.\n2. This can be used for model compression, e.g. CNN with 3 layers using graph loss performs as well as CNN with 9 layers.\n3. We show that the objective works with real-world graphs (with or without input features). Weston et al. (2012) constructs the graphs on the fly using nearest neighbours -- this is rather ad-hoc. In fact, we have not been able to reproduce the results obtained by Weston et al.

Similarity to aforementioned papers: Thanks for the pointer to both papers.\nThe research thread similar to Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings is orthogonal to our approach. \nThe aforementioned paper in particular attempts to learn an embedding for graph nodes based on neighbourhood information in a similar spirit to word2vec. In contrast, we provide a graph-augmented objective for learning that works with different types of neural networks (FF, CNN, LSTM) and also show improvements over these strong neural network baselines for several different tasks. \n\nThis paper also re-uses a random walk based context sampling introduced in DeepWalk. Recent work from Grover & Leskovec (2016) shows that node2vec produces better embeddings and significant improvements over DeepWalk, LINE, etc. for multi-label classification on graphs. Hence, we compare against this stronger baseline (node2vec) in our experiments. Please see the paragraph at the end of section 1 for further differences to prior work.\n\n2. Stronger baselines\nWe don\u2019t think we fully understand your question. We compared our methods against relevant state-of-the-art models for tasks 4.2 and 4.3, and a baseline which does use the adjacency matrix as inputs but not the edge information in task 4.1 [note that there are *no* input features for this task]. For task 4.1, the node2vec baseline that we compare against is a \u201csupervised approach\u201d (the approach learns node-level features/embeddings using the graph and subsequently trains a supervised classifier for prediction).
