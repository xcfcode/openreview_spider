", "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural Variational Inference allowed for a renaissance in latent variable models in a variety of domains involving high-dimensional data. In this paper, we introduce two generic Variational Inference frameworks for generative models of Knowledge Graphs; Latent Fact Model and Latent Information Model.  While traditional variational methods derive an analytical approximation for the intractable distribution over the latent variables, here we construct an inference network conditioned on the symbolic representation of entities and relation types in the Knowledge Graph, to provide the variational distributions. The new framework can create models able to discover underlying probabilistic semantics for the symbolic representation by utilising parameterisable distributions which permit training by back-propagation in the context of neural variational inference, resulting in a highly-scalable method. Under a Bernoulli sampling framework, we provide an alternative justification for commonly used techniques in large-scale stochastic variational inference, which drastically reduces training time at a cost of an additional approximation to the variational lower bound.  The generative frameworks are flexible enough to allow training under any prior distribution that permits a re-parametrisation trick, as well as under any scoring function that permits maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters. Experiment results display the potential and efficiency of this framework by improving upon multiple benchmarks with Gaussian prior representations.

Regarding the raised issues; \n\n*The focus of our work is on comparison to prior generative knowledge base models, not on beating SotA neural link prediction methods. We have shown increased performance against previous generative approaches while laying future support for incorporating variational inference techniques with statistical relational learning. That lack of FB15K results in Table 2 was due to the FB15K results not being reported in the referenced articles. \n\n*We have now added in a more explicit description of the underlying assumptions of each model and a brief discussion of the model differences. In essence, the independent assumption on latent variables in LIM leads to a significantly simpler to compute ELBO, requiring fewer approximations to be made. In contrast, the LFM retains dependence across the latent variables.\n\n*We have included more information as to how negative samples are generated --- in prior work [1,2,3,4] this is commonly done by corrupting a positive example. The additional information is in the experimental setup as well as in the section on link prediction (Section 5.1). \n\n\nReferences \n\n[1] Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P. and Riedel, S., 2017.

We respectfully disagree with the claim that our work does not show too much novel contribution. The probabilistic graphical model approach to knowledge graphs, as well as the training method using Bernoulli sampling to estimate the evidence lower bound, is novel. This novel ELBO approximation will be a crucial technique to scale VI for knowledge graph research as we found using only negative sampling (instead of using the ELBO or ELBO approximation), a typical trick to reduce the negative training examples, leads to a highly unstable training process. The technique trades off exact ELBO computation with an approximation, which is of orders of magnitude faster. Secondly, this ELBO approximation for LIM differs from typical stochastic variational inference techniques, as we are able to compute the full KL divergence term and are only required to approximate the full batches expected likelihood. Our work provides a framework which allows the specification of a family of generative knowledge graph models with any scoring functions that permits MLE of their parameters and any distribution that permits a reparameterization trick, allowing further research in VI to be easily incorporated into knowledge graph modeling. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for the corrections\u2014we corrected the KL divergence notation as well as the predicate index errors.\n", "title": "We respectfully disagree with the claim that our work does not show much novel contribution.

The paper proposed two models (Latent Fact Model and Latent Information Model) where the neural variational inference is carried out, with competitive results on standard datasets (WN18 and FB15K).\n\n* I am not fully convinced of the advantage of this variational inference approach compared with the optimization approach used in TransE, TransG, DistMult and ComplEx. As can be seen in Table 1, the best performance on WN18-RR and FB15K-257 are obtained without variational inference. In Table 2, performance of the variational inference approach is not as good as other approaches under the MR or Raw Hits metrics. Moreover, performance on FB15K is not reported in Table 2, which makes the result not as complete as Table 1.\n\n* It seems that the main difference between Latent Fact Model and Latent Information Model is the way prior is imposed on h.

Such models are based respectively on latent fact model and latent information model.\nThe authors argue that with the presented framework the underlying probabilistic semantics can be discovered. Experiments show performances comparable with state-of-art approaches.\n\nUnfortunately, the paper seems to me not clear and rather incomplete in its actual form.\nOverall, the proposal is novel. I cannot decide about significance because results do not outperform those of other approaches. To this extent, the authors should better discuss the results, explaining in more detail why this approach should be used instead of others (scales better, is faster, etc.).\n\nIn the abstract, it is asserted that one can discover underlying probabilistic semantics, but in the corpus of the paper this aspect is not described or mentioned in detail.\nSimilar problem for the reference to von-Mises distribution. This distribution is just named, it is said that the framework can handle such a distribution, but a reference to a paper and/or a short paragraph to explain the sentence are missing. This statement now results to be just information disconnected by the rest of the paper.\n\nIn a similar way, many other points suffer from a poor organization in my opinion.\nWhen describing LIM an error is introduced here that is then copied and pasted throughout the paper: in the productory on p, p is in R not in E. This is a simple typo, but the fact that it is repeated so many times, also in the proof, gives me the feeling that the paper was written at the last moment.\nFigures 1 and 2 are never referred.\n\nFormula 6 must be better explained. If I have not lost something, n is the number of labeled triples, s_c is undefined, b_c is the probability of s_c to be equal to 1, the index i is never used. The paper lacks information here.\n\nAs regards the experimental part, some results are shown in subsection 4.3 called link prediction, others in section 5 called link prediction analysis. This organization does not seem to me to be really optimal. I would suggest creating an experimental section.\nMoreover, the tests should be better explained, the tables are shown without specifying how they are built and how the values are collected. Information is provided in the appendix but could be included in the paper as the maximum limit is of 10 pages (8 suggested but I think an extra half page can be used).\nThe knowledge bases used should be at least cited, I know that freebase and wordnet are well-known but somewhere, in the description of the test, the name should be included. Also to specify the characteristics of the versions (WN18 vs WN18RR). Moreover, what does the value -257 in column 1, row 4 means?\nThen, it is said that Table 1 shows improvements for ComplEx, but such improvements are rather low, is there a way to prove their significance? Otherwise, I would say that the performance is the same for WN18.\nTables 1 and 2 contain cells with '-' value, what does it mean?\n\nDiscussion about table 3 is incomplete in my opinion. First of all, the \"proportion\" column should be described. Also, on one hand, it is true that the _member_meronym is the least accurate and prominent but the most problem may come from _hypernym, which is the most prominent and the accuracy is also low.
