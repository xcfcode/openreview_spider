We introduce the Neural Jump ODE (NJ-ODE) that provides a data-driven approach to learn, continuously in time, the conditional expectation of a stochastic process. Our approach models the conditional expectation between two observations with a neural ODE and jumps whenever a new observation is made. We define a novel training framework, which allows us to prove theoretical guarantees for the first time. In particular, we show that the output of our model converges to the $L^2$-optimal prediction. This can be interpreted as solution to a special filtering problem.

Theory__  \nWe completely agree with you that those methods that provably attain a global optimum are not the ones used in practice. We would like to emphasize that the convergence guarantees we provide are independent of the choice of the optimization method used to find the optimal weights. By citing those algorithms with provably convergence, we only wanted to mention that if you really wanted to have theoretical convergence from A to Z, you could get it.\n\nWe are fully aware that the study of global convergence of the stochastic gradient descent based methods with non convex objective functions and more specifically neural networks is an active research topic with multiple open questions. Therefore, it is natural not to try to solve this hard and independent problem here. However, even if a proper convergence study of this part is not available, it does not mean that the rest of the convergence study is not relevant for justifying the modeling part. Let us recall our main theorem.\n\n(1) We assume that for each number of sampling and for every size of the neural networks, their weights are chosen optimally, as to minimize the loss function. (2) Then, if the number of paths and the size of the neural networks tend to infinity, the output of our model converges in mean ($L^1$-convergence) to the conditional exception of the stochastic process $X$ given the current information.\n\nThis theorem proves that our algorithm with our specific loss function converges to the target process (the conditional expectation of the stochastic process). We want to emphasize that assuming to have the optimal weights (with respect to the loss function) does not immediately imply that the output of the model will give the desired result. For example, when we first started to construct our loss function, the convergence to conditional expectation was not guaranteed. We had to change the loss function in order to guarantee this convergence. For example, in GRU-ODE-Bayes, this type of convergence is not given, meaning that they cannot claim that the output of their model will always give the desired result. For instance, in an additional empirical example we provided (Heston model), their algorithm cannot manage to reach the desired result and produces worse outputs when the size of the network is increased. For this reason, we think the theory is particularly relevant for justifying the modeling part, even if we assume to have found the optimal weights. \n\nConcerning the theoretical argument, while we don\u2019t introduce new tools but rather make use of several existing mathematical tools (Probability theory, Stochastic Calculus and the universal theorem of approximation), we provide a new proof showing that the output of the model converges to the desired result. We are confident that this proof can inspire further research to derive similar theoretical guarantees. For instance, one could be inspired by this proof to show convergence of the ODE-RNN or GRU-ODE-Bayes, or to modify them in order to guarantee convergence. This proof might be adjusted for other similar problems. Therefore, we think that the given theoretical argument can be beneficial to related subfields.\n\nWe thank you for initiating this discussion about the need of theoretical guarantees. \n\n__Summary__  \nWe hope this addresses all of the reviewer's concerns.

We also thank you for your new valuable remarks and concerns which contributed to further improvements of the paper.\n\n__1. Algorithm__  \nYou are completely right that, from a theoretical point of view, the inner loop of the algorithm could be expressed by a single ODE, where continuously-in-time the outputNN is applied to the latent variable $h_t$ producing $y_t$ for all $t_i < t < t_{i+1}$. Actually, this is what we describe in equations (30) and (31) in the appendix. However, if we want to give an implementable pseudo-algorithm, this continuous-in-time procedure needs to be discretized. Since the outputs between observation times are important, we wanted to show how this discretization can be done. We think that it gives additional insight for the practical point of view, which was not provided by GRU-ODE-Bayes and ODE-RNN.\n\nYou are correct about the high-level framework, which is the same as in GRU-ODE-Bayes and ODE-RNN. To establish the connection to this, we added a description similar to the ODE-RNN description (new equation (7)), and clarified that the pseudo-algorithm is an implementable version of it. Thank you for pointing this out.\n\nYour description of the GRU-ODE-Bayes architecture and the difference to NJ-ODE is completely correct. As we described in the paper in the paragraph \u201cGRU-ODE-Bayes\u201d after equation (6), this architecture can be understood as a special case of the ODE-RNN architecture. In particular, a GRU is used for the RNN and a continuous version of the GRU for the neural ODE. Therefore, we think it is enough to explain the difference between our model architecture and the ODE-RNN architecture.  Thank you for pointing this out, we clarified that in the paragraph where the GRU-ODE-Bayes is presented. \n\n__2. Loss function__  \nYou are right that there exist similarities between the loss function of GRU-ODE-Bayes and NJ-ODE. This is not surprising, since both models try to control the jumps and also the behaviour between the jumps, which is done by the respective parts of the losses.\nTo respond to your question, apart from theoretical convergence reasons, there is no other motivation for our choice of loss function. Those choices were completely guided by the convergence proof. We did not try to change specific things as you suggested (combination of different loss functions) for the following reason. \n\nTo apply a negative log-likelihood loss function (pre-loss) and a loss function based on the KL-divergence (post-loss), an assumption on the conditional distribution is needed. In particular, GRU-ODE-Bayes makes the assumption that the conditional distribution is gaussian and models its time-dependent parameters. This assumption is restrictive, if the true underlying conditional distribution can not be described by a gaussian distribution (as for example in the case of the Heston dataset). We go another way, where we do not make any assumption on the underlying distribution. This implies that we cannot use a loss term where such an assumption would be needed.\n\n", "title": "Answers to new comments 1/2"}, "LANJaI_15K0": {"type": "review", "replyto": "JFKR3WqwyXR", "review": "The submission studies a simplified model of ODE-RNN and GRU-ODE-Bayes theoretically, proves convergence results, and presents experimental results in companion with the theoretical results. \n\n\nThe paper does a good job in defining concepts precisely. Though, this has come at a cost of highly complex notation, which may hinder the average researcher in the ML+diffeq community, who may not have a strong background in probability theory, to understand the paper. I would therefore recommend the authors to simplify the notation by deferring the precise mathematical definition of concepts such as information sigma algebras to the appendix. \n\n\nThe section (sec. 2.4) on optimal approximation of a stochastic process in the main text is somewhat vague. Optimality certainly depends on the cost function being considered, in which case, the appendix states that the 2-norm is used here. The particular norm being used is somewhat independent of the construction of the probability space, e.g. we could consider the same prob. space and evaluate the difference between the random variable and the fixed prediction using some other function, say the metric function induced by the L1-norm). This makes terms such as \u201cL^2(omega X omega tilde, ...)-minimizer\u201d somewhat confusing. Note my comment here is somewhat handwavy about the precise technicalities, but it should convey the relevant idea. \n\n\nMy main concern regarding the paper is about novelty. It seems that the model considered in section 3 falls broadly in line with ODE-RNN and GRU-ODE-Bayes. On the other hand, the experiments section also doesn\u2019t compare against latent ODE, which is a strong but relevant baseline. \n\n\nThe section (sec. 4) on theoretical convergence results mostly assume that the ERM can already be found. This rather strong assumption therefore leaves the theorems in that section not unexpected, and at the same time, less relevant for practitioners. It is also unclear whether convergence rates can be derived. \n\nThe paper does a decent job in clarifying its relationship with prior work. \n\n\nPost-rebuttal:\n- I thank the authors for improving the presentation of the paper and including additional experiments comparing to latent ODE.

In the ODE-RNN and in the GRU-ODE-Bayes, it is a recurrent neural network, where between two observations, the hidden state is modeled by a neural ODE. In our model, we don\u2019t use any recurrent neural network. This makes the model much easier and faster to train. We instead have a neural ODE that takes three more parameters (the last observation, the current time and the duration between the current time and the last observation). Moreover, we want to emphasize that we provided a novel training framework. For the first time, we provided a mathematical formulation, a rigorously defined problem statement and based on the new objective function, the theoretical guarantees that our algorithm works, which would not have been possible with a different training framework. In the GRU-ODE-Bayes paper, the authors do not give any theoretical guarantees for the model, only an empirical study.  In contrast, our method is proven to converge to the optimal solution.\n\n\n__Additional experimental validation__  \nThe main contribution of our project is the theoretical justification and the rigorously defined framework with the theoretical guarantees of convergence. This was not done by any paper prior to our work. For that reason, we think that having tested our model on those three synthetic datasets and on a real world dataset in addition to our theoretical guarantees was suffisant to prove that our algorithm works well in different scenarios.\nHowever, we have improved our experiment validation by adding the following experiments:\n- Heston model without the Feller condition. \n- Switching regime. In the first half of the path, the stochastic process is following a model M1 and in the second half of the path a model M2. \n- Model with explicit time dependence, i.e. where the drift of the SDE depends on t.\n- Convergence study also on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Heston dataset.\n- Experiments on Physionet in the same setting as the extrapolation experiment of the latent ODE (ODE-RNN), adding another comparison to a baseline model.\n\n__Different task than in previous literature__  \nActually, the task of predicting the conditional expectation is not new. It is different from the tasks considered in the latent ODE, but very similar to what the GRU-ODE-Bayes does. They also estimate the conditional expectation together with the standard deviation under normality assumption. More precisely, they try to predict the conditional distribution, under the assumption that it is given by a normal distribution. The predicted mean parameter of the normal distribution therefore is exactly the conditional expectation, which is the main interest in all real world forecasting applications. This is the reason why we mainly compared our method to GRU-ODE-Bayes.\n\n__Summary__  \nWe hope we have addressed every concern that the reviewer has raised. We would be very happy to have further discussion if there are any other obstacles to raising the review score.\n\n", "title": "Clarification of contribution over existing work and additional experiments"}, "ysRFjqMTCqT": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "LANJaI_15K0", "comment": "Thank you for your review.\n\n__Simplify the paper__  \nWe have simplified the main paper a lot, by moving the precise mathematical definition of concepts and the theorems to the appendix.

Therefore, we put more emphasis on clarifying that we consider the minimization problem with respect to the $L^2$-norm throughout the paper.\n\n__Novelty__  \nOur model is different from the previous work.

In contrast, our method is proven to converge to the optimal solution.\n\n__Added comparison with latent ODE__  \nIn our paper we consider exactly the same task as the GRU-ODE-Bayes paper. The latent ODE paper, although being very similar, does not consider the same task. In particular, the latent ODE (as it is) can not be used for online forecasting. This is reflected in the way it is applied to the extrapolation task, where the model is trained in a supervised learning setting, mapping the first half (input) of the time series to the second half (target). Compared to this, our (and GRU-ODE-Bayes) approach can be interpreted as unsupervised learning. In contrast to the latent ODE, the ODE-RNN might be used for the online forecasting task, but the authors emphasize (in their paper and their official implementation of the models) that ODE-RNN should be used for interpolation tasks only.\nThis is the reason why we did not compare our method to the latent ODE in the first place. \nAlthough our approach is different from latent ODE\u2019s approach, their extrapolation task is one that can be tackled by both models. We have added an experiment to the paper, where we apply our model in the exact same setting as the latent ODE for the extrapolation task on physionet. Our model achieves a performance of $1.945 \\pm 0.007$ ($\\times 10^{-3}$) and outperforms the latent ODE with a reported performance of $2.208 \\pm 0.050$ ($\\times 10^{-3}$).\n\n__Assumption that ERM can be found in convergence results__  \nWe deliberately constructed the loss function in such a way that convergence can be proven, therefore, it is not surprising that our results are expected. However, it is the first time that such a proof was provided for the class of neural ODE based models.\nWe have added a paragraph after the (informal) theorem outlining that the assumption that the ERM can already be found is not restrictive. There exist global optimization methods, as for example simulated annealing, that provably converge to a global optimum in probability. Apart from that, several works try to show that most local optima of neural networks are nearly globally optimal. This implies that in practice, using standard stochastic gradient descent methods which converge to local minima, will supply nearly optimal weights that should be good enough for the approximation.\nSince the proofs of our theorems depend on the universal approximation theorem, which does not provide convergence rates, we also cannot derive convergence rates from our analysis.\n\n__Summary__  \nWe hope we have addressed every concern that the reviewer has raised. We would be very happy to have further discussion if there are any other obstacles to raising the review score.\n", "title": "Simplified paper, clarification of contribution and comparison to latent ODE"}, "9G-gmwicrfq": {"type": "review", "replyto": "JFKR3WqwyXR", "review": "Summary: This paper introduces Neural Jump Ordinary Differential Equations as a method for learning models of continuous-time stochastic processes sampled at random time epochs. Specifically, the paper studies the problem of estimating the marginal conditional expectation (i.e., the L2 optimal approximation conditional on the available information) by estimating an auxiliary stochastic differential equation, parameterized by  neural networks, that approximates the conditional expectation of the process of interest at each point in time. The neural networks are trained by using a \u201crandomized\u201d mean squared-loss objective. The main theoretical results in the paper include asymptotic consistency of the optimal objective value in the limit of a large neural network, as well as consistency of a Monte Carlo sample average estimator of the value. The paper also establishes the L2 convergence of the estimated auxiliary solution to the marginal conditional expectation.\n\nThe technical details in the paper are mostly sound, and I believe it should be of interest to a wide community. The question of estimating stochastic models sampled at regular or irregular intervals is of broad utility. There are some technical issues however, but these can be resolved I believe. In particular, in the conclusions of Theorem 4.1 and 4.2, it seems as though the authors claim almost sure convergence, unless I am misunderstanding their statement.  What the authors establish is convergence in L2, but why does is imply almost sure convergence? Wouldn\u2019t one require uniform integrability to conclude more? Furthermore, this is not a process level convergence result, and therefore I do not believe that they can conclude (as in Remark G.3) that the limit holds almost surely. (Also, the authors seem to suggest tin Remark G.2 that they\u2019re not establishing L2 convergence, but this could be a problem with the writing). \n\nComing to the writing, I note that I did find the paper somewhat sloppy in its use of terminology and notation. For instance on p.1 the authors state \u201c...while stochastic processes are continuous in time...\u201d This is not quite true, since one can define discrete-time stochastic processes. I also found the discussion around  justifying \u201cirregular\u201d sampling of the stochastic process to be poorly written. In particular, it is stated that \u201c...dividing the time-line into equally-sized intervals...is again making assumptions and information is lost...\u201d well, any sampling will involve a loss of information, and the randomized sampling process described in this paper also involves assumptions. I don\u2019t think this comment is appropriate. Furthermore, the authors do not make a clear case for why their irregular sampling procedure is appropriate. I\u2019m quite certain that the sampling process introduces bias into the estimation; for instance, Theorem 1 of ref. [1] below provides sufficient conditions under which an \u201cirregularly\u201d sampled estimator of a functional of an SDE is unbiased. The authors must do a better job of justifying their method. I would also urge them to add an example of a randomized sampling process; for instance, a Poisson process sampler would satisfy their definition, in which case the sampling time epochs form an ordered statistic.\n\nComing to the development of the stochastic model, it is unclear to me as to why all of the random \u201cobjects\u201d cannot be defined on the same sample space. Essentially, couldn\u2019t one view the sampling process as a point process on the same sample space supporting the SDE? \n\nNext, in Prop. 2.1, the authors state that the optimal adapted process approximating process is \\hat{X}_t \u2014 but \\hat{X_t} is only defined pointwise (i.e., at each time \u2018t\u2019) and it is not defined as a stochastic process. Indeed, for that the authors must describe the finite dimensional distributions for all finite sets of time epochs to define the stochastic process. I believe it is inappropriate to call this a stochastic process. This doesn\u2019t affect the main results, since the authors only establish convergence in an L2 sense, where the full distribution is not necessary. \n\nSome further minor comments:\n1. Change the term \u201cobservation dates\u201d to \u201cobservation epochs\u201d.\n2. Change \u201camount of observations\u201d to \u201cnumber of observations\u201d (or samples).\n3. On P.3 in the definition of \\lambda_k, the set \\mathcal{B}([0,T]) is undefined.\n4. The notation defining the function \\tilde{\\mu} is very confusing, please change.\n5. P.4 \u201c...since the variation of u...\u201d should be \u201c...since the total variation of u...\u201d\n6. What do you mean by \u201cergodic\u201d approximation of the objective? Isn\u2019t it simply a sample average approximation? Which ergodic theorem is playing a role here?\n7.

We try to clarify the points. The conditional expectation is the $L^2$-minimizer for the considered forecasting task. However, we can show convergence of the output of our model to the conditional expectation only with respect to the $L^1$-norm (additional assumptions would be needed for convergence in $L^2$-norm). It is important to differentiate here between \nthe 2-norm that is used to make the d_X-dimensional random variables 1-dimensional inside the expectations and \nthe $L^1$-norm used to show $L^1$-convergence to 0 for this 1-dimensional random variable. \nSince the 2-norm is equivalent to any other norm on $\\mathbb{R}^{d_X}$, this choice does not influence the result in any way. \nAs correctly remarked by the reviewer, convergence in $L^1$ does not imply almost sure convergence. However, we did not claim almost sure convergence, but only that the limits are equal almost surely, which is a direct consequence of $L^1$-convergence.

The irregular observation dates are needed to describe data that is observed at irregular times. In particular, we do not take the point of view that we have a model of which we can sample as often as we want. Instead, we try to give a mathematical description for data that is irregularly observed at random time points. We changed the terminology in the paper the better explain our point of view. We tried to keep the definition of the irregular observation times very general, under the  assumption that the observation times are independent of the stochastic process. \nThe reviewer is right that point processes on the same probability space are a way to define observation dates that might be correlated with the stochastic process. We had the  impression that the given way of defining the observation dates make them easier to understand, even though the product probability space consequently has to be considered. As suggested, examples for randomized sampling processes were added to the paper, including the suggested Poisson point process.\nWe do not analyse the bias of our algorithm, but only show that it is consistent. It is clear that the sampling procedure can introduce a bias to an estimator. An extreme case would be, that the time interval is divided in half and observations are only made on the first half, for which any estimator could hardly learn anything about the second half. However, this is already incorporated in our convergence results through the dependence on the probability measures $\\lambda_k$. \n\n__Is__ $\\hat{X}_t$ __a stochastic process?__  \nYes, in contrast to a Gaussian process, in its basic definition, a stochastic process is just a collection of random variables indexed by some index set (Wikipedia). Often this set is the time interval, as for example in the definition in [1, page 3 after Theorem 1]. In particular, a stochastic process is defined pointwise at each $t$. Therefore, this definition applies to $\\hat{X}_t$, which is defined pointwise.  \n[1] P. Protter. Stochastic integration and differential equations. 2005.\n\n__About further minor comments__\n1. We do not understand why the term \u201cobservation epochs\u201d would be suited better.

We are not sure which notation would be better or less confusing for $\\tilde{\\mu}$. Would you have any suggestions?\n5. Correct, we changed it, thanks for pointing out.\n6. What we mean here is that we take an average base only on one realization of the path, by averaging over the different observations in time rather than by averaging over multiple realizations of the paths. Such a time-average only equals the sample average under ergodicity assumptions, which we assume to be satisfied here. We do not explicitly use an ergodic theorem, but suppose that the claim of such a theorem is satisfied in the stated way.\n7. The definition was added to the paper (now in appendix).\n\n__Summary__  \nWe hope this addresses all of the reviewer's concerns.

The paper bears a considerable theoretical treatment, derived from the stochastic filtering literature, which is present both in the main body of the paper and the appendix. Besides the model, the paper also aims to provide a theoretical justification of the convergence of their method. \n\nI find the contribution of the paper somewhat obscure, its aims to be incremental with respect to the previous literature, and the experimental validation heavily unconvincing. I support my recommendation through the following points: \n\n- Following the well known (by now) neural ODE and neural jump SDE, the contribution of the paper seems minor. The authors state that they focus on giving theoretical guarantees, however, these are specific and loosely validated experimentally\n- There is a fair amount of space dedicate to the theoretical presentation of the background, I agree with the importance of theory, but I failed to see how that theory supports the claims of the paper. \n-the experiments are limited: only 3 synthetic examples and only one real-world one.\n-the authors states that their method focuses on approximating (directly) the conditional expectation, this seems to be a different with the previous literature. However, if that's the case, the authors should consider more benchmarks such as linear filters (adapted to non-uniformly-spaced data), Gaussian processes, or general time series models. \n\nThis paper does have a contribution. My recommendation is that  the authors show it in a clearer (to the point) manner with an improved experimental validation.
