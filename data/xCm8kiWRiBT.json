Although there has been a great deal of work on attacking models for colored and grayscale images, little is known about attacks on models for binary images. Models trained to classify binary images are used in text recognition applications such as check processing, license plate recognition, invoice processing, and many others. In contrast to colored and grayscale images, the search space of attacks on binary images is extremely restricted and noise cannot be hidden with minor perturbations in each pixel. Thus, the optimization landscape of attacks on binary images introduces new fundamental challenges.\n\nIn this paper we introduce a new attack algorithm called Scar, designed to fool classifiers of binary images. We show that Scar significantly outperforms existing L0 attacks applied to the binary setting and use it to demonstrate the vulnerability of real-world text recognition systems. Scar\u2019s strong performance in practice contrasts with hardness results that show the existence of worst-case classifiers for binary images that are robust to large perturbations. In many cases, altering a single pixel is sufficient to trick Tesseract, a popular open-source text recognition system, to misclassify a word as a different word in the English dictionary. We also demonstrate the vulnerability of check recognition by fooling commercial check processing systems used by major US banks for mobile deposits. These systems are substantially harder to fool since they classify both the handwritten amounts in digits and letters, independently. Nevertheless, we generalize Scar to design attacks that fool state-of-the-art check processing systems using unnoticeable perturbations that lead to misclassification of deposit amounts. Consequently, this is a powerful method to perform financial fraud.", "keywords": ["Adversarial attacks", "Binary images", "Image Recognition", "Check processing systems"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper was referred to the ICLR 2021 Ethics Review Committee based on concerns about a potential violation of the ICLR 2021 Code of Ethics (https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics) raised by reviewers.

The L0, L2, and L_infty metrics are the three standard distance metrics and that, out of these three metrics, only the L0 distance is relevant in the binary setting.\n\n\u201cthe classifiers used in section 6.2 seems too simple\u201d: We evaluate our algorithm on a wide range of classifiers, including some simple classifiers (LogReg, MLP2, SVM) and some more complex classifiers (CNN, LeNet5). As shown in the appendix B.1, the CNN and LeNet5 classifiers achieve over 99% accuracy on MNIST, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art. Finally, we also note that more complex classifiers are not necessarily more robust to attacks. In fact, in Appendix B.2, we observe that the SVM classifier is more robust to attacks than CNN and LeNet5.\n\n\u201cit would make the case stronger if simple defense algorithms are also considered\u201d: Evaluating simple defense algorithms is an interesting direction for future work. As a first step to understanding the vulnerabilities of binary classifiers, we think it is most relevant to evaluate classifiers without defenses, which corresponds to the classifiers used in industry such as for check processing systems.\n\n\u201ctau is set to 0.1. How is tau selected and how does tau impact the performance?\u201d: A larger threshold tau would produce a better attack, but at the cost of a larger number of queries. A smaller tau would improve the number of queries to the classifier, but would produce a worse attack. We pick tau such that it achieves a good balance between the two extremes. We will make this clearer.\n\n\u201cPlease consider rewriting the last sentence of the abstract.\u201d: Thank you for the suggestion, we suggest changing it to \u201cConsequently, it is important to raise awareness of the vulnerabilities of check processing systems and other binary image recognition systems.\u201d", "title": "Addressing the list of Cons"}, "W_Zz0P__9Cc": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "5pfEZ1-sJj", "comment": "Thank you for your careful review and your positive comments --- we believe we address your main reservation that existing attacks can be employed in the binary setting.

See the relation to our paper below:\n\nConnection to \u201cSparseFool: a few pixels make a big difference\u201d: SparseFool relies on an L1 relaxation of the L0 problem. L1 relaxations are not applicable in the binary setting since there are only two possible values for each pixel.\n\nConnection to \u201cOne Pixel Attack for Fooling Deep Neural Networks\u201d: This paper focuses on attacks which modify a single pixel. In the binary setting, if it was possible to attack a classifier by modifying a single pixel, Vanilla SCAR would have found that pixel in the first iteration, since it attempts to flip every pixel. However, as we see in the experiments, in the overwhelming number of cases, Vanilla SCAR flips more than one pixel. Therefore, multiple pixel flips are necessary in order to fool binary classifiers in most cases and one pixel attacks do not apply.\n\nNumerical results are hard to read: Thank you for the suggestion, we will add a table in the next version of the manuscript.\n\n\u201cIf L_0 distance isn't the goal, why not?\u201d: We believe that the L0 distance is a simple and fair objective for comparing the performance of SCAR to other algorithms which aim to minimize L0 distance. However, as discussed, and similarly to any distance metric we are aware of for adversarial attacks, the L0 distance is not perfect and we discuss why. We don\u2019t believe that there exists a universal metric which perfectly measures the perceptibility of any noise added to any image.

This paper proposes an algorithm that efficiently searches for valid attacks (both targeted and untargeted) which cause minimum flipped pixels. The proposed method is evaluated on digit classification, letter classification, and check processing systems. The baselines compared are mostly methods that were originally developed for color images.\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nReasons for score:\n\nThis is a borderline paper which I tend to vote for rejection. The problem is well-defined and the method is clearly introduced. However, the evaluation of the proposed method is flawed. In particular, the classifiers being attacked seem to be simple and the perceptibility metric is questionable.\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nPros:\n\nThis paper proposes a novel problem with a non-trivial impact. The problem of binary image classification is also well-motivated. The authors provide a clear explanation of how attacks on the binary images are different from those on color images.\n \nThe authors provide theoretical analysis about the upper limit of pixels that need to be flipped in order to confuse the classifier.\n\nThe related work section is well-organized and the authors clearly state why previous works on color images do not apply to the binary image settings.\n\nBoth the problem formulation and description of the method are well-organized. \n\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons:\n\nIn the problem formulation, one constraint is that the attacks should be imperceptible to humans. This is measured by D_x(x'). However, D_x is parameterized as L0 distance which is not convincing. For instance, slightly increasing the font size of the same letter would incur a large L0 distance while making the modification imperceptible. On the other hand, transforming the letter \"I\" to \"T\" might incur a very small L0 distance while causing perceptible change. The authors should justify the use of L0 or consider experimenting with other parameterizations of D_x.\n\nWhile the classifier used in section 6.3 is carefully selected and well justified, the classifiers used in section 6.2 seems too simple. In addition, instead of attacking plain classifiers, it would make the case stronger if simple defense algorithms are also considered.\n\nThe results in Section 6.5 do not have baseline algorithms to compare with. Also, it would be helpful if a reference to the check processing system is provided.\n\nThis paper lacks a conclusion.\n\n\n##########################################################################\n\nSuggestions & Questions:\n\nIn section 6.1, tau is set to 0.1.
