A significant number of neural architectures for this task (neural readers) have recently been developed and evaluated on large cloze-style datasets. We present experiments supporting the emergence of \u201cpredication structure\u201d in the hidden state vectors of a class of neural readers including the Attentive Reader and Stanford Reader. We posits that the hidden state vectors can be viewed as (a representation of) a concatenation [P, c] of a \u201cpredicate vector\u201d P and a \u201cconstant symbol vector\u201d c and that the hidden state represents the atomic formula P(c). This predication structure plays a conceptual role in relating \u201caggregation readers\u201d such as the Attentive Reader and the Stanford Reader to \u201cexplicit reference readers\u201d such as the Attention-Sum Reader, the Gated-Attention Reader and the Attention-over-Attention Reader. In an independent contribution, we show that the addition of linguistics features to the input to existing neural readers significantly boosts performance yielding the best results to date on the Who-did-What dataset.", "keywords": ["Natural language processing", "Deep learning", "Applications"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The reviewers mostly agree that this paper offers valuable insights about a family of problems in automatic \"reading\" of text, as well as current solutions.

Below are our answers for the question.  \n\nReviewer: However, I found the organization and the overall message of this paper quite confusing. First of all, it feels that the authors want to explain the above behavior with some definition of the \u201cstructures\u201d. However, I am not sure that how successful the attempt is. For me, it is still not clear what the structures are. This makes reading section 4 a bit frustrating. \n\nResponse: Our claim is that in the aggregation reader the hidden state vector can be decomposed into two parts --- a semantics-free entity pointer and a property being stated of that pointer.  See our earlier comments on predication structure.\n\nReviewer: I am also not sure what is the take home message of this paper. Does it mean that the entity marking should be used in the MR models? Should we design models that can also model the entity reference at the same time? What are the roles of the linguistic features here? Should we use linguistic structure to overcome the reference issue?\n\n\nResponse: \nQ: Does it mean that the entity marking should be used in the MR models?\nQ: Should we design models that can also model the entity reference at the same time?\n\nEntity pointers contain reference information.  In the case of multiple choice reading comprehension questions the pointers indicate which answer choice is being referred to.  All high performing reading comprehension systems rely on reference annotation of some sort.  Anonymization provides reference annotation because it replaces entities in both the answer choices and the passage with entity identifiers making the coreference apparent.  But if we eventually want to move to doing the coreference within the deep model then entity pointers seem essential. It seems important to note that aggregation readers are already constructing entity pointers.\n\nQ: What are the roles of the linguistic features here? Should we use linguistic structure to overcome the reference issue?\n\nOur linguistic features provide some simple information that seems orthogonal to the issue of entity pointers and predication structure. The fact that we observe consistent improvement by adding these features suggests that the readers are not being learned to capture this information otherwise. We find improvements from features with both an aggregation reader and an explicit reference reader (see Table 3). Like the above point about modeling coreference better in the deep models themselves, these findings suggest that another future research direction is to seek to capture simple beneficial linguistics features in the readers themselves. We will make this more clear in the paper.

A main finding of the paper seems to be the section after equation 11 where it is shown that the aggregation readers effectively learn to mimic the explicit reference readers. This is an emergent structure, but what sort of logic does it encode? Is the term \"logic\" in reference to the symbolic nature of the learned anonymized entity embeddings? \n\n\nReply: We are arguing for the emergence of \u201cpredication\u201d.  We will change the title to \u201cEmergent Predication Structure \u2026\u201d.  By predication we mean that the hidden state h_t of the passage at position (or word) t can be viewed as a pair (Phi_t, c_t) where Phi_t is a property (or statement or predicate) being stated of a particular constant symbol c_t at position t in the passage.  A logician might write this as h_t = Phi_t[c_t].  We present evidence that the hidden state vector h_t can be \u201cparsed\u201d into its parts Phi_t and c_t and that these parts can be interpreted as a predicate and a constant symbol.\n\n\nA question has the form Psi[x] --- a question asks for a candidate answer c such that the passage implies Psi[c].  At a simplified level we are looking for a place t in the passage such that the statement Phi_t[x] being expressed at position t implies Psi[x] (for any x).  In this case the answer is the constant symbol c_t being \u201ctalked about\u201d at position t.\n\n\nTo allow for a combination of evidence from different statements in the passage the answer selection might be\n\n\n       (1) argmax_c   sum_t    <e(Phi_t),e(Psi)>  <e(c_t),e(c)>.\n\n\nThe first inner product is interpreted as measuring the extent to which Phi_t[x] implies Psi[x] for any x.  The second inner product should be near zero if c_t is different from c and near a large constant if c_t = c.\n\n\nSelection rule (1) is not built into aggregation readers. In an aggregation reader the training objective has the form\n\n\n      (2)  argmax_c  sum_t   <h_t,q>  <h_t,e(c)>.\n\n\nHere q is the vector representation of the question.  Equations (1) and (2) agree if q is interpreted as e(Psi) and h_t is a direct sum of e(Phi_t) and e(c_t).  We claim that this structure of q and h_t emerges from training on (2).  This claim is supported in table 1 and figure 1.\n\n\nSelection rules (1) and (2) also address a question of reviewer 3 --- the support for an answer can indeed combine several statements in the passage.\n\n\nWe will revise the paper shortly to make the intended structure clearer.\n\nQuestion: (11) and (12) imply a H = S (+) E direct sum structure for the representations? This is because the entity identifiers, being semantics-free, must be permutable (approximately) without changing the model scores, correct? Do the authors have a sense of how big the E subspace must be to handle a given number of entity vectors? Is it equal to the maximum number of entities in a document?\n\n\nReply: Yes, our intuition started from the the fact that the entity identifiers can be permuted and therefore must be semantics free.  Even for non-anonymized data such as Who-Did-What, annotating the passage with which places in the passage refer to which answers improves performance.  We believe that even in this case an \u201canswer pointer\u201d is coded in the hidden state and equations (11) and (12) appear to hold.  This is supported by the performance of the one-hot pointer reader in table 2.\n\n\nIn the case of CNN there are about 500 entities but the entity embedding is only 100 dimensional.  We did some experiments with \u201ctwo-sparse\u201d entity id embeddings which were designed and not trained.  These did reasonably well.  These codings give 2d(d-1) distinct embeddings in dimension d (there are d choose 2 sparsity patterns and 4 choices of the sign of the non-zero values). We looked at the literature on packing vectors on the surface of a sphere where we found the suggestion of two-sparse vectors.  This generalizes to k-sparse vectors but we have no experiments for k > 2. We will add some discussion of this in the next revision.\n\nQuestion: Regarding equation 11, it is unclear why the inner-product of h_{t} and the answer embedding would be a fixed positive constant 'c' - especially since h_{t} is the embedding obtained by running a bi-LSTM/GRU encoder on the paragraph. i.e. for all t in R(a,p), the h_t's will encode everything it has seen before. However it is intuitive that since all t's in R(a,p) refers to positions of answers in the document, the inner product would be high (but not necessarily fixed).\n\n\n\n\nReply: We select the entity identifier with the largest inner product with the weighted hidden state vector.   If one of the entity identifier embeddings had larger norm than the others then the selection process would be biased toward that entity identifier.  But the system should be invariant to permuting the identifiers.  The caption of figure 1 gives the mean and variance of the square norm of the entity embeddings and indeed the variance (17) is small compared to the mean (169).  We will say something about this in the revised version.\n\nQuestion: Also in equation 11, it is also very counter-intuitive that for all t not in R(a,p) the inner product of h_{t} and the answer embedding would be zero. For example, consider the embedding of h_{t+1}. Since this word is just after the answer word, will it have a very low inner product? It would be nice to add this number after row 2 in table 1.\n\n\nReply: We will add this to table 1.\n\n\nIt should be noted that a precise word position for each candidate answer is given to the system. In the case of CNN it is the position of the anonymized entity identifier.  In other cases it is given by explicit reference annotation.  The attention heatmaps show that the attention is highly focused on the precise word of the given candidate answer positions.  So the equivalence of aggregation readers and explicit reference readers does not require that (11) holds at non-answer positions adjacent to answer positions.  But if the attention is highly focused on the precise answer positions there is no reason to remember answer embeddings --- the LSTM (or GRU) could immediately forget them to leave room in the hidden state for more useful information. But we will do the measurement.\n\nQuestion: It is hard to follow equation 12. A new variable h' has been introduced just before which has not been used in the equation which makes it even more confusing. I think the paper would benefit a lot if section 4 is re-visited and written more clearly because I think it is the most important section of the paper (especially explanation/intuition behind equation 12 and 13).\n\n\nReply: The introduction of h\u2019 in the discussion is simply to formalize the invariance to permutation of the entity identifiers.  We may drop this and just say \u201cbecause the system should be invariant to entity identifier permutation \u2026\u201d.  We will definitely rework section 4.\n\nQuestion: Equation 13 suggests the existence of a sum-structure between two orthogonal subspaces S (subspace of statement vectors) and E(subspace of entity pointers). Do the experiment in section 5 explicitly capture this? It is clear to me that the one-hot and general pointer encoding are ways to inject coreference information in the model but does it explain the additive nature of the embeddings (since the two vectors are concatenated).\n\n\nReply:  In general concatenation guarantees sum-structure --- [x,y] can be uniquely decomposed as [x,0] + [0,y] where the addends are orthogonal.  It would be simpler to work just with concatenation.  However, the learning system need not make the orthogonal subspaces S and E axis-aligned.\n", "title": "replies to reviewer 1"}, "B17mJ1Sml": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkNuJqRzx", "comment": "All reviewers asked for clarification of section 4.
