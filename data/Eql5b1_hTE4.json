Why does the proportion of non-critical parameters is assumed to be the same as the noise rate?\n- Thank you for your nice concern! We have the intuition that if the label noise rate is high, we will have a large set of incorrect labels and a small set of correct labels. Then, there could be a large number of non-critical parameters which overfit the incorrect labels; while a small number of critical parameters which fit the correct labels. We conjecture that the number of non-critical parameters is proportional to the label noise rate and therefore use the label noise rate to help identify the non-critical parameters. We agree with the reviewer that the non-critical parameters may not rely strictly on the label noise rate, which needs further investigations. For the proposed method, which firstly studies the critical and non-critical parameters, it empirically works well as supported by comprehensive experimental results. We will add similar discussions in the paper to reflect the reviewer\u2019s insight. \n\n2. What will the performance be like if the proportion of non-critical parameters is assumed to be a constant number or estimation of the noise rate is too bad?\n- Thanks for the suggestion! First of all, as shown in the answer to the above question, it is intuitive to relate the proportion of non-critical parameters to the label noise rate, which is task-dependent and can provide a reliable solution. However, it is interesting to see how it works if we set the proportion of non-critical parameters as a constant number. We would like to mention that it may be hard to set or tune the constant number for the proportion because we only exploit noisy data in this paper. In the paper, we use the noisy validation set for early stopping. Note that the correct labels are dominating in each noisy class and that label noise is random, the accuracy on the noisy validation set and the accuracy on the clean test data set are positively correlated. The noisy validation set therefore can be employed. We will try to use the noisy validation set to locate constants for the proportion of the non-critical parameters on MNIST, F-MNIST, and CIFAR10 in the updated version. Specifically, we will compare the constants and will discuss the relationship between the constants and the label noise rate.\n\n- If the estimation is largely different from the real noise rate, a too large estimation error may hurt the performance of the proposed method. However in fact, the noise rate can be effectively estimated [1-2]. In this paper, we use the estimated noise rate to achieve the superior performance. When the estimation error is within an acceptable range, our method is robust as shown in the ablation study. Your comments about setting the proportion of non-critical parameters are really constructive. We agree that it is an important point needed in-depth study. \n\n3. Why does the proposed method use a noisy validation set for early stopping?\n- Our work follows the often used practices in the literature of learning from noisy labels, using a noisy validation set for early stopping. The intuition to do so is discussed in the answer to the above question. It empirically works well as also supported by the existing methods, e.g., GCE [3], Forward [4], and T-Revision [5].

Recall our proposed method and the optimality criterion, the non-critical parameters are penalized to be zero (or close to zero), which makes them to have much less effect on generalization. For the negative update rule in this paper, when we exploit the $\\ell_1$ regularizer, it is effective to achieve that non-critical parameters are pushed to be very sparse and be very close to zero.

As the deep models fit training data with clean labels in the early stage of training, the authors propose a novel method to identify those more important parameters for fitting clean labels. They then deactivate the unimportant parameters to reduce side effects brought by noisy labels, which enhances the fitting to clean labels implicitly. I think this paper is interesting and makes sense. The major comments and issues are as follows: \n\n------Major comments------\n1. Different from other complex methods for learning with noisy labels , this work discusses that standard cross entropy loss can achieve competitive performance with early stopping. We can therefore focus the training stage before early stopping to handle noisy labels. The authors skillfully allow the optimality to be checked by a scalar, and then judge the importance of the parameters by analyzing the influence of the parameters on this scalar. The idea of this paper is novelty and meaningful. \n\n2. The paper is very well-written. The description of its motivation and technical details is clear and flows smoothly, which makes it easy for readers to understand the core idea of this paper and follow its implementation details.\n\n3. The experimental results are convincing. The authors provide a very detailed description of experimental settings. Besides, this paper exploits multiple methods for comparison and considers various noise settings to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets are convincing. The authors also perform an ablation study to present the proposed method is insensitive to the estimation of noise rate. \n\n------Issues------\n1. I only find the illustration of comparison between CE and CDR in the case of noisy CIFAR-100. This paper aims to reduce the side effect of noisy labels before early stopping, thus CE is an importance baseline in this paper. Can the authors add illustrations of the experimental results in other cases like Figure.2? \n\n2. The baselines and experimental results are sufficient. Could the authors add some introduction for the baselines and more detailed discussion for experimental results. \n\n3. The authors may need add some explanation for Eq.(2) and Eq.(5). The proposed method makes use of the memorization effects of deep models. The authors directly write \\tilde{S} rather than S in Eq.(5). However, this may be easy to misunderstand. I suggest that the authors can emphasize it or change it. \n\n4. Some typos need to be corrected. (1) \u201cThe underlying issue of directly using the gradient of......\u201d; (2) \u201cRobust positive update uses the gradients to update the critical ones......\u201d.\n\n5. Some minor comments. (1) The experimental results in Table 1 are too dense. (2) The figures are not readable, especially the title is small for me. This makes it a little hard to match the figures with specific cases. (3) The parameter (noise rate) $\\tau$ still needs to be estimated, which may be challenging. It will be promising to automatically set this parameter during training. Thus, a more in-depth analysis is worthy of further learning. \n\nI hope the authors can address these issues carefully to improve this work.

This paper has clearly explained the two types of parameters, i.e., critical parameters and non-critical parameters.\n2.\tThis paper proposes a novel method with an interesting idea. Unlike many existing methods that are aggregations of multiple techniques, this paper only focuses on one concept. It is simple but effective.

For example, $\\mathbf{w}$ denotes all the learnable parameters of the model in the paper, while $\\mathbf{w}$ usually means a vector. So I would suggest the authors to use another symbol to denote the set of all the learnable parameters of the model, e.g., $\\mathcal{W}$.\n2.\tIt is not well justified why this paper chooses the $\\ell_1$ regularizer. Is there any consideration to use the $\\ell_1$ regularizer except that could be associated with weight decay?\n3.\tThe hyper-parameter $\\tau$ (noise rate) needs to be known.

The proposed method is interesting in its design. The authors provide an alternative interpretation for the optimality criterion, which reveals that the value of the parameter can also be used to check the optimality. It is novel and of significance. Meanwhile, the proposed method is easy to implement. This method can also be applied to existing algorithms to further improve their robustness.\n2. Overall, this paper is very well written and well organized. The technical details are easy to follow, and Algorithm 1 helps understand the procedures. \n3. Extensive experiments are performed to verify that the proposed method indeed helps over the baselines at fighting noisy labels. I like the details of experimental settings, which really can help reproduce these experimental results.\n\nCons.\n1. The new interpretation for the optimality criterion is important, but lacks detailed explanation. I find that there is only simple analysis. Perhaps the authors could add some details or citations for better understanding.\n2. Though the baseline S2E uses AutoML, it seems that S2E is an improvement on co-teaching or co-teaching+? It is not suitable to place it at the end. \n3. For some baselines such GCE and Joint, there are hyperparameters to consider. The authors should explain how to set their values for a fair comparison. For APL, there are multiple combinations of loss functions. In this experiment, which one did you choose? I suggest that the authors add such explanation in Section 4.2, which will make the results more convincing. \n4. The proposed method implicitly exploits the memorization effects of deep models, and can reduce the side effect of noisy labels before early stopping. After early stopping, noisy labels still affect the performance. How to reduce the side effect during the whole training by using this idea? I personally think this is an interesting and meaningful direction. The authors can regard this as future work to improve this paper. \n\nOverall, I think this paper makes sense in learning with noisy labels. The proposed method is novel and effective.
