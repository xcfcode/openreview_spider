Furthermore, in the era of big data, designing divergence measure that is interpretable and can handle high-dimensional and complex data becomes extremely important. In this paper, we propose a post selection inference (PSI) framework for divergence measure, which can select a set of statistically significant features that discriminate two distributions. Specifically, we employ an additive variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for features and introduce a general hypothesis test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which has an asymptotically normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically. Through synthetic and real-world feature selection experiments, we show that the proposed framework can successfully detect statistically significant features. Last, we propose a sample selection framework for analyzing different members in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) family.

The top-k selection problem is phrased as a linear constraint reducing it to the problem of Lee et al.  The approach is illustrated on toy examples and a GAN application.\n\nThe main criticism of the problem is the novelty of the paper.  R1 feels that it is largely just the combination of two known approaches (although it appears that the incomplete estimator is key), while R3 was significantly more impressed.  Both are senior experts in the topic.\n\nOn the balance, the reviewers were more positive than negative.  R2 felt that the authors comments helped to address their concerns, while R3 gave detailed arguments in favor of the submission and championed the paper.  The paper provides an additional interesting framework for evaluation of estimators, and considers their application in a broader context of post-selection inference."}, "review": {"H1lpAZgWAQ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "S1xJY1jeC7", "comment": "We really appreciate your feedback.

However, the combination is straightforward: the asymptotic Gaussian property of the incomplete mmd is the key.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that, as far as we know this is the first selective inference method for distribution comparison (or two-sample test). To achieve this, combining MMD and PSI is one of the simple approaches. To deal with the normality constraint in PSI, we also proposed an incomplete U-statistics estimator for MMD and showed basic theoretical properties of the estimator. Although the combination itself is intuitive, since MMD is heavily used in machine learning community in two-sample testing and generative modeling, we believe that this new estimator and application to PSI can shed new light to further improvements of MMD-based algorithms.\n\n>Furthermore, I think the applications (feature selection and test for GAN objective) is not exciting from the machine learning point of view. A better application which can show-case the obtained p-value is very useful will make the paper more interesting.\n\nFeature selection (or variable selection) is one of important machine learning problems including sparse learning. For instance, Lasso is a widely known feature selection method and there exist a large number of related papers in top machine learning venues. Even among the ICLR submissions this year, we found an another interesting feature selection paper:\nKnockoffGAN: Generating Knockoffs for Feature Selection using Generative Adversarial Networks\nhttps://openreview.net/forum?id=ByeZ5jC5YQ \n\nMoreover, feature selection has a number of important applications in biology and healthcare. In these filed, estimating p-value is extremely important. As for comparing generative models, analyzing GAN is one of hot topics in machine learning in particular for deep learning communities; although the result that we get (all null hypotheses rejected) is not the most surprising, we believe that the problem itself is important and further study needed.", "title": "Contribution and applicaitons"}, "Syl46BhIpX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkxV1bD02Q", "comment": "Thank you for your valuable comments.\n\n>However, I wish the paper could have explained the main idea clearly. Right now it is hard to me to judge whether or not the proposed estimator is correct (the only place that seems to support this is Fig. 4(a). Where the p-value seems to be clear to a uniform distribution. \n\nThe main idea is to use an estimator of MMD with normal response to perform testing and selective inference. The proposed incomplete estimator randomly subsamples the U-stats kernels of MMD, and asymptotic normality follows from properties of incomplete U-statistics. In finite sample cases, the correctness of this estimator is supported by the uniform p-value distribution in Figure 4(a), and also the fact that the false positive rate is successfully controlled at the desired \\alpha in both synthetic and real datasets.\n\n>For instance, the proposed PSI estimator, we will need to estimate the covariance matrix. This was explained in Section 3.3, and it was said that the algorithm in Fan et al. (2013) was used for the explanation. However, I think more detailed discussions and explanation should be provided here. In order to obtain correct p-value estimate, I believe getting accurate covariance matrix estimate is crucial. How large the sample size is needed, in order for us to get an accurate enough covariance matrix, to perform sub-sequent post selection inference?\n\nFor hypothesis testing, the consistency of the covariance matrix estimator is necessary to get accurate covariance matrix estimates. In our PSI setup, the consistency of the covariance matrix estimator which corresponds to the result of Theorem 2 and its corollaries is derived under standard regularity conditions. \n\nIn practice, for the small number of samples, the estimation of covariance matrix is extremely hard. As shown in the Figure 6 of supplementary material, we experimentally found that the estimation error of the incomplete MMD covariance is smaller than that of the block MMD covariance. Moreover, for the incomplete U-statistics MMD, we have $\\ell=rn$ samples to estimate the covariance matrix, while we have only $n/B$ samples for the block MMD. That is, the number of samples that can be used for covariance estimation of the incomplete U-statistics estimator is $rB$ times larger than that of the block estimator. In the setup of Figure 6, we have $rB = 100$. For example, for $n = 1000$, we can use $5000$ samples for the incomplete U-statistics, while we have only $50$ samples for the block estimator. Thus, for the block MMD, this is problematic for high-dimensional case (e.g., d = 100), and the estimated covariance matrix is not full-rank. To alleviate this issue, we employ the POET algorithm for the block estimator.  \n\nMoreover, we run the PSI algorithms for the white wine dataset by changing the number of samples as 200, 400, \u2026, 4000. As can be seen, both PSI algorithms can control the FPR with 2000 samples. Moreover, it is clear that the incomplete U-statistics estimator can get better performance than the block estimator in both TPR and FPR.
