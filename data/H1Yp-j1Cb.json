Although GANs can accurately model complex distributions, they are known to be difficult to train due to instabilities caused by a difficult minimax optimization problem. In this paper, we view the problem of training GANs as finding a mixed strategy in a zero-sum game. Building on ideas from online learning we propose a novel training method named Chekhov GAN. On the theory side, we show that our method provably converges to an equilibrium for semi-shallow GAN architectures, i.e. architectures where the discriminator is a one-layer network and the generator is arbitrary. On the practical side, we develop an efficient heuristic guided by our theoretical results, which we apply to commonly used deep GAN architectures.\nOn several real-world tasks our approach exhibits improved stability and performance compared to standard GAN training.", "keywords": ["Generative Adversarial Networks", "GANs", "online learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "This paper presents a GAN training algorithm motivated by online learning. The method is shown to converge to a mixed Nash equilibrium in the case of a shallow discriminator. In the initial version of the paper, reviewers had concerns about weak baselines in the experiments, but the updated version includes comparisons against a variety of modern GAN architectures which have been claimed to fix mode dropping. This seems to address the main criticism of the reviewers. Overall, this paper seems like a worthwhile addition to the GAN literature."}, "review": {"HJ66g8RgM": {"type": "review", "replyto": "H1Yp-j1Cb", "review": "It is well known that the original GAN (Goodfellow et al.) suffers from instability and mode collapsing. Indeed, existing work has pointed out that the standard GAN training process may not converge if we insist on obtaining pure strategies (for the minmax game). The present paper proposes to obtain mixed strategy through an online learning approach. Online learning (no regret) algorithms have been used in finding an equilibrium for zero sum game. However, most theoretical convergence results are known for convex-concave loss. One interesting theoretical contribution of the paper is to show that convergence result can be proved if one player is a shallow network (and concave in M).In particular, the concave player plays the FTRL algorithm with standard L2 regularization term. The regret of concave player can be bounded using existing result for FTRL. The regret for the other player is more interesting: it uses the fact the adversary's strategy doesn't change too drastically. Then a lemma by Kalai and Vempala can be used. The theory part of the paper is reasonable and quite well written. \n\nBased on the theory developed, the paper presents a practical algorithm. Compared to the standard GAN training, the new algorithm returns mixed strategy and examine several previous models (instead of the latest) in each iteration. The paper claims that this may help to prevent model collapsing.\n\nHowever, the experimental part is less satisfying. From figure 2, I don't see much advantage of Checkhov GAN. In other experiments, I don't see much improvement neither (CIFAR10 and CELEBA).The paper didn't really compare other popular GAN models, especially WGAN and its improved version, which is already quite popular by now and should be compared with.\n\nOverall, I think it is a borderline paper.\n\n-------------------------\nI read the response and the new experimental results regarding WGAN.\nThe experimental results make more sense now.\nIt would be interesting to see whether the idea can be applied to more recent GAN models and still perform better.\nI raised my score to 7.\n\n", "title": "borderline paper", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "HkQupw5gf": {"type": "review", "replyto": "H1Yp-j1Cb", "review": "This is an interesting paper, exploring GAN dynamics using ideas from online learning, in particular the pioneering \"sparring\" follow-the-regularized leader analysis of Freund and Schapire (using what is listed here as Lemma 4). By restricting the discriminator to be a single layer, the maximum player plays over a concave (parameter) space which stabilizes the full sequence of losses so that Lemma 3 can be proved, allowing proof of the dynamics' convergence to a Nash equilibrium. The analysis suggests a practical (heuristic) algorithm incorporating two features which emerge from the theory: L2 regularization and keeping a history of past models. A very simple queue for the latter is shown to do quite competitively in practice.\n\nThis paper merits acceptance on theoretical merits alone, because the FTRL analysis for convex-concave games is a very robust tool from theory (see also the more recent sequel [Syrgkanis et al. 2016 \"Fast convergence of regularized learning in games\"]) that is natural to employ to gain insight on the much more brittle GAN case. The practical aspects are also interesting, because the incorporation of added randomness into the mixed generation strategy is an area where theoretical justifications do motivate practical performance gains; these ideas could clearly be developed in future work.", "title": "Powerful theory tools applied naturally to GAN dynamics", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "Bko7pxAWz": {"type": "review", "replyto": "H1Yp-j1Cb", "review": "The paper applies tools from online learning to GANs. In the case of a shallow discriminator, the authors proved some results on the convergence of their proposed algorithm (an adaptation of FTRL) in GAN games, by leveraging the fact that when D update is small, the problem setup meets the ideal conditions for no-regret algorithms. The paper then takes the intuition from the semi-shallow case and propose a heuristic training procedure for deep GAN game. \n\nOverall the paper is very well written. The theory is significant to the GAN literature, probably less so to the online learning community. In practice, with deep D, trained by single gradient update steps for G and D, instead of the \"argmin\" in Algo 1., the assumptions of the theory break. This is OK as long as sufficient experiment results verify that the intuitions suggested by the theory still qualitatively hold true. However, this is where I have issues with the work:\n\n1) In all quantitative results, Chekhov GAN do not significantly beat unrolled GAN. Unrolled GAN looks at historical D's through unrolled optimization, but not the history of G. So this lack of significant difference in results raise the question of whether any improvement of Chekhov GAN is coming from the online learning perspective for D and G, or simply due to the fact that it considers historical D models (which could be motivated by sth other than the online learning theory).\n\n2) The mixture GAN approach suggested in Arora et al. (2017) is very related to this work, as acknowledged in Sec. 2.1, but no in-depth analysis is carried out. I suggest the authors to either discuss why Chekhov GAN is obviously superior and hence no experiments are needed, or compare them experimentally. \n\n3) In the current state, it is hard to place the quantitative results in context with other common methods in the recent literature such as WGAN with gradient penalty. I suggest the authors to either report some results in terms of inception scores on cifar10 with similar architectures used in other methods for comparison. Alternatively please show WGAN-GP and/or other method results in at least one or two experiments using the evaluation methods in the paper. \n\nIn summary, almost all the experiments in the paper are trying to establish improvement over basic GAN, which would be OK if the gap between theory and practice is small. But in this case, it is not. So it is not entirely convincing that the practical Algo 2 works better for the reason suggested by the theory, nor it drastically improves practical results that it could become the standard technique in the literature.

In the following we answer your concerns and requests. \n\nYour review indicates that you believe the experimental part does not demonstrate the benefits of our approach. We respectfully disagree and we kindly ask you to look again at the experiments. Moreover, 1) as you requested, we have added new results further highlighting the benefits of our approach compared to the baselines, and 2) we improved the visibility of Figure 2 which we believe might have confused the reviewer in the original submission since some colors might not have been easily readable.\n\nTo be specific:\n-In Figure 2 (toy example), you can see that after 50K steps our method captures all of the modes while the standard GAN is missing one mode.\n-In Table 1 (MNIST),  you can see that our method (10 states) generates 26% more classes compared to standard GAN training, and stabilizes the training which can be observed through the reduced variance. Please note that our approach also does better with respect to the reverse KL measure. \n-In Table 2 (CIFAR 10), you can see that our methods consistently outperform the standard GAN training with respect to the MSE measure. Concretely, the MSE of our method (25 states) is lower by 20% than the MSE of the standard training method. In terms of number of images from the test/training set with the lowest reconstruction, GAN achieves 0%, whereas our best variant achieves 82.43% and 80.33%, respectively.\n-In Table 4 (CelebA), you can see that our method outperforms the standard GAN training with respect to the number of modes that are classified by the auxiliary discriminator as not real.\nConcretely, our method improves by a factor of 50%.\nThis means that using an auxiliary discriminator based on our method, only 1400 images of the true test set were recognized by the auxiliary discriminator as fake.\nConversely, using an auxiliary discriminator on the standard method, there were 3000 images recognized by the auxiliary discriminator as fake.\n- In addition, we have now added a new section with experiments showcasing Inception Score and Frechet Dirichlet Distance (FID) for our method and show improvement over several strong baselines (Section 5.3). \n\n\u201cFrom figure 2, I don't see much advantage of Checkhov GAN\u201d\nSee our answer above, light colors indicate a mode with less mass. We therefore clearly observe that the normal GAN suffers from mode collapse, while our approach finds all the modes. We hope that by going again over the experimental part, you will find that our method does improve over the standard GAN training.\n\nRegarding comparison to other methods: WGAN is a different loss function rather than a different GAN training method. Our method can be applied to other GAN loss functions, including WGAN. Thus, WGAN is not a competitor to our approach, but rather another setup where our approach could be applied. We do agree that a comparison to WGAN is valuable and we have now added the requested results to the paper (please see Table 5, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 11).\n*Applying our method on top of WGAN (denoted Chekhov WGAN in the paper), outperforms WGAN across all epochs consistently in terms of both metrics (inception score and FID). \n", "title": "Please consider updated experimental results clearly showing the benefits of our approach"}, "Bylluw97M": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Bko7pxAWz", "comment": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback and the positive review regarding the theoretical part of the paper. We have added a significant number of experimental results to address your concerns and suggestions about the experimental part of the paper. We detail the changes made to the paper below.\n\n1) Unrolled GAN: We first would like to point out that, unlike what you mentioned in your review, unrolled GAN does not look at historical D\u2019s but rather it looks at **future** discriminator\u2019s updates by unrolling a few optimization steps, thus making the two algorithms very different. The unrolling procedure comes with significant drawbacks as one needs to compute future steps which will not be used to update the model parameters. In contrast, our approach makes use of past steps and is therefore less wasteful in terms of computation (note that this could be further sped-up using parallel computations, which cannot be done with Unrolled GAN). Experiments on toy datasets show the benefits of using the history (Chekhov GAN) in comparison to Unrolled GAN (Figure 7). We have now added more experimental results comparing to Unrolled GAN in terms of Inception Score and FID, where we can clearly see that our approach achieves significantly better scores (Table 5, Figure 4 and Figure 11).\n\n2) The mixture GAN approach suggested in Arora et al: We agree with the reviewer that a comparison to this work is valuable and we have now added the requested results to the updated version of the paper (Table 5). These results demonstrate that our approach achieves better results than Arora et al. when both methods are applied on top of WGAN, despite having 5 times less trainable parameters. Applying both methods on top of GAN yields comparable scores, but with notably less variance for Chekhov GAN.\n\n\n3) WGAN & WGAN-GP: As requested by the reviewer, we have added a comparison to WGAN and WGAN GP in Table 5 in the paper where we clearly see better scores for Chekhov GAN. Note that although we originally developed our approach for the vanilla GAN, a similar algorithm can be applied to the Wasserstein objective which is also a min-max objective. As a proof of concept, we also provide empirical results for our approach with the Wasserstein objective and show that it also consistently improves upon the baseline.\n\nIn summary, Chekhov GAN outperforms GAN over various metrics (MSE, number of missing modes, reverse KL divergence, number of generated classes, missing modes due to catastrophic forgetting) and achieves comparable performance in terms of Inception Score and FID, with reduced variance. At the same time, we successfully apply our algorithm on top of WGAN and achieve consistent improvement. We further show improvement across several other baselines as well. \n\nAs you have mentioned, our algorithm has theoretical guarantees which we believe are of significant interest for the GAN literature. The practical algorithm is strongly inspired by the theory (using the history of generators and discriminators and updating the parameters by taking a gradient step guided by the FTRL objective) and outperforms the baselines across several metrics and datasets. Closing the gap between the theory and practice would be an interesting direction for future work as there are clear theoretical benefits.\n", "title": "Updated version includes the requested experimental results"}, "S19bDv9mG": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rycH3LVbz", "comment": "Dear Leon,\n\nThank you for your comment!\n\nThere are two reasons for that: \n-First, we wanted to make a fair comparison to the standard training method, which uses one update rather than several upades per round.\n-Second, we have noticed that for our method, using several updates vs. a single update did not make a big difference. We therefore decided to present the experiments with a single update which is more practical.\n", "title": "More practical while retaining performance"}, "Sy6RLv9Qf": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BkKnrjN-z", "comment": "Dear Leon,\n\nThank you for your interest!\n\nIn the example that you have raised the (theoretic) FTRL approach will not lead to mode collapse. \nIn order to see why this is the case, let\u2019s formalize your example:\n-Assume that the true data is uniformly distributed between [10,12].\n-Also assume that the generator can choose a single parameter \\mu which induces a uniform distribution between [\\mu-1, \\mu+1].\n-Assume that the discriminator may choose two parameters W and b; this induces the following classification rule:  \u201c+1\u201d if Wx+b>0, and \u201c0\u201d otherwise.\n\nIn your example, the initial parameters are, \\mu = -11, and W=1, b=0. \nNow, at the second round, the generator will choose a new \\mu which minimizes its loss. In our case this would lead to some \\mu>=1 (note that FTRL does not use gradient step, but rather full minimization).\nIn the next round, the discriminator will change W and b in order to separate between the generated and true data (if possible). In the following round, the generator will again update its parameters and so on\u2026 This process will persist until \\mu converges to \\mu=11, which is the true data.\n\nThe reason that the FTRL approach converges is that it does not rely only on gradient information but rather on more global information.\n\nNote that the example you raised is indeed a hurdle for the standard GAN optimization method, and all other approaches that rely on gradients, including our practical algorithm (unless we inject additive noise to the samples that we feed into the discriminator, which is a common practice for training GANs).\n\nThe question you raised highlights the potential benefits of implementing the full FTRL approach, which we hope would inspire/be addressed in future work.", "title": "FTRL avoids mode collapse in the toy example"}}}
