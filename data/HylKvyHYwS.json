Recent developments in machine learning have opened new opportunities for industrial innovations such as self-driving cars. However, many machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and industrial practitioners are concerned about accidents arising from misclassification. To avoid critical misclassifications, we define a sample that is likely to be mislabeled as a suspicious sample. Our main idea is to apply a framework of learning with rejection and adversarial examples to assist in the decision making for such suspicious samples. We propose two frameworks, learning with rejection under adversarial attacks and learning with protection. Learning with rejection under adversarial attacks is a naive extension of the learning with rejection framework for handling adversarial examples. Learning with protection is a practical application of learning with rejection under adversarial attacks. This algorithm transforms the original multi-class classification problem into a binary classification for a specific class, and we reject suspicious samples to protect a specific label. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in experiments.", "keywords": ["Learning with Rejection", "Adversarial Examples"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper addresses the setting of learning with rejection while incorporating the ideas from learning with adversarial examples to tackle adversarial attacks. While the reviewers acknowledged the importance to study learning with rejection in this setting, they raised several concerns: (1) lack of technical contribution -- see R1\u2019s and R2\u2019s related references, see R3\u2019s suggestion on designing c(x); (2) insufficient empirical evidence -- see R3\u2019s comment about the sensitivity experiment on the strength of the attack, see R1\u2019s suggestion to compare with a baseline that learns the rejection function such as SelectiveNet;  (3) clarity of presentation -- see R2\u2019s suggestions how to improve clarity.\nAmong these, (3) did not have a substantial impact on the decision, but would be helpful to address in a subsequent revision. However, (1) and (2) make it very difficult to assess the benefits of the proposed approach, and were viewed by AC as critical issues.\nAC can confirm that all three reviewers have read the author responses and have revised the final ratings. AC suggests, in its current state the manuscript is not ready for a publication.

The essential idea is, while predicting on a point x, we can reject classifying the point if it has an adversarial example very close to it. So, the algorithm can be simply summarized as,\n1. Learn a classifier function f\n2. On the test set, predict on a point, only if it doesn't have an adversarial example close by.\n\nI am inclined to reject the paper for the following reasons:\n1. The proposed approach is a variation of a fairly well-known heuristic. Having a close adversarial example is same as saying that the current point is very close to the decision boundary. Being close to the decision boundary is a heuristic that has been applied in multiple scenarios in machine learning.\n2. The proposed approach is not novel. For example, [1] uses adversarial example style detection to augment their training data and improve their end-to-end model. \n3.

It first naively extends the learning with rejection framework for handling adversarial examples. It then considers the classical cost-sensitive learning by transfer the multi-class problem into binary classification problem through one-vs-all and using the technique they proposed to reject predictions on non-important labels, and name such technique as \u201clearning with protection\u201d. Finally, they do some experimental studies. \n\nThe paper does not show any connection between \u201clearning with rejection\u201d and \u201cadversarial learning\u201d. The method it proposes is also a na\u00efve extension of existing methods. Both the problem setting and the technique does not have novelty. The paper fails to realize that the motivated application is actually called \u201ccost-sensitive learning\u201d and has been studied long time before. The paper also has problems in writing. Finally, there is no comparison with any baseline. Only empirical results of the proposed methods are shown. Due to all these reasons, there is still a long way to go before the paper can be published. I will rate it a clear rejection.\n\nMore specially, \n\nThe definition of \u201csuspicious example\u201d in Sec.3.1 has no relationship with adversary examples.

It is called cost-sensitive learning in machine learning and can date back to 2001:\nCharles Elkan. The Foundations of Cost-Sensitive Learning. IJCAI 2001: 973-978.\nWhere they study the same problem when misclassifying one class of data may cost a lot than misclassifying another class of data. The current paper has not discussed any related work of cost-sensitive learning although they want to study a problem in its field. \n\nThe paper should be also improved in writing in the following aspects. \nThere is a lot of inaccurate statements in the paper. For example,  \u201cIn Sections 3 and 4, we propose and describe our algorithm\u201d, what is the difference between propose and describe? \u201can estimator \\hat h might return result that differ greatly from h^* in a case with finite samples\u201d. Actually there are rigorous theoretical results describing how the number of finite samples will impact the estimator \\hat h on unseen data. For example, \nPeter L. Bartlett, Shahar Mendelson. Rademacher and Gaussian Complexities: Risk Bounds and Structural Results. JMLR, 2002.\nSo inaccurate/unclear statements that will mislead readers should be avoided. \n\nIn writing, the paper also lacks the necessary references in many places. For example, \u201cLearning with rejection is a classification scenario where the learner is given the option to reject an instance instead of predicting its label.\u201d, \u201c\u2026classifies adversary attacks to two types of attacks, white-box attack and black-box attack.\u201d, \u201cMethods for protecting against these adversarial examples are also being proposed.\u201d. Necessary references are needed for these places.\n\nThe organization is also problematic. For example, in the second half of Sec.2 introducing two kinds of learning with rejection models, it should be included in a \u201crelated work\u201d part. \n\n------------------------------------------\nThank you for the rebuttal.

The considered problem is well-motivated and introduced, and I\u2019m unaware of prior work studying classification with reject option in the context of adversarial examples. However, I think there are different dimensions along which the paper could be improved:\n\n- My understanding of classification with a reject option is that the rejection cost c(x) is a design choice that can depend on the specific application. While c(x) is introduced as part of the framework it is then derived in a very specific way, removing the design aspect or at least not explaining very clearly how one would design it.

What if the attacker is stronger in the sense that it runs significantly more PGD iterations than used to compute the rejection function?

Our replies to the questions are listed below.\n\nQ1. My understanding of classification with a reject option is that the rejection cost c(x) is a design choice that can depend on the specific application. \nA1. In this paper, we proposed a new framework of applying learning with rejection to adversarial examples. As far as we know, there is no method based on a similar idea. As you pointed out, we also think that we should design our algorithm to enable us to control c(x). However, there are other difficulties in the theoretical justification for it. Therefore, based on this paper, we tackle the problem of designing c(x) in the next research.\n\nQ2. The rejection function r(x) relies on z^* which essentially amounts to computing an adversarial perturbation for a given testing point, see (2). The authors state that they use a 30-step of the PGD algorithm to find z^*. The attacks on which the method is tested only uses 10 PGD steps. What if the attacker is stronger in the sense that it runs significantly more PGD iterations than used to compute the rejection function? How sensitive is the rejection function to different initializations?\nA2. We also think that we need to increase the number of iterations of PGD when an attacker uses a stronger PGD attack. Following your opinion, in the next revision, we will show the sensitivity by experiment.\n\nQ3. Similarly, what happens if the attacker and the rejection function rely on different norms to compute the attack and the rejection score, respectively? I think it is important to investigate this aspect.\nA3. We have shown the results in Table 2. In the experiments, we used l_inf norm to reject suspicious samples and l_2 norm to attack the model. We confirmed that the proposed method is effective against an unexpected attack.\n\nQ4.  In Tables 1 and 2, I don\u2019t understand why the precision is the same for all rows corresponding to the same attack (strength), while the other metrics vary.\nA4. The proposed algorithm rejects suspicious samples. Therefore, it does not change the numbers of samples that are predicted as positive. It means that the numbers of true positive and false positive do not change. Because precision = TP/(TP+FP), precision also does not change. Even though precision does not change, we showed the result to evaluate the algorithm.", "title": "Response to AnonReviewer3"}, "rkgA_QI3sr": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Sye1YXKatH", "comment": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you for your insightful comments.

For example, [1] uses adversarial example style detection to augment their training data and improve their end-to-end model. \nA1. The idea of our paper is different from that of Wang et al. [1]'s paper. They augmented their samples using adversarial examples. On the other hand, we reject some samples that will mislead the learner's decision making. The idea of Wang et al. [1]'s paper is similar to adversarial training. However, it is well known that adversarial training can be a cat\u2010and\u2010mouse game, i.e., a model trained by adversarial training is still weak against a different attack that is not assumed in the training process. Because training a robust model is a difficult task as many existing works pointed out, our idea is to propose a new way of decision making to deal with adversarial examples by introducing a rejection option. \n\nQ2. There have been approaches which attempt to learn rejection function [2], so it would have been good to at least do a comparison of the proposed approach with such methods.\nA2. We agree with your opinion. In fact, in the next research, we should consider learning a rejection function and classifier together. However, because the paper [2] does not consider the existence of adversarial examples, we consider that the method proposed in [2] is weak against adversarial examples.
