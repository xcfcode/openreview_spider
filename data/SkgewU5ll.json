Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts.", "keywords": ["Deep learning", "Applications"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The reviewers all agreed that the paper was well written, that the proposed approach is very sensible and intuitive and that the experiments are convincing.

Our responses to your questions are listed below:\n\n1) We would like to clarify that GRAM is not a graph-regularized Med2Vec. Actually GRAM comes from very different design philosophy. Med2Vec is an unsupervised method to perform two-level embedding of medical codes and visits, facilitating interpretation when connected to a static model such as logistic regression. GRAM is a general framework for any neural network-based supervised predictive model that enables the utilization of DAG-based prior knowledge to cope with data insufficiency.\n\n2) We showed the contribution of the prior knowledge in the paper by comparing GRAM with RandomDAG, RNN and RNN+ where GRAM consistently showed better predictive performance. Furthermore, if we are to plug Med2Vec to the RNN, we should also use Med2Vec to initialize the basic embeddings of GRAM for a fair comparison.\nOut of curiosity, we conducted an additional experiment where we trained a Med2Vec model with Sutter HF cohort, connected the Med2Vec weights to the RNN, then fine-tuned the Med2Vec weights as we trained the RNN for HF prediction. The predictive performance was similar to RNN+. This was expected, because, from our experience, we found that RNN was already a powerful sequence prediction model, and initializing the embedding weights with some co-occurrence-based methods such as Skip-gram or Med2Vec would provide limited improvement as opposed to using domain knowledge such as GRAM.", "title": "re: How that compares to your KDD 2016 paper"}, "BJ71Y_S8l": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "BJhmMPbNl", "comment": "We would like to thank you for your questions and insightful comments. We address your comments in detail below.\n\n1. Using the knowledge base factorization approach or graph convolutional approach?\nAs discussed in the Related Work section, knowledge base factorization methods such as Neural Tensor Network [Socher et al. 2013], TransE [Bordes et al. 2013] or TransH [Wang et al. 2014] learn the representations of entities and their relations in the knowledge graph, in order to perform tasks such as link prediction, triple classification or knowledge completion. Our goal, on the other hand, is fundamentally different in that we do not aim to learn the structure of the ontology (i.e. learning the entities and various relationships between entities), but focus on the parent-child relationship between medical concepts and learn how to properly combine the ancestors in the knowledge DAG to obtain robust representations for medical concepts under data insufficiency.\nGraph convolutional approaches such as Planetoid [Yang et al. 2016] or GCN [Kipf and Welling 2016] focus on learning the node representations to mainly perform node classification. Similar to the works mentioned above, they use the graph itself as the main data and perform prediction tasks for that graph. Our work, on the other hand, uses longitudinal EHR as the main data and perform prediction tasks for that EHR, using the knowledge DAG as the supplementary information. Also, graph convolutional approaches are similar to DeepWalk [Perozzi et al. 2014] or node2vec [Glover and Leskovec 2016] mentioned in the Related Work section in that they focus on graphs with flat hierarchy where all nodes are equal whereas GRAM utilizes hierarchical relationship (i.e. parent-child) of nodes.\nWe added more works to discuss them in the Related Work section.\n\n2. Regarding the fine-tuning of the nodes\nWe apologize for the confusion caused by our previous response. The basic embeddings of both leaf nodes and non-leaf nodes are fine-tuned during the training process, since the error signal flows from the output \\widehat{y}_t to the final representations g_i's which are convex combinations of the basic embeddings e_i's. We apologize for the confusion. We clarified this in the manuscript.\n\n3. Figure 2. Please use the same image format with the same resolution.\nWe replaced Figure 2 with tables for better readability. Also Figure 6 in the Appendix was replaced with tables as well.", "title": "Authors' response"}, "HJd_d_rLx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HywiEvWEx", "comment": "Thank you for your review and clarifying questions. We address your questions in detail below.\n\n1. Why is there a softmax in equation 4, given that the loss is multivariate cross-entropy (in the predicted visit, several codes could be equal to 1), not a single-class cross-entropy?\nThe loss function in section 2.3 is a binary cross-entropy for each code we are predicting.\nIt is true that multiple codes could be 1 in a single visit. Considering this, we also experimented with a set of sigmoid functions, one for each code. But using the Softmax function showed better predictive performance. We believe this is due to the strong regularizing effect caused by the normalizing denominator of Softmax. Also, although there could be multiple codes equal to 1 in a single visit, the average number of codes per visit is limited to 2 in Sutter dataset and 13 in MIMIC-III dataset, and Softmax seems sufficient to capture that code distribution.\n\n2. What is the embedding dimension m?\nThe embedding dimension m is the size of the vector we used to represent the nodes (i.e. medical concepts) in the knowledge DAG. The values of m we used in the experiments, along with other hyperparameters, are described in Table 4 in Appendix C.", "title": "Authors' response"}, "SkMJ__rIg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "ByxbiBc4g", "comment": "Thank you for your review and your insightful questions. Our responses to your comments are as below.\n\n1. Why is the patient\u2019s visit taken as just the sum of medical codes found in the visit, and not say the average or a learned weighted average? Wouldn\u2019t this bias for/against the number of codes in the visit?\nThe sum of medical codes is a natural approach as a patient (or a visit) can be viewed as the aggregate of medical symptoms and diseases, as opposed to averaging, which does not capture the complexity of the patient status. Your suggestion on the learned weighted average is related to one of our future research directions. Applying another attention mechanism to weight-sum the code embeddings could be a better way of representing a visit. However, under a proper supervised setting, the embedding matrix for the codes would learn values that incorporates the attention weights as well. This could potentially be an interesting comparison and can be a focus for another paper.\n \n2. I don\u2019t see why basic embeddings are not fine tuned as well. Did you find that to hurt performance? Do you have an explanation for that?\nWe apologize for the confusion. As we explained in the response for the first review, the basic embeddings for both leaf nodes and non-leaf nodes are fine-tuned, since the error signal flows from the output \\widehat{y}_t to the final representations of the code g_i\u2019s, which are convex combinations of the basic embeddings e_i\u2019s. We again apologize for the confusion. We clarified this in the paper.\n \n3. Looking at Figure 2, the results seem very close and the figures are not very clear (figure (b) top is missing). Also, I am wondering how significant the differences are so it would be nice to comment on that.\nWe replaced Figure 2 with tables for better readability. We also replaced Figure 6 in the Appendix with tables. In sequential diagnoses prediction, especially for MIMIC-III where the training data is even smaller, GRAM+ shows significantly better performance compared to RNN and RNN+ (maximum 6% improved AUC for Sutter PAMF dataset, 10% improved AUC for MIMIC-III) for infrequent codes. SimpleRollUp is quite effective since it is also uses prior knowledge.\nFor HF prediction, GRAM and GRAM+ consistently outperform other baselines. I believe these improvements are quite significant and hard to achieve given that the strong baseline performance (AUC>.8). We added more descriptions to the paper to emphasize the performance differences.\n \n4. Finally, I think this is an interesting application paper applying well-established deep learning techniques. The paper deals with an important issue that arises when applying deep learning models in domains with scarce data resources. However, I would like the authors to comment on what there paper offers as new insights to the ICLR community and why they think ICLR is a good avenue for their work.\nThank you for appreciating the value of this work. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply the attention mechanism to a graph (DAG to be precise) in order to augment prior knowledge when learning representations. We believe that we have shown this to be not only viable, but also quite effective. We believe our work will invite the exciting follow-up research in both deep learning methods as well as important applications to healthcare to 1) invent different, or even better methods to apply attention on graphs and 2) introduce various graph-based knowledge to learn robust representations in healthcare as well as other fields.", "title": "Authors' response"}, "SJ54UurLe": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkgewU5ll", "comment": "Major changes in the revision\n-- Figures 2 are replaced with tables for better readability\n-- Related works have been expanded\n-- Incorporated the reviewers\u2019 comments in the experiment section.\n-- Experiments for GRAM+ and RNN+ in heart failure prediction were re-run\n\nMore details\nWe discovered that, for GRAM+ and RNN+ in HF prediction with varying amounts of training data, we initialized the basic embeddings e_i\u2019s and the embedding matrix W_emb with GloVe vectors that were trained always on the 100% training data instead of the downsampled training data.

SDP tries to predict the occurrence of  diagnosis codes in the next visit V_{t+1} based on the information of past co-occurring diagnosis codes V_1, ..., V_t, as opposed to predicting a binary label for the entire sequence in HF task. The co-occurrence information infused by the initialized embedding technique significantly improves the performance of SDP, because it is more about finding co-occurrence of the codes including the same codes repeating over time. The dataset we used for the HF prediction task is a subset of the large Sutter PAMF dataset, which has also been used for one of the two SDP tasks (The construction of the HF dataset  is described in Appendix B).
