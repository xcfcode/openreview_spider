Given a natural language sentence, LUA scores all the valid segmentation candidates and utilizes dynamic programming (DP) to extract the maximum scoring one. LUA enjoys a number of appealing properties such as inherently guaranteeing the predicted segmentation to be valid and facilitating globally optimal training and inference. Besides, the practical time complexity of LUA can be reduced to linear time, which is very efficient. We have conducted extensive experiments on 5 tasks, including syntactic chunking, named entity recognition (NER), slot filling, Chinese word segmentation, and Chinese part-of-speech (POS) tagging, across 15 datasets. Our models have achieved the state-of-the-art performances on 13 of them. The results also show that the F1 score of identifying long-length segments is notably improved.", "keywords": ["Neural Sequence Labeling", "Neural Sequence Segmentation", "Dynamic Programming"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper is concerned with sequence segmentation. The authors introduce a framework which they call 'lexical unit analysis' - a neural network is used to score spans and then dynamic programming is used to find the best scoring overall segmentation. The authors present extensive experiments on various Chinese NLP tasks, obtaining better results than the systems they compare to.\n\nReviewers raised concerns, including about novelty. In my view, beyond beating the state of the baselines on the chosen tasks, it is hard to extract an actionable insight or novel conceptual understanding.

LUA scores all the valid segmentation of a sequence and uses Dynamic Programming to find the segmentation with the highest score. In addition, LUA can incorporate labeling of the segment as an additional component for span labeling tasks. \n\nPros:\n1. LUA overcomes the shortages of sequence labeling as a token-based tagging method and span-based models as well, by treating them separately.\n2. The decomposition of scoring label and scoring span allows the pre-computation of the maximum label score for each span, reducing the complexity.\n3. This method achieve the state of the art performance on 13 out of 15 data sets empirically.\n\nCons:\n1. The novelty is incremental, as the idea of calculating span-based score and label-based score with DP has been used widely in constituent parsing, which applies interval DP in a similar way. Also check semi-CRF model (Sunita Sarawagi and William W. Cohen, 2004).\n2. The way of using neural model to calculate the span-based scoring seems to be very arbitrary (Eq3), without any explanation why it is designed in this way.\n3. Label correlations are used to mimic correlation scoring, however the transition between spans are not explicitly modeled.\n\nQuestions:\n1. LUA is only used in inference stage. Do you think by using LUA in training as well, though slower, the performance can be further improved?\n2.

For example, at training time, we use DP to compute f(\\hat{y}) for inducing the max-margin loss (see Eq. (8)). This consistency guarantees that LUA is capable of overcoming the label bias problem. \n\nComment-2: It is not clear how DP contributes to the success of the model, as the scores for segments are derived during the training (which seems most of the success is coming from the labeled data (i.e. supervised training) and BERT encoding).\n\nAnswer-2: There are three important facts: 1) the tasks in text segmentation are all supervised learning; 2) most of our baselines adopt BERT as the sequence encoder; 3) DP is consistently used in both training and inference. Therefore, the achieved promising performances are not attributed to labeled data or BERT but to its attractive properties.

Do you think by using LUA in training as well, though slower, the performance can be further improved?\n\nAnswer-1: DP is used for both training and inference in a consistent manner. As shown in Eq. (8), at training time, we use DP to calculate f(\\hat{y}) for inducing the max-margin loss. Besides, in our preliminary experiments, we find that not using DP in training severely degrades the performances. Although DP is involved in training, its running time is still competitive. As shown in Table 6, it is even faster than BERT+CRF by about 1 minute for one training epoch.\n\nQuestion-2: Do you have any intuition of why designing the scoring function (Eq3) in that way? \n\nAnswer-2: The design of Eq. (3) is inspired by the Eq. (14) in ESIM [Chen et al., Enhanced LSTM for Natural Language Inference, ACL 2017]. We will clarify this in the revised version. \n\nComment-3: The novelty is incremental, as the idea of calculating span-based score and label-based score with DP has been used widely in constituent parsing, which applies interval DP in a similar way.

However, they suffer from many problems that are described in Introduction (Section 1). Our proposed LUA solves all of them and have obtained new state-of-the-art results on 13 datasets. Span-based constituent parsers can\u2019t capture the label correlations among constituents and semi-CRF is still an extension of CRF. LUA is highly light-weight and very effective. We strongly believe that LUA will have a great impact on future research.\n\nComment-4: Label correlations are used to mimic correlation scoring, however the transition between spans are not explicitly modeled.\n\nAnswer-4: This is an interesting direction and we will explore it in future work.

We will clarify the differences between them and our work. The proposed LUA has made significant contributions to NLP. Currently, the dominant approaches to text segmentation are sequence labeling and span-based models. However, they suffer from many problems, which have been made clear in Introduction (Section 1).
