Therefore, I have reduced my score.\n\n\nSummary:\n\n\nThe paper studies the well-known Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and shows the rate of convergence to the solution of an ordinary differential equation recently proposed by [Su et al, 2014]. Motivated by the proof, the authors then derive a new accelerated method with a faster rate of convergence than the original Nesterov's method, which is shown to be more stable than the original Nesterov's method when the step size is large. The method is combined with the proximal operator into a new algorithm referred to as modified FISTA, which is then applied to the matrix completion problem. \n\n\nStrengths:\n\n- The paper proves the convergence rate of Nesterov's method to the ODE proposed by [Su et al, 2014]. This proof then motivates them to derive a new faster accelerated method where the truncation error has a higher order of $O(h^4)$ compared to $O(h^3)$ in case of Nesterov's method.\n- It is shown in two simple examples that the new method is more stable as it can work with larger step sizes. \n- The method is applied to a matrix completion problem, where it is shown to have faster convergence than standard FISTA and Nesterov's gradient method.\n\n\nConcerns:\n\n- In Section 2.2., the purpose of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 is not clear without looking into the proof of Theorem 2 in the supplementary material. The flow of the paper could be improved if an intuition was given of which role they play in the proof of Theorem 2.\n- Similarly, to understand the motivation for the derivation of the new accelerated method in Section 3, one is required to look at the proof of the convergence in the supplement. Also here it would help to provide a detailed motivation for the derivations already in Section 3.\n- In the numerical results in Figure 1, the gap $|F(x_n) \u2212 F(x^*)|$ (y-axis) does not seem to monotonically decrease but jump up and down erratically. Also there are periodic wave-like patterns visible in the plot. Why do we see those patterns?\n- The resulting accelerated numerical method is never explicitly written down, only the specific version derived for the matrix completion problems. The paper would be better understandable if the general numerical scheme (accelerated method) was written down in form of an algorithm after Section 3.\n- In the end of Section 4, a reference to Algorithm 2 is missing. Moreover, Figure 2 and Figure 3 are never referenced in the text.\n- Page 2, after (1.2) -> \"achive\" -> \"achieve\"\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe proposed method provides a theoretical contribution to the understanding of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. Moreover, a novel algorithm is proposed which is shown to have a faster convergence to the underlying ODE. In the paper this is shown only for a matrix completion problem but I feel that this new algorithm could be adopted by the community if further experiments prove its worth. On the other hand, the flow and presentation of the paper could be improved.

We respond to your questions and comments in detail below.\n>There is no theoretical guarantee on the convergence (rate) to a solution of an optimization problem.\n\nFirstly, we believe that our theory means convergence. We would like to give a short explanation. Dynamic system theory guarantees that the continuous flow $x(t)$ (solution of the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+\\frac{3}{t}\\dot{x}+\\nabla F(x)=0$) converges to an optimal point $x^*$ as $t\\to\\infty$. So for any small $\\varepsilon$, we can find a constant $T$ such that for $t\\geq T$, $|x(t)-x^*|<\\varepsilon$ always satisfies. Theorem 2 shows that $x_n\\;(n=T/h)$ converges to $x(T)$ as $h\\to\\infty$. So for sufficiently small $h$, the distance between $x_n$ and $x^*$ is not larger than $\\varepsilon$.\nSecondly, we agree that the convergence rate of the new method is important. Since the performance of our new method is better, we believe that our method also achieves the optimal convergence rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})$ as Nesterov's method does. Furthermore, due to existence of a $1/s$ term in the convergence rate of Nesterov's method, we believe that our new method improves the convergence by working with larger step size $s$. We leave this point for further research.\n>The reason why we care \"large\" step sizes seem insufficient, while Nesterov's method is stable for normal step sizes (e.g., $1/L$).\n\nFirstly, we would like to explain why we care large step size. We prove that Nesterov's method and our new method converge to an optimal solution $x^*$ along the same flow $x(t)$. Therefore, larger step size (i.e. better stability) implies faster convergence. This is the reason of better performance of our new method in experiments.\nBesides, we agree that $1/L$ step size ensures the stability of Nesterov's method, which is an important result. In our newly added subsection 3.3, we prove the absolutely stable region of Nesterov's method is $s\\cdot\\nabla^2F\\in[0,4/3]$. Actually, the bound of $\\nabla^2F$ is Lipschitz constant $L$, so our theoretical result is approximately coincides with classic choice of step size $1/L$. Furthermore, we prove theoretically that the absolutely stable region of our new method is three times as large as Nesterov's method, which theoretically confirms the choice of larger step size.\n>It is not clear when the step size is considered large, other than using an exhaustive search. Unlike Nesterov's method, the interval of step sizes that guarantee convergence to a solution is not known for the proposed method.\n\nWe have revised our paper and added a part (subsection 3.3 Absolute stability of Nesterov\u2019s method and the new method) to theoretically explain the better stability of our new method. In this part, we prove that the absolutely stable region of the new method is $s\\cdot\\nabla^2F\\in[0,4]$, where $s$ denotes the step size. This is a theoretical result about choosing step size. We would like to emphasize that the absolutely stable region of Nesterov's method is $s\\cdot\\nabla^2F\\in[0,4/3]$.

We respond to your questions and comments in detail below.\n>The biggest concern that I have with the paper is that it is unclear to me whether the convergence rate is really improved or not. From my understanding, truncation error is different from the convergence rate. What does Theorem 3 really imply here? It seems to me that Theorem 3 does not guarantee that there is an improvement in the convergence rate. A rigorous quantification of the convergence rate needs to be provided to justify the claim \"the proposed method converges faster.\"\n\nThe algorithm performance is improved because our new algorithm can work with larger step size when converges to one optimal point $x^*$ along the continuous flow $x(t)$ which is also the limit flow of Nesterov's method. As a result, our new method is more stable and converges faster. We give a theoretical proof of the chosen of larger step size via absolutely stable theory in subsection 3.3 ($4/3$ for Nesterov's method and $4$ for our new method).
