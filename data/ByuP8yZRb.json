The revised version does address my concerns. The fact that the paper does not come with substantial theoretical contributions/justification still stands out.\n\n---\n\nThe authors present a variant of the adversarial feature learning (AFL) approach by Edwards & Storkey. AFL aims to find a data representation that allows to construct a predictive model for target variable Y, and at the same time prevents to build a predictor for sensitive variable S. The key idea is to solve a minimax problem where the log-likelihood of a model predicting Y is maximized, and the log-likelihood of an adversarial model predicting S is minimized. The authors suggest the use of multiple adversarial models, which can be interpreted as using an ensemble model instead of a single model.\n\nThe way the log-likelihoods of the multiple adversarial models are aggregated does not yield a probability distribution as stated in Eq. 2. While there is no requirement to have a distribution here - a simple loss term is sufficient - the scale of this term differs compared to calibrated log-likelihoods coming from a single adversary. Hence, lambda in Eq. 3 may need to be chosen differently depending on the adversarial model. Without tuning lambda for each method, the empirical experiments seem unfair. This may also explain why, for example, the baseline method with one adversary effectively fails for Opp-L. A better comparison would be to plot the performance of the predictor of S against the performance of Y for varying lambdas. The area under this curve allows much better to compare the various methods.\n\nThere are little theoretical contributions. Basically, instead of a single adversarial model - e.g., a single-layer NN or a multi-layer NN - the authors propose to train multiple adversarial models on different views of the data. An alternative interpretation is to use an ensemble learner where each learner is trained on a different (overlapping) feature set. Though, there is no theoretical justification why ensemble learning is expected to better trade-off model capacity and robustness against an adversary. Tuning the architecture of the single multi-layer NN adversary might be as good?\n\nIn short, in the current experiments, the trade-off of the predictive performance and the effectiveness of obtaining anonymized representations effectively differs between the compared methods. This renders the comparison unfair. Given that there is also no theoretical argument why an ensemble approach is expected to perform better, I recommend to reject the paper.", "title": "Minor theoretical contribution; main focus on experiments", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "SJtlwgqlf": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ByuP8yZRb", "review": "- The authors propose the use of multiple adversaries over random subspaces of features in adversarial feature learning to produce censoring representations.

Indeed judging from the large variance in the accuracy of predicting S in Table 1a-c for single adversaries, I suspect one of the main advantage of the current MARS method comes from variance reduction.

We replace the results of each baseline by optimizing hyper-parameter $lambda$ for each baseline (following reviewer 2's concern). The results show that the proposed method still achieves performance improvements compared to baselines (w/ single adversary and w/ multiple adversaries over entire feature spaces). Please see the Table 1, Figure 2, and related paragraphs for more detail. The procedure for the hyperparameter selection is described at the end of section 4.1. \nNote that, the original version of the manuscript also shows the performance with $\\lambda$ varied for some baselines ($Adv_{0.1}, MA_{0.1}$), so this revision is not entirely new in the final manuscript. \n\n(2) Figure 3. We added analysis of the effect of variance reduction (following reviewer 1's comment). \nIn response to the comment of review 1, we compared the effect of variance reduction among baselines and the proposed method. The results show that MARS tend to give superior performance to MA although both methods have almost similar variance, suggesting that the variance-reduction is not main advantage of the proposed method. Please see the Figure 3-a for more detail. We also add the proper explanation to the beginning of section 3.1. \nWe also add analysis on relationships between accuracy of discriminators and the final performance of AFL, to clarify key factor for the success of AFL. The results support that our underlying assumption, i.e., the capacity/accuracy of the adversary is not the dominant factor. Please refer the Figure 3-b for more detail. \n\n(3) Abstract and paragraph 3--5 in Introduction. \nAs we have mentioned in the responses for reviewer's feedbacks, the primary contribution of our paper is (1) we proposed the novel design of adversary for AFL, and (2) it achieved state-of-the-art performance in several tasks related to the censoring representations. This is significant because the results shed light on the importance of the design of adversary, and gives new implications about the design. It is worth mentioning that, except our paper, all existing studies focus only on the {\\em accuracy/capacity} for designing adversaries, which is not enough for improving the performance of AFL as shown in this paper. Moreover, the task itself is essential for using the power of Deep Neural Networks in many real-world applications, as mentioned in the introduction of the manuscript. \nWe have revised abstract and paragraph 3--5 of the Introduction based on the above discussion. We hope this revision makes the contributions clearer. \n\n# Minor Revisions\n- Delete the Figure 2 in the original manuscript (since it overlaps with Table 1 to some extent). \n- Fix the grammatical and typographical mistakes\n- Add some detail about the experimental setting, following the question of review 1.

The area under this curve allows much better to compare the various methods.\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry for confusing you about the experimental settings. Although we have mentioned that \u201c The hyper-parameter is set to 1.0, 1.0, 0.1 for Opp-G, Opp-L, and USC-HAD respectively\u201d, these are {\\em not fixed} thorough out the experiments. We tuned the $lambda$ of baselines ($Adv_{0.1}$ $MA_{0.1}$ in Table 2). It indeed increase the performances; however the proposed method still outperforms the baselines. Note that, we also tested the case where $\\lambda = {0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 1.0}$, but the results are consistent,. though we have removed it due to the tight space limitation.  We\u2019d like to clarify this points and add some experimental results with different $\\lambda$ in the final manuscript. \n\nSecondly, I\u2019m afraid there is some misunderstanding regarding the Eq (2). It just averaging the $q_{D_k}$.  As the each $q_{D_k}$ is  calibrated, the averaged model is also calibrated (the sum of $q_D$ is 1.0). Although it is true that model averaging possibly tend to give smooth values and it make log-likelihood little bit differ, I don\u2019t think it needs special treatments except testing different hyper-parameters, as mentioned above.

This is significant because it shade a light on new design consideration for improving the performance of the AFL framework, as mentioned in abstract and introduction of our paper.

As the reviewer's comment, MARS is similar to random forest in surface (actually both methods could be regarded as the instantiation of more general method \"random subspace methods\"), and it is possible to some parts of the success come from variance reduction property, as with random forests. \n\nHowever, we are not fully agree that the main advantage of the MARS comes from variance reduction, based on the observations: (1) In the first place, the training of the discriminator(s) are {\\em not} suffered from large variance. Specifically, in the task of predicting $s$, almost no performance differences is observed between two subsets of datasets (training and validation) throughout the training. We will add some experimental results in the Appendix parts (2) As shown in figure 4-c, the classification performance of different hyper-parameter $\\alpha$ are almost equally raise at the beginning of training. Note that, $\\alpha=0.0$ corresponds to the MA, and $\\alpha=0.8$ corresponds to the MARS in the Table 1. Since the large variance make the training slower typically, it imply that the superior of the MARS to MA seems not come from only the variance reduction parts. \n\nRather, our results suggests that the usage of random subspaces make it hard to deceive discriminators (indicated by the high variance in figure 4-d). This is intuitive results as the encoder need to deceive discriminators that have various views, rather than the single view point. This makes the encoder need to be more stronger to beat the discriminators, and make the representations more invariant to the sensitive variable $S$ (as shown in Table1).  This is what we ephasized as \u201cvulnerableness\u201d in the current manuscript. \n\nAny way, we will definitely add some explanations about this topic (may be with making new subsection at the end of section 3). Again, thanks for the valuable reviews. \n\n\n> The definition of S, the private information set, is not clear.

Moreover, evaluation itself is too conservative to discuss about the practical usages because evaluator have too much labeled datasets.
