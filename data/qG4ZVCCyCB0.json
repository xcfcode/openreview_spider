A common practice in meta-learning is to perform a train-validation split where the prior adapts to the task on one split of the data, and the resulting predictor is evaluated on another split. Despite its prevalence, the importance of the train-validation split is not well understood either in theory or in practice, particularly in comparison to the more direct non-splitting method, which uses all the per-task data for both training and evaluation.\nWe provide a detailed theoretical study on the whether and when the train-validation split is helpful on the linear centroid meta-learning problem, in the asymptotic setting where the number of tasks goes to infinity. We show that the splitting method converges to the optimal prior as expected, whereas the non-splitting method does not in general without structural assumptions on the data. In contrast, if the data are generated from linear models (the realizable regime), we show that both the splitting and non-splitting methods converge to the optimal prior. Further, perhaps surprisingly, our main result shows that the non-splitting method achieves a strictly better asymptotic excess risk under this data distribution, even when the regularization parameter and split ratio are optimally tuned for both methods. Our results highlight that data splitting may not always be preferable, especially when the data is realizable by the model.

This paper shows that the best of the two approaches depends on the specific problem.\n\nStrength: It is easy to follow the paper and it is very convincing why the train-train approach could be better than the train-validation approach.\n\nWeakness: I am not an expert in meta-learning and I could be wrong with my comments. But my concerns are:\n\n1) Both inner loop and outer loop are solving the linear regression problems. In fact, because the estimate of the inner loop $\\mathcal{A}(w_0; X, y)$ is linear in $w_0$, we can combine the inner loop and outer loop together, and our estimate for $w_0$ is a linear regression estimate where the new features are constructed by the original features and response, and the loss is not only averaged by the sample size $n$ of each task but also the number of tasks $T$. It is unclear to me how ''this problem captures\nthe essence of meta-learning with non-linear models (such as neural networks) in practice'' as claimed on page 2. Furthermore, as $T$ goes to infinity, it becomes the classic linear regression regime where dimension fixed and sample size goes to infinity. Because of this, it is intuitive and looks straightforward to check that the train-validation split gives a consistent estimate and the train-train split gives a consistent estimate in the realizable setting but not in general. I would say to improve the significance of the paper, the authors could like at the regime where d, n, T both grows to infinity at certain rates e.g. $d=\\Theta(Tn)$.   \n\n2) One major reason that the train-validation split is inferior to the train-train split is that a significant amount of data is missed in the training. My question is why we do not apply K-fold cross-validation instead of a simple train-validation split. In the case of ridge regression, it is possible to do a leave-one-out cross-validation efficiently, i.e., we can obtain the leave-one-out prediction risk without fitting the regression $n$ times but using the estimate trained by the entire data. For general meta-learning, K-fold cross-validation should be a better approach than a train-validation split. In the linear regression setting, leave-one-out cross-validation should be a more proper approach. Then it will be kind of fair to compare K-fold cross-validation with the train-train split and it will be interesting to see train-train split can be still better.\n\n3) Because of the linear regression settings with $T\\rightarrow \\infty$, I think it is closely related to a Bayesian hierarchical model with the Gaussian prior on the coefficients (due to the ridge penalty in the inner loop). Is the Bayesian estimator be consistent as well when $T\\rightarrow infty$? Some discussion about this connection would be good.\n\nBecause of these concerns, I currently recommend a reject.

We respond to the questions as follows.\n\n**Significance of T -> infinity regime**\n\nWe believe our result is significant and not a trivial consequence of classical statistics theory. We agree that our inner and outer loop can be combined and give closed-form expressions for our estimators (train-train and train-val). However, our problem is still very different from classical asymptotic analysis of linear regression. \n\nThe key difference is that our train-train and train-val estimators have a two-level structure (see, e.g. Eq (10)), and thus are more complicated than \u201cpooled linear regression\u201d type estimators. In order to compare these two methods, we need to perform a \u201c$T\\to\\infty$ asymptotics with fixed $n$\u201d, rather than a pooled $Tn\\to\\infty$ asymptotics. Further, as $T\\to\\infty$ but $d,n$ are still comparable, our analysis required a precise understanding of the spectrum of $X_t^\\top X_t$ using techniques such as the Stieltjes transform (e.g. Theorem 9), as well as how the information between different tasks can be shared. These analyses are not present in classical statistics theory.\n\nWe also remark that our main technical contribution is in comparison of the asymptotic MSE (Theorem 4) for the two methods. Our consistency results (Prop 1-2, Thm 3) are agreeably more straightforward and presented for the purpose of setting up our Thm 4.\n\n**Why our problem captures essence of nonlinear meta-learning** \n\nInitially, we claimed this as our inner loop algorithm (biased ridge regression) is similar to gradient descent based finetuning of neural networks, which is used in practice (such as MAML). \n\nFurther, although our model is linear rather than neural networks, we already see the subtle, non-trivial comparison of train-train and train-val in Thm 4. Therefore we believe our problem already conveys an interesting theoretical bit for meta-learning in general. \n\n**Other scaling regimes, e.g. $d=\\Theta(Tn)$**\n\nWe think this is an interesting research question. $d=\\Theta(Tn)$ is another regime where we can compare the constants for the train-train and train-val method, as both methods will have a $O(1)$ excess risk. However, we believe this regime is technically not readily approachable, as we must instead pool the $Tn$ data from different tasks and analyze much more complicated random matrices. (The random matrices will be more involved than linear regression with $Tn$ data because of the meta-learning structure.)\n\nWe also remark that our $T\\gg d, n$ regime can indeed be a realistic setting for modeling the practice. For example, if we do 5-way classification on ImageNet (with 1000 classes), there would be $T={1000 \\choose 5}$ distinct tasks, which is much larger than the dimension / number of samples per task. \n\n**Cross-validation**\n\nWe think this is a great question too -- doing a \u201croulette\u201d K-fold multiple split should certainly reduce the variance of the train-val method (and make better use of the data). \n\nWe added a set of CV experiments in our simulation setting (Appendix E) and we find that K-fold CV can indeed improve over the naive train-val method, but still performs worse than train-train. We conjecture this may also be true in theory. However, currently it seems unclear to us how to rigorously prove this in theory, as cross-validation introduces undesired dependency in the loss functions (and makes the losses not iid). \n\n**Connection to Bayesian estimator**\n\nWe agree that our train-train meta-learning algorithm is close to the Bayesian estimator with a certain prior. We did some calculations and found out that the Bayesian estimator under a pretty natural prior is not exactly the same as our train-train algorithm. Therefore, even though classical results show that the Bayesian estimator is consistent (under the right model), such results do not imply our result. We have added the detailed derivation and some discussions of the Bayesian estimator in Appendix C.\n", "title": "Response"}, "XFZy6eExeXx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "_AMKAu33Lb", "comment": "Thank you for the valuable feedback! We respond to the comments as follows.\n\n**Delta over classical statistical theory, more sophisticated regularization**\n\nYeah, we are aware of methods such as AIC, BIC, or lasso for reducing the overfitting. However, even though our L2 (ridge) regularization is conceptually simpler than these and somewhat easier to analyze in standard linear regression, it is much harder to analyze in our meta-learning setting.\n\nFor example, our analysis of the optimally tuned train-train method involves non-trivial analyses of the spectrum such as random matrix theory and Steiltjes transform, which are not part of the classical statistical theory. Our analysis of the train-val method also involves novel technical arguments about the optimal regularization that are not present in classical statistical theory.\n\nGiven that such a simple and natural L2 regularized inner algorithm already yields new and subtle results like our Theorem 4 (prev. Corollary 8) for meta-learning, we believe our results have enough technical novelty and significance.\n\n**Corollary 6 (now Corollary 8) -- intuitions why no train & all validation is optimal?**\n\nOur intuition is that validation data is more \u201cvaluable\u201d in this case than training data, as the final loss is evaluated on the validation data. If the validation data is small, then the loss function as a function of $w_0$ will be very noisy even if the training data is large.\n\n**Other scaling regimes of $T, n, d$, e.g. they are all proportional**\n\nWe think this is a good research question indeed. However, we believe finding other scaling regimes where we can compare train-train and train-val can be difficult, as our comparison is only on the level of leading constant (in the AsymMSE), and specifying the constant is only possible by taking some asymptotics. If we only compare the O(.) style rates, then train-train likely has the same rate as train-val. \n\nWe think $d=\\Theta(Tn)$ may be one other possible regime to compare the constants (as suggested by AnonReviewer2). However, as we noted in that response, we believe we currently lack the technical tool for handling that case.\n\n**A more persuasive interpretation of Corollary 8 (now Thm 4)**\n\nWe believe the superior asymptotic MSE of the train-train method is due to the fact that the train-train method is able to use the data more efficiently (all the data goes into both training and validation) than the train-val method. We also note that while it is unclear whether this is theoretically true on other models as well, our real data experiments in Section 5.2 does support this finding on meta-learning with deep networks as well.\n\nWe have added the above discussion in our revision in the \u201cImplications\u201d paragraph after Thm 4.\n", "title": "Response"}, "mop0QuGcWAg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HkTwvaNaisi", "comment": "Thank you for the positive feedback.

Thus, my review will mostly focus on the results themselves, with the hope that other reviewers can better evaluate how this work compares to other work in the area.\n\nGlobally, I think the results of this paper are interesting. The proof of Theorem 7 (the trickiest result) is clever. I think the high-level structure of the paper could be improved and results better presented, but the \"core\" of the paper holds its ground. Per the disclaimer I cannot judge the novelty of the work. Overall I would lean towards acceptance.\n\n[pros]\n1. The central result of the paper is, in my mind, Corollary 8. Its precursor, Theorem 7, has a clever proof that was different from what I expected. Namely, I thought it would be based on linear spectral statistics results as found in Bai and Silverstein (2004), but instead they noticed their statistic of interest can be computed from the nice trick of directly differentiating (a generalization of) the Stieltjes transform. It's very elegant.\n\n2. I think Propositions 2-3 are the other interesting results, namely by showing that consistency of the methods are intimately linked to model specification.\n\n3. To obtain a workable theoretical analysis, the authors analyzed a simple linear model, (6). However, this model also leads to counterintuitive results, such as Corollary 6. What happens when the model is very flexible, like a neural net? Issues of model misspecification become less relevant, so one might think we are more in the setting of Section 4. However, it's possible that the gap in learning rates between train-val and train-train is an artifact of how simple the linear model is. I think the \"real data\" experiments in Section 5 are interesting in that respect and suggest that it remains true with deep models, so this is an important contribution as well.\n\n[cons]\n1. I think the structure of the paper could be much improved. Since Corollary 8 is the most important result, it should be given the status of a Theorem. Theorem 4, 5, and 7 should disappear. I think Corollary 6 and its ensuing discussion should disappear as well. Theorem 4 is ok, but maybe should be given a lesser status. I think if Proposition 2-3 could be merged into a single Theorem it would be nice too. I would try to eliminate or shorten as much as possible Section 2.1, I found this a bit distracting. The rest of Section 2 is fine for me. Otherwise, I would really emphasize the two scenarios: under model misspecification (Section 3) and under correct model specification with a working example, the linear model (Section 4), perhaps by changing the titles of the current sections. Finally, as discussed in my \"pro\" point 3, the \"real data\" experiments in Section 5 are really important, and it's a pity a lot of details are relegated to the appendix. Since I suggest cutting a lot of theoretical results, I would maybe bring back a lot of details currently dumped in Section A.2, since I think this deep, real data example is really crucial for making the case that the paper is relevant to normal practice.\n\n2. I would like to see more details as to why interchange of the derivative and both the limit and the integral is justified in the proof of Theorem 7 (uniform convergence).\n\nOther comments:\n- Calling \\hat{w}_{0, T}^{tr-val} in Proposition 2 an \"algorithm\" doesn't make much sense, I think \"estimator\" is more accurate.\n- There seems to be a major typo in the statement of Theorem 7: you talk of the train-val method but the math has tr-tr written.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Bai, Z.
