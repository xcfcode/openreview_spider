In the domain of intuitive physics, we study the task of visually predicting stability of block towers with the goal of understanding and influencing the model's reasoning. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce neural stethoscopes as a framework for quantifying the degree of importance of specific factors of influence in deep networks as well as for actively promoting and suppressing information as appropriate. In doing so, we unify concepts from multitask learning as well as training with auxiliary and adversarial losses. Secondly, we deploy the stethoscope framework to provide an in-depth analysis of a state-of-the-art deep neural network for stability prediction, specifically examining its physical reasoning. We show that the baseline model is susceptible to being misled by incorrect visual cues. This leads to a performance breakdown to the level of random guessing when training on scenarios where visual cues are inversely correlated with stability. Using stethoscopes to promote meaningful feature extraction increases performance from 51% to 90% prediction accuracy. Conversely, training on an easy dataset where visual cues are positively correlated with stability, the baseline model learns a bias leading to poor performance on a harder dataset. Using an adversarial stethoscope, the network is successfully de-biased, leading to a performance increase from 66% to 88%.", "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Intuitive Physics", "Stability Prediction", "Adversarial Training", "Auxiliary Training", "Multi-Task Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This submission proposes an interesting new approach on how to evaluate what features are the most useful during training. The paper is interesting and the proposed approach has the potential to be deployed in many applications, however the work as currently presented is demonstrated in a very narrow domain (stability prediction), as noted by all reviewers. Authors are encouraged to provide stronger experimental validation over more domains to show that their approach can truly improve over existing multitask frameworks."}, "review": {"HJe-nmVXTQ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B1lChPhJpQ", "comment": "Thank you for your review and the overall positive assessment. In particular, we are delighted that you see the potential of the stethoscope framework lending itself to much broader applications. We agree - particularly for applications regarding the interpretability of deep representations as well as the manipulation of biases contained therein. This is a key consideration in our belief that it makes for a valuable contribution to the community. \n\nWe have opted, in this submission, to focus on our primary application domain, which is intuitive physics. In particular, we demonstrate the efficacy of neural stethoscopes in interpreting, promoting and suppressing specific information in the context of the complex interplay between visual clues and physical properties in stability prediction. Our work is primarily motivated by the question as to what extent neural networks learn about physical principles or whether they merely follow visual clues and how we can guide the learning process. We showcase the stethoscope framework here to that effect and, based on its application, provide some interesting and novel [according to Reviewer 1] insights into representations for visual stability prediction.\n\nAs regards the implications of the paper, we would like to address this in the context of the reviewer\u2019s comment that increased performance is not surprising given the additional supervision provided. Our submission argues that the manner in which this information is provided really does matter. Figure 6 addresses this point in that multi-task learning fails to leverage the potential of the additional training labels (and, indeed, leads to a detrimental effect, Fig 6b) whereas the stethoscope framework allows the specification of whether the information considered should be promoted or suppressed. This leads to the performance gains shown in Fig 6a.\n", "title": "Reply to Reviewer 3"}, "S1eolmNX6m": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SklxtSc93Q", "comment": "Thank you for your review and we would be delighted to address your concerns, but do require some clarifications.\n\nWhile a learnable lambda could be considered we would argue that the learning of this parameter beyond the grid-search applied in the submission is somewhat tangential to our primary contribution: a unified framework which lends itself to targeted representation analysis and modification. \n\n1)\nThe notion of a map of \\lambdas sounds interesting. However, at present, it is not clear to us what this refers to as \\lambda is a weighting on a loss term. Clarification would be much appreciated so we can fully engage with this point. As far as the existing approach is concerned, Figure 6 illustrates the influence of \\lambda on the accuracy and correlation of global and local stability prediction.\n\n2)\nThe inconsistent correlations between the two tasks are exactly the scenarios where stethoscopes come into their own: testing positive and negative regimes of lambda (corresponding to auxiliary and adversarial training, respectively) reveals the interplay between the two tasks and potentially allows for de-biasing the algorithm as shown in Figure 6a. Therefore, in contrast to the design not considering these relationships, it explicitly addresses them.\n\nCould you please elaborate on the comment \u2019the current design [\u2026] simply sums them up\u2019? The stethoscope module has its own trainable parameters and a separate loss function.

We believe it captures the essence of what we are proposing and are delighted with the overall very positive assessment. As regards the weakness mentioned, we accept the characterisation of our work as incremental in the sense that it draws together a number of known techniques from areas such as multi-task and adversarial learning. We argue, however, that the contribution of our submission lies exactly in the unification of these approaches into the stethoscope framework, which lends itself to targeted representation analysis and modification.

Specifically, the paper creates a new extension to the dataset, and it proposes the use of \"Neural Stethoscopes\" framework to analyze deep neural nets' physical reasoning of local stability v.s. global stability.

Specifically on the task of stability prediction, it is quite interesting to know that neural nets can be misled by visual cues (local stability).\n\nHowever, my concern is that the paper focuses only on a very specific application domain,  and an improvement over the niche dataset with much more supervision (from the extension) is not surprising at all.

Instead of just one scalar value, it could be better to learn a map of \\lambdas, which indicates the distribution of local stability and how it is related to global stability. The visualization of the \\lambda map might be more interpretable for understanding the stability prediction. \n\n2) The global stability prediction does not have a consistent correlation with the local stability prediction, as shown by the easy and hard examples. This complex relationship will confuse the network during the training. That is, the current design hasn't well considered the local and global stability relation, but just simply sum them up.

The idea is incremental to multi-task learning and enable, in a single framework, to validate intermediate features for additional related tasks. Moreover it can promote or suppress the correlation of such features to the tasks related to the main one. The framework is applied to the task of visual stability prediction of block towers. The paper builds upon Groth et al. 2018, adding the concept of local stability as correlated secondary task, used with the proposed neural stethoscopes. Experiments with an extension of ShapeStacks (Groth et al. 2018) dataset where the local stability is added to the global stability class, show that it is possibile increase the performance using the additional task. Moreover, it is shown that neural stethoscopes can suppress nuisance information when using a biased training dataset where the local and global stability are purposely inversely correlated.\n\nStrengths:\n+ A very nice paper, well written and easy to read. Figures are helpful and the structure is clear.\n+ The concept of neural stethoscope is interesting and simplify the concepts behind multitask learning.\n+ Experiments are convincing, interesting and there is some novelty in vision stability prediction.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The novelty is limited related to multitask learning, thus it is an incremental paper.\n", "title": "nice solid paper", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}}}
