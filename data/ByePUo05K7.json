Contrary to the reviewer's belief that \"no one in the ML or CNS community speculates that CNNs and human cognition use similar mechanisms\", this is an active area of research with studies finding evidence both of similarities and systematic differences between the two. Please see below for a (non-exhaustive) list of studies published, in recent years, in high-impact journals, in computational neuroscience, psychology and machine learning that compare human cognition/vision/neuroscience and CNNs.\n\nR2.  The reviewer claims that our use of the term CNN lacks nuance.  It is true that we haven't tested all possible CNN architectures, training sets, loss functions and optimization algorithms. It would be unfeasible to do this. However, we have selected some representative architectures and training sets carefully. We chose to test VGG-16 (and ResNet-101) because these architectures are known to perform at a comparable level to human object categorisation and have been frequently used for making comparison to biological vision (see references below). We chose ImageNet (for pre-training) and CIFAR-10 (for the pixel task) for similar reasons. Moreover, as far as we can test, our results generalise to a host of different architectures (we tested a four-layered CNN, VGG-11, VGG-16, Resnet-101), a variety of different optimisation algorithms (SGD, RMSProp, Adam) and a variety of different training regimes (ImageNet, CIFAR-10 or trained from scratch on the modified dataset). It is, of course, possible that we are incorrect in assuming that our results generalise. That is why we have made it clear in the manuscript exactly how we trained and tested the models and invite future research showing if there are conditions under which CNNs can show shape bias.\n\nRelated to this, the reviewer also writes: \u201cA reasonable expectation is that a large capacity network with a large diverse training data trained on a large set of diverse and representative training tasks should induce an inductive shape bias.\u201d Can the reviewer point us to any data underlying his belief that a large enough network with a large training set induce shape bias?\n \nR2(a). The reviewer writes: \u201cThe authors agree that the experiments don't show whether CNNs encode shape bias or not.\u201d\n\nNo - we don't. We agreed that CNNs may be capable of encoding shape. This is not the same as having a shape *bias*. As far as we can see, there is no preference for shape compared to other features, hence no shape bias.\n \nR2(b) The reviewer's statement that \"categorization CNNs do not learn to represent shapes well is hardly a surprise\" goes against previously published work that suggests that CNNs perform categorization based on shape (e.g., Kubilius et al, 2016). This has led to the expectation that CNNs capture essential mechanisms underlying human vision. For example, Kriegeskorte & Douglas (2018) argue that \"internal representations of deep convolutional neural networks provide the best current models of representations of visual images in inferior temporal cortex in humans and monkeys\". Given these comparisons being made between CNNs and biological vision makes our results both interesting and important.\n \nR2(b-1).  The reviewer writes that the shape bias claim \u201c\u2026 is weakly demonstrated by the paper\u201d because \u201cpretrained (frozen) convolution layers are more robust to appearance perturbations introduced in the data\u201d as shown in Figure 9.\n\nIt is not surprising size of the effect reduces (though it's still significant) when there is no learning in convolution layers.  In this case they retain their previous representations and don't rely entirely on the single pixel or noise mask. The reviewer complains that we still allowed learning in the fully connected layers. If we froze the learning in fully connected layers, then learning will be frozen in the *entire* network. How could we then train it on a fresh set of images?\n\nR2(b-2).  The reviewer points that humans and CNNs learn under very different conditions.  It is true that humans and CNNs undergo very different training conditions. Nevertheless, there is evidence (and we have cited it in the manuscript) that humans show such a shape-bias from a very early age, suggesting that it is not an artefact of the training environment. Furthermore, in order to see whether training makes a difference, we have designed a set of different studies to gauge whether pre-training on a different dataset makes a difference (it does not), learning simultaneously on a set of categories without a diagnostic pixel makes a difference (it does not), learning beforehand on CIFAR-10 makes a difference (it does not), whether a variation in the diagnostic noise makes a difference (it makes very limited difference). Still there may be training conditions that could be responsible for shape-bias and we invite future research to point this out.", "title": "Detailed responses"}, "H1x1wzf2AQ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJlK-uJFRm", "comment": "In the first round of reviews, the reviewer raised two main criticisms that were both incorrect.

The reviewer seems to be rejecting our paper on the basis that it is not interesting to compare CNNs with human vision, in spite of the fact that ICLR explicitly invites research on deep learning methods applied to neuroscience and computational biology, and in spite of the fact that vision is the domain of cognition that is most frequently modelled using neural networks.\n\nIn the first round, the reviewer was sufficiently surprised by our results that he/she attempted to replicate our findings and reported that they did not replicate.  In response, we not only showed that our results replicate, but also showed that the same findings are obtained using a different architecture, ResNet-101.  In the second round, the reviewer finds our demonstration of the lack of shape bias unsurprising, claiming there is no reason to expect CNN to relate to human vision. We admit to finding this new major criticism to be frustrating because it is factually incorrect.

And, it seems to satisfactorily demonstrate this. It shows that such features could be single pixels, noise masks and even parameters of stochastic distributions which randomly produce these features, as long as the parameters are predictive of the image category. The experiments are well designed and they demonstrate this point quite well. They also demonstrate the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting.\n\nNonetheless, there are significant drawbacks in the presented work:\n\n1.\tThe experiments don't seem to effectively demonstrate the main claim of the paper that categorization CNNs do not have inductive shape bias (encode shape information). (Let\u2019s make this claim more concrete: categorization CNNs when trained via supervised learning with paired training data of {(image, category_label)} do not have inductive shape bias.)\n\nThe best way to demonstrate this would have been to subject a trained image-categorization CNN to test data with object shapes in a way that the appearance information couldn\u2019t be used to predict the object label.

None of the experiments logically imply that with an unaltered training regime, a trained network would not be predictive of the category label if shapes corresponding to that category are presented. \n\n2.\tDue to the surprising results (especially the intensity of observed effects), we tried to reproduce some results from the paper in our lab and faced difficulties in doing so:\n\na.\tWe tried to replicate Figure 4(a) 'nopix' and 'same' cases on a standard setting (VGG-12-BN on CIFAR-10). The results deviated significantly (33%-72% margin) on \u2018nopix\u2019 case from the results reported in the paper on a much stronger setting (1/3072 pixels vs 1/50176 as in the paper). Please let me know any crucial settings (see below) that we might have missed.\n\nDetails: We used the vgg-cifar10 repository by chengyangfu. The only additions was fixing the pixel values while sending in the data. The code is anonymized and hosted here: https://file.io/qiziAK. The pixel values in CIFAR-10 using the pytorch dataloader are between [-0.45, 0.45] theoretically, typically much smaller. We set the (0,0) RGB pixels categorically spacing it uniformly from [-0.25, 0.25), [-0.025, 0.025), [-0.0025, 0.0025) as a simple experiment. The third case did not suffer any decrease in the nopix case or any increase in the pix at all. The first case showed significant deviations from the claimed results with the no-pix resulting in ~43% accuracy which is 33% off vis-\u00e0-vis the results in the paper.

We agree with the reviewer that the results may not be ground-breaking as a demonstration of the limitations of CNNs, but as the reviewer correctly identifies, the key novelty of our work lies in contrasting how shape is treated very differently by humans and CNNs. In this sense, our study is more constructive than a typical adversarial attack, as it points in a direction where deep learning research could benefit from understanding the representations and processes underlying human vision. (Please see the revised Introduction, which highlights this contrast). \n\nAnother contrast with adversarial studies (such as single pixel attacks) is that we manually insert non-shape features in the training set, rather than exploring susceptibilities of CNNs trained on well-known datasets. By creating these biases in the dataset, we were able to understand how such biases affect performance and the surprising extent to which non-shape features can drive performance (even in cases when such non-shape features would be nearly imperceptible to a human being). Also, our study is the first to systematically manipulate the conditions in which non-shape information impacted performance: We varied the type of non-shape noise, we varied the timing at which the noise was introduced (and found that the non-shape information overwrote shape information through catastrophic interference), manipulated the percentage of images in which the noise was embedded, and varied the form of regularization in order to see whether the effects are related to overfitting (we found no effect).  This is a very different approach than past papers that search for adversarial images, but our findings may help explain why some adversarial images are effective. \n\nWe completely agree that it is an important question about how to make CNNs focus more on shape (that is, how to induce a shape bias in CNNs).

In fact, this is not our claim. We agree that, given the right dataset, CNNs may indeed encode shape information. The reviewer is right in saying that our study does not demonstrate that CNNs do not encode shape information when trained on well-known datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. If we wanted to test this, the experiment suggested by the reviewer would indeed make sense. However, our intention was to test a different hypothesis: that shape has a privileged status amongst features used to perform recognition. It is this privileged status of shape that is frequently referred to as \"shape-bias\" in psychological literature. There is a lot of evidence from psychological experiments showing that humans show a preference for using shape over other features such as size, colour or texture when any of these features are diagnostic of an object\u2019s category. (We have added examples of these studies to the revised manuscript). We suspected that CNNs do not have such a shape bias, and in order to test how far this lack of shape bias could be pushed, we created a dataset where, in addition to shape, an almost imperceptible feature (a single pixel / an additive noise mask) was also diagnostic of an image\u2019s category. Our experiments show that even for these nearly imperceptible features, the model did not show any preference for using shape. While this does not mean that CNNs do not use shape when trained on any given dataset, they do show that they tend to pick on whatever feature is more predictive, a behaviour that contrasts with human cognition. \n \nGiven the reviewer\u2019s comment, we can see that this aspect of the paper was not clearly laid out. Therefore, we have revised the manuscript, clarifying our claim and laying out the psychological literature that motivated our study at the outset. ", "title": "Response to review: Claim"}, "Byeoli4gCQ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1ebFhuRnQ", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for some really useful feedback and especially the effort put in to replicating our study. We are pleased that this reviewer found our findings sufficiently surprising that he/she ran a replication study based on Figure 4(a) and provided us a link to determine exactly what was done.  We were of course concerned to hear that our findings did not replicate.  However, it turns out that this is due to the way in which the dataset has been generated. When generated in the correct manner, our results indeed replicate using the code provided by the reviewer. The other major concern the reviewer had was whether our experiments correctly examine our main claim. We address both these concerns in detail below. \n \n[Replication] There are two crucial differences between our code and the reviewer\u2019s in the way the pixel was inserted into any image. Firstly, we inserted the pixel at a different (x,y) location for each category. This made the pixel location diagnostic of the category of each image. In contrast, the reviewer inserted the pixel at the same location (0,0) for all categories, making the location of the pixel non-diagnostic. Secondly, the reviewer assumes that the pixel values in CIFAR-10 using the pytorch dataloader are between [-0.45, 0.45]. This is not the case in the code provided by the reviewer. Due to normalisation, these values are, in fact, approximately between [-2.5, 2.5]. Therefore, pixel values used by the reviewer to test the results ([-0.25, 0.25] / [-0.025, 0.025] / [-0.0025, 0.0025]) provide a very weak diagnostic signal to the network. \n \nTo check whether these settings make a difference, we modified the code provided by the reviewer in two ways: (i) we picked the (x,y) location of the pixel for each category randomly from a uniform distribution [0, 32) (but kept it constant for all images within a category), and (ii) we picked each of the RGB values for the inserted pixel from a uniform distribution in the range [-2.0, 2.0), [-1.0, 1.0) or [-0.01, 0.01). Other than these changes the code provided by the reviewer remains the same (only changes are around lines 60-70 and then 175-180). When the pixel values were in the interval [-2.0, 2.0), the accuracy is ~100% in the Same condition and between 10-20% in the NoPix condition, which is very close to what we find. The small remaining difference could be due to a difference in learning algorithm used (we used RMSProp while the reviewer used SGD) or due to pretraining (we used a VGG-16 network pretrained on ImageNet while the reviewer used a VGG-11 network that was trained from scratch on the modified dataset). When pixel values are in the range [-1.0, 1.0) we again get an accuracy of ~100% in the Same condition, which drops to ~20% in the NoPix condition. Even when the inserted pixel provides a very weak diagnostic signal, with pixel values nearly at the mean [-0.01, 0.01), the network shows a large drop in performance from ~100% in the Same condition to ~50% in the NoPix condition, clearly demonstrating the reliance on this diagnostic pixel. Furthermore, it should also be noted that even under the conditions used by the reviewer, where all the categories had the pixel inserted at the same location and pixel values were grayscale and in the small range [-0.25, 0.25), performance dropped from 98% to 42% when the pixel was removed. It is inconceivable that this will happen for human participants and provides additional support for our observation that the model simply picks up whatever statistical structure is most relevant to learning the training set, with shape playing no special role.  \n \nWe have uploaded the modified code and log files here: http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=24861367338244091333. However, we do understand that some of these settings may not have been completely obvious in the previous version of the manuscript. To facilitate future replication, we have moved the description of some of these settings from the Appendix to the main text. Furthermore, in order to check if the results replicated on other networks, we have now run the key simulation using ResNet-101 and found that we get a similar pattern of results. We have updated the key figures (Figure 2 & Figure 6) to show these results.", "title": "Response to review: Replication"}, "S1gzNLVxRm": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1xUCxgEpm", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for taking time to read the paper and for their feedback. The reviewer\u2019s key concern was that he/she did not find our results sufficiently novel or surprising as it is already well established that bias in datasets can lead to incorrect generalisation, as shown by Torralba & Efros (2011). \n \nWe agree that we are not the first to make this point.  Our contribution is to highlight the surprising extent to which non-shape features can drive performance, and indeed, even the slightest bias (even a single pixel) is enough for CNNs to ignore shape and rely on the diagnostic signal.  Also, unlike previous studies, we systematically manipulated the conditions in which non-shape information impacted performance:  We varied the type of non-shape noise, we varied the timing at which the noise was introduced (and found that the non-shape information overwrote shape information through catastrophic interference), manipulated the percentage of images in which the noise was embedded, and varied the form of regularization in order to see whether the effects are related to overfitting (we found no effect).   Most importantly, we manipulated the degree to which the noise biased the training set (e.g., we manipulate the fraction of images containing the noise mask and the variability in the mask from one image to another), and showed that CNNs are strongly impacted across all levels of noise (and types of noise).  This is important given that all image datasets undoubtedly included uncontrolled noise that is correlated with the output categories (as pointed by Torralba & Efros).  Our findings highlight that this may have a larger impact on performance than previously assumed (and indeed, may help explain how single-pixel attacks can be successful).  \n \nFurthermore, our findings with CNNs contrast with human visual perception where the extraction of shape occurs quickly and automatically and shape holds a privileged status compared to other diagnostic features, such as size, colour or texture. These features may allow humans to overcome biases present in their own environments. As Torralba & Efros point out: \u201ca human learns about vision by living in a reduced environment with many potential local biases and yet the visual system is robust enough to overcome this.\u201d Being biased towards finding shape may be a way in which the visual system overcomes one type of dataset biases (ones due to non-shape features present within the environment), and our results show that this shape-bias is missing from CNNs. \n \nWe disagree with Reviewer 1 that our findings are due to overfitting.  Rather than overfitting, we have shown that CNNs are happy to fit to non-shape data. This is why regularisation methods such as weight-decay, batch normalisation and dropout have no impact on the results (Figure 3). \n \nIn light of the reviewer\u2019s comments, we have revised the Introduction and Discussion to make these issues clear.

We have uploaded a revision in response to these points.  Here we respond to the most important concern shared by the reviewers, and then respond to the more specific comments under each review. \n\nThe main concern is that we have altered the CIFAR images by introducing noise strongly correlated with the output categories. Accordingly, we have only shown that CNNs rely on non-shape cues under (unusual) conditions in which non-shape information is highly diagnostic of the categories. On this view, there is no reason to assume that CNNs trained on unperturbed images will rely on non-shape information, and thus no reason to conclude that CNNs ignore shape, nor claim that CNNs fail to show a shape bias. \n\nThis concern reflects a misunderstanding.  When we conclude that CNNs do not have a shape bias we do not mean to imply that CNNs ignore shape.  Rather, we are claiming that CNNs do not have an inbuilt inductive bias to rely on shape and that they will use any sort of statistical regularities that can be exploited (shape or non-shape).  In our simulations we made non-shape features more diagnostic than shape, and accordingly, the CNNs used non-shape.   By contrast, there is a large literature in psychology that shows that humans do have an inductive bias to rely on shape when identifying objects, and accordingly, psychological theory predicts that humans would continue to rely heavily on shape even when non-shape features are more diagnostic of object category.  We are making a psychological claim that CNNs are importantly different than humans rather than claiming that CNNs ignore shape in general. \n\nLooking over the paper again we see that we were not very clear on this point.  Our revision now includes a modified introduction with a more detailed discussion of the shape bias in human object recognition.  We now emphasize that our main question is whether CNNs have a preference to categorize images according to shape (a shape bias, consistent with psychological theory), or whether CNNs are equally happy to rely on non-shape information for the sake of object identification (and use whatever is more diagnostic in a given dataset).  We think this is an interesting question given that CNNs were inspired by the visual cortex and given that some researchers claim that CNNs capture important properties of human vision (e.g., Rajalingham et al., 2018). In order to accommodate all of these changes and still stay within the page-limit, we have moved one of the experiments that was not central to the main story to Appendix C.  \n\nRajalingham, R., Issa, E.

Shape prior information helps human object recognition ability to generalize well to different scenarios. This paper aims to highlight the fact that CNNs will not necessarily learn to recognize objects based on their shape. Authors modified training images by changing a value of a pixel where its location is correlated with object category or by adding noise-like (additive or Salt-and-pepper) masks to training images. Parameters of such noise-like masks are correlated with object category. In other words if one learns noise parameters or location of altered pixel for each object category, they can categorize all images in the training set. This paper shows that CNNs will overfeat to these noise based features and fail to correctly classify images at test time when these noise based features are changed or not added to the test images.  \n\nDataset bias is a very important factor in designing a dataset (Torralba et al,. 2011). Consider the case where we have a dataset of birds and cats. The task is image classification. All birds' images have the same background which is different than cats' background. As a result the network that is trained on these images will learn to categorize training images based on their background. Because extracting object based features such as shape of a bird and bird's texture is more difficult than extracting background features which is the same for all training images. \n\nAuthors have carefully designed a set of experiments which shows CNNs will overfeat to non-shape features that they added to training images. However, this outcome is not surprising. Similar to dataset design example, if you add a noise pattern correlated with object categories to training images, you are adding a significant bias to your dataset. As a result networks that are trained on this dataset will overfeat to these noise patterns. Because it is easier to extract these noise parameters  than to extract object based features which are different for each image due to different viewpoints or illumination and so on. \n\nThis paper would have been a stronger paper if authors had suggested mechanisms or solutions which could have reduced dataset bias or geared CNNs towards extracting shape like features.  \n\nAntonio Torralba and Alexei A.

More specifically, the authors create shapeless object features (by adding noise masks in various forms or single pixels that are predictive of categorization to object images) to study how much CNNs rely on shape information (as humans would) as opposed to shapeless arbitrary statistical dependencies between pixels. \n\nThe hypotheses tested are straightforward and the experiments cleverly answer these questions. On the negative side, there is nothing groundbreaking in this study. As acknowledged by the authors, the results are not all that novel in light of recent work that has already shown that one could conduct adversarial attacks by corrupting a single pixel as well as work that has shown that CNNs do not generalize to noise degradations they have not seen. Still, there is value in the work presented as the empirical tests described address the role of shape in object recognition with CNNs.\n\nIn a sense, the present study offers a null result and obviously, the work would have been much more significant had the authors offered a mechanism to get CNNs to learn to prioritize \"shape\" features (then verifying that such network would work on CIFAR, but performed poorly on the shapeless images).\n\nAdditional analysis involving visualization methods to further explain why shape features were ignored would have been a plus\u2013 with bonus points for providing a heuristic to determine the \"shapelessness\" of a convolution kernel.", "title": "clever experiments with interesting implications", "rating": "7: Good paper, accept", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}}}
