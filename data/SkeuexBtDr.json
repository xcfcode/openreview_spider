We propose a rule-exemplar method for collecting human supervision to combine the efficiency of rules with the quality of instance labels. The supervision is coupled such that it is both natural for humans and synergistic for learning. We propose a training algorithm that jointly denoises rules via latent coverage variables, and trains the model through a soft implication loss over the coverage and label variables. The denoised rules and trained model are used jointly for inference. Empirical evaluation on five different tasks shows that (1) our algorithm is more accurate than several existing methods of learning from a mix of clean and noisy supervision, and (2) the coupled rule-exemplar supervision is effective in denoising rules.", "keywords": ["Learning from Rules", "Learning from limited labeled data", "Weakly Supervised Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Spotlight)", "comment": "The paper addresses the problem of costly human supervision for training supervised learning methods.\nThe authors propose a joint approach for more effectively collecting supervision data from humans, by extracting rules and their exemplars, and a model for training on this data.\nThey demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on multiple datasets by comparing to a range of baselines.\n\nBased on the reviews and my own reading I recommend to accept this paper.\nThe approach makes intuitively a lot of sense and is well explained.\nThe experimental results are convincing.

This paper proposes a better rule-based labeling method by restricting the coverage of the rule, which is based on the assumption that the rules can be applied to a local region but can not be 'over-generalized' to the whole sample space.

A rule in this scenario will be a partial policy, i.e., it will map some states to an action but may not cover other states. During training, the state space could either be sampled completely randomly or by following the policy formed by applying the current rule weights to each rule, or a combination.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #2"}, "ByxNcIqtsB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Bkxefw05KS", "comment": "Thank you for providing valuable feedback on our work.

A more principled and integrated framework like EM could be more convincing to me.\n \nOur first attempt was indeed a principled EM framework which we called the Posterior regularization (PR) method that we derive in detail in the Supplementary.  Unfortunately, we found that this EM formulation performed worse than the only-L baseline in two of the five datasets (Table 2). That is what led us to our current non-EM formulation which provided higher accuracy while being (frustratingly :) simpler.  Also, it was more robust to hyper-parameter selection and initializations than the EM formulation. Finally, if you compare our ImplyLoss objective (Eq 5) with  EM\u2019s objective (Eq 14), the two labeled loss terms are identical.  The only difference is in the term involving unlabeled data.  In EM,  the KL term biases the model to match the estimated distribution by the teacher which is changing and could be incorrect.  In contrast, the ImplyLoss does not introduce any such bias as we discuss in Section 2.1 (below Table 1). \n\n> Second, it seems the unlabelled data is only used in the causal constraint term (the last term in Eqn 5) and it is controlled by a coefficient \\gamma. It is a bit unclear to me whether the unlabelled data is fully utilized while it only constraints the causal relation, as one can also use labeled data for constraining the causal relation. \n\nYes, unlabelled data is only used in the last term of Eqn 5. This term allows full utilization of the correctly generalized unlabelled data as follows: When P(r_j =1|x_i) is close to one, the causal term reduces to log-likelihood of labeling x_i as l_j, allowing us to treat x_i as a labeled instance. The same causal term allows us to ignore wrongly generalized instances as follows:  when P(r_j =1|x_i) is close to zero, the gradient on the label parameters (\\theta) is vanishingly small.\n \n> Also, why not include labeled data for this constraint regularization?\n\nEmpirically, we found no difference between including labeled data in the causal term or not.\nThe causal term when fitted with the clean labels for \u2018y_i\u2019 and r_{ji} (when available) reduce to the likelihood term LL(\\theta). We did not want to double count labeled instances and distort the training distribution.   \n\n> Another minor question is after the two networks are trained, will you only use the learned classifier for test data, or, do you also use the conditional distribution in the testing phase and compute an expectation of the predicted class? and why?\n\nWe only use the classification network (parametrized by \\theta) for test data. The conditional distribution is only applicable when a rule covers the instance. However, an example in the test set may not be covered by any of the rules (For one of our datasets coverage of rules is only 14% ).  We also tried to predict the 'y' that minimizes a joint score over y and r_ji conditionals. But in practice we did not see much difference.\n\n> Also, what's the purpose of section 6 in the appendix?\n\nSection 6 describes our attempt of an EM-based framework (Algorithm 1, Pg. 13) for this task. We compare implication loss with this alternative approach of jointly learning the classifier and rule network by imposing the same causal constraints in a different way.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer #1 "}, "Byg7vz-pFr": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkeuexBtDr", "review": "This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from both clean instance-level labels and noisy rule-level labels, and also a simple but effective algorithm as solution.

Empirically the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with consistent improvements over several baselines on a wide range of classification tasks.\n\nThe idea of using macro-level noisy labels as part of the supervision is novel, and it could potentially trigger a paradigm shift on many research areas in machine learning.

It deals with classification problems, and proposes a method to obtain more (but weaker) labels data with minimal involvement from human labellers, by asking them to generalize their labelling decisions into rules and then learning restrictions on those rules to avoid learning incorrectly generalized labels. The motivating observation is that human labellers are often able to make such generalizations in much less time than it would take them to apply that rule to a large dataset themselves. This is an interesting idea, especially for cases where labelling capacity is limited. The point being made about the labelling noise not being random in this situation is an interesting one - it might be worth exploring this notion further on its own also in contexts where the source of the noise is unknown.\n\nThe presentation of the implementation the authors choose for their proposed approach is clear, and the implementation is sensible. The experimental section includes comparisons to a number of alternative methods, and the authors find that their method outperforms all others, including recent methods for combining (noisy) rule-based labels and (clean) human-sourced labels.\n\nI would argue for accepting this paper. It studies an interesting question, which if answered has the potential to make access to machine learning solutions to certain types of problem significantly cheaper and therefore more widespread.
