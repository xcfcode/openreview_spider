Some architectures incorporate methods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve memory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence, this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated LSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow. This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values. Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the convergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.", "keywords": ["time gate", "faster convergence", "trainability", "rnn", "computational budget"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "perhaps the biggest issue with the proposed approach is that the proposed approach, which supposedly addresses the issue of capturing long-term dependency with a faster convergence, was only tested on problems with largely fixed length. with the proposed k_n gate being defined as a gaussian with a single mean (per unit?) and variance, it is important and interesting to know how this network would cope with examples of vastly varying lengths. in addition, r3 made good points about comparison against conventional LSTM and how it should be done with careful hyperparameter tuning and based on conventional known setups. \n\nthis submission will be greatly strengthened with more experiments using a better set of benchmarks and by more carefully placing its contribution w.r.t. other recent advances."}, "review": {"HkgsK11j1E": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "r1eO_oCqtQ", "comment": "We appreciate the knowledgeable and insightful comments regarding convergence.

Regarding the baseline LSTM, we have taken care of optimizing hyperparameters and initializations. This is reflected in the performance of the baseline LSTM networks, which are on par with the performance of LSTM networks with similar network size in other publications, e.g. Recurrent Batch Normalization by Cooijmans et al.  We have also used biased gate initializations, which we have now added to the paragraph in Section 3.4.\n\n4.

It is possible that the PLSTM will outperform the g-LSTM on tasks which require a periodicity, but we have not found any datasets as yet where the PLSTM outperforms the g-LSTM. Moreover the time gate parameters in the g-LSTM network need not be carefully initialized, which is not true in the case of PLSTM.\n\n2. The intention of Table 2 is not to do a direct comparison of our two networks against other reported networks on the sMNIST, pMNIST, and sCIFAR-10 datasets. We reported the other networks in this table because we wanted to show the accuracies that are achievable on these datasets by using other methods. There are several reasons why we cannot do a direct comparison: the IndRNN network is a multi-layered architecture and we could not reproduce the results in the BN-LSTM work even though we used the reported training parameters.  We do not claim that the g-LSTM network can produce state-of-the-art results, rather we see it as an alternate model that helps long sequence training and could probably be used in addition to other methods such as the auxiliary loss in the r-LSTM work and IndRNN.", "title": "Response to AnonReviewer2"}, "HkxYmJqo2m": {"type": "review", "replyto": "r1eO_oCqtQ", "review": "In the vein of recent work on learning \u201cticking\u201d behaviour for LSTMs such as Phased LSTM, this paper proposes to add additional data independent gates to LSTM units that are defined as Gaussian functions of time indices.\nThe performance of the modified g-LSTM is compared to LSTM on the Addition, sequential MNIST and sequential CIFAR-10 tasks. The authors argue that g-LSTM results in better performance and has faster convergence on these tasks. \n\nAdditionally, it is proposed that one can reduce the amount of computations performed by the network by adding a computation budget term to the optimized loss that encouraged the cells to update less often. Finally, a technique for gradually transitioning from a g-LSTM to an LSTM during training is proposed, with the objective of speeding up training over a regular LSTM.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand in general. However, the main results of this paper are experimental, and I am not entirely convinced by the experiments that g-LSTM is an improvement over the LSTM baseline for certain scenarios.\n\nOne broad reason for my doubts is that the comparisons don\u2019t seem to utilise proper hyperparameter tuning for the baseline LSTM. Network sizes, learning rates, decay schedules, initialisations etc. all appear to be fixed, so one can not be sure of the \u201creal\u201d performance or convergence behavior of the models. Biased gate initializations are not used, though they have been used successfully in past work to aid in long term memory.\n\nI should note that for long term memory problems such as those proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), the proposed LSTM did not use a forget gate (or even BPTT) and used biased gate initialisations. However, these features are useful for more realistic tasks, and popular LSTM designs are biased towards them instead of toy problems.\n\nI would consider the addition problem and sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 to be interesting and difficult toy tasks for initial validation of ideas (and more extensive hyperparameter searches). It is unclear if the proposed techniques will perform provide  improvements over a well-tuned baseline for some realistic tasks, or are they suitable only for toy problems.

With this additional gate, the network can skip updating the states by closing the time-gate, as a result enabling longer memory persistence, and better gradient flow. The authors also propose to add a budget term to force the time-gate to be closed most of the time as a way to save compute. Empirical results suggest the Gaussian-gated LSTMs perform better than regular LSTMs on tasks with long temporal dependencies. The authors also propose to use a curriculum training schedule in which the variance of the gaussian gates is continuously increased to speed up training of LSTMS.  \n\npros:\n1. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow;\n2. The way the authors introduce time-dependent gating into LSTM is easy to follow and re-implement;\n3. Experiments on various tasks of long temporal dependencies do show improvement over the standard LSTM cells;\n4. The experiments on the adding task does show gLSTM is less sensitive to initialization than the phased LSTM;\n5. The experiments on setting curriculum training schedule to improve convergence on LSTMs are insightful. \n\ncons:\n1. The work was framed as an easier-to-optimize alternative to the time-based gating mechanism introduced in phased LSTMs, which takes a parametrization form that is much harder to learn, the gating mechanism covered by the new model gLSTM however, is much more limited. The parametrization introduced in Phased LSTMs allows the memory cells and outputs of LSTMs to be updated periodically. gLSTMs on the other hand only allows updates within a single window over the entire sequence; As a result, one would expect phased LSTM to outperform gLSTM on tasks with periodical temporal dependencies;  \n2.  The empirical results are not convincing enough. gLSTM performs noticeably worse than several state-of-the-art work on improving long-term dependencies in RNNs.
