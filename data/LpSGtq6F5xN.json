While I believe that this paper can be turned into a good ICLR paper, it doesn\u2019t meet the standard of ICLR in its current form.\n\nMore specifically:\n1) The quality of the writeup is poor, containing many typos but more problematically many unclear/confusing statements which are either vague/unclear, not supported by citations and/or substantiated in other parts of the paper (Examples: \u201eThis might result in inferior clustering performance, degenerated generative model, and stability issues during training.\u201c Or \u201cHowever, this objective seems to miss the clustering target, since the reconstruction term of is not related to the clustering and actual clustering is only associated with the regularization term optimization.\u201c). An important contribution of the paper could be to substantiate these statements and I argue that achieving better performance alone is not sufficient therefore.\n\n2) From a theoretical perspective, it would be interesting whether there is any justification for statements like the ones references above. Furthermore, the authors\u2019 approach involves several approximations whose implications are neither studied nor explained. The authors responded only partially to questions in that regard by reviewers leaving certain concerns unanswered. \n\n3) From an empirical perspective, an extended study of the proposed approach would help t better understand its benefits over existing approaches. Commonly considered settings like mismatch in the number of specified clusters are not studied at all. The proposed approach also seems to be initialized by VaDe (mentioned in Section 4) and it would be interesting to understand to which extend this is necessary and why (and how does performance change/degrade if this is not done). It also makes statements regarding stability unclear as training VaDe itself can be quite challenging. Furthermore, the overall algorithm for training the proposed model should be presented in a compact form in the paper. The paper should also be self-contained in the sense of containing information on the important hyper-parameters needed for training the proposed model.\n\nIn summary, the proposed approach is potentially interesting but the paper should not be accepted in its current form.\n"}, "review": {"T-D076YJk0": {"type": "review", "replyto": "LpSGtq6F5xN", "review": "The authors propose to cluster a data-set into k groups using k-VAE.\nThe model is at the intersection of k-DAE (Opochinsky et al., 2020), and VaDE (Jiang et al., 2016).\n\nThe paper is straightforward and goes directly to the point: VAEs improve AEs.\nThe reason is however not discussed.\n\nSome sentences are a bit clumsy, eg.:\n\"Our k(DVAE improves upon the current state-of-the-art clustering methods in several facets: (1) A novel model ...(2) A novel, \"\nNovelty is not per se an improvement.

However, some analysis are missing. For example, at first sight having k AE to  train seems a bulky situation. However the authors claim that the SoA performances can be reached with smaller architecture. How does this evolves with k? I other the words, what are the limit of VaDE and k-DVAE.\nOverall, the contributions are incremental and mildly novel.\n\n---\n\nIndeed, the GMVAE was already omitted in DGG's paper.\nRegarding section 4.3, I meant that you don't need to recall the definition of ACC. \n", "title": "Extending k-DAE with VAE", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "TPtLdLIeoB6": {"type": "review", "replyto": "LpSGtq6F5xN", "review": "1) Quality of the writing.\n\nThe paper is rather difficult to read because of many typos and confusing statements. The authors should spend more time in refining the clarity of the presentation. Some suggestions: run a spell checker, avoid sloppy statements, be more meticulous in the description of related works and improve Figure 1.\nTo give some examples, here are two sentences from the Introduction:\n\n\u201cAs a result, the respective methods have provided new opportunities for clustering. These methods incorporate the ability to learn a (non-linear) mapping of the raw features in a low-dimensional vector space ...\u201d. Here I struggle to understand which are the respective methods and which are these methods. The only models described before are the K-means and the Gaussian Mixture Model. They surely do not incorporate the ability to learn a mapping of the raw features into a latent representation.\n\n\u201cHowever, this objective seems to miss the clustering target, since the reconstruction term of is not related to the clustering and actual clustering is only associated with the regularization term optimization.\u201d  Besides some typos, this seems a rather strong statement as VaDE and GMMVAE indeed are quite good at clustering and the fact that the clustering objective is enforced by the prior distribution in the latent space does not result in \u201cmissing the clustering target\u201d. A reference or a more systematic description could help.\n\n\n2) Hard clustering and K-DAE.\nThe title and the first chapters (till Chapter 3.2) are unfortunately quite misleading. The authors state that they propose a novel Variational Bayesian framework with K encoder-decoder architecture and they derive the corresponding ELBO in Chapter 3.2. However, they then choose to retain a deterministic approach. The latter is nothing else than a mixture of K Autoencoders with an L2 regularisation in the latent space. Hence, the proposed approach does not differ much from the k-DAE approach and I believe it cannot be described as a \u201cnovel Variational Bayesian framework\".\n\n3) Latent space.\nOne of the advantages of the VaDE method is that the latent space is nicely clustered following a Mixture of Gaussians distribution. The proposed method, on the other hand, chooses a unit normal distribution instead. As a result, the latent space cannot be used to visually investigate the data and there is no principled method to measure the uncertainty of the clustering prediction.\n\n3) Comparison with related work.\nThis paper reminded me of [1] which seems quite similar. I would find the paper more persuasive if it stated what the authors do over and above.\n[1] Kopf, A. et al. \u201cMixture-of-Experts Variational Autoencoder for clustering and generating from similarity-based representations.\u201d ArXiv abs/1910.07763 (2019): n. pag.\n", "title": "The authors propose a variant of variational deep clustering to include K encoder-decoder neural architectures to improve the quality of the data generations and the clustering performance.

This is NOT what we are doing. This actually appears as one of the baselines that we compared to - k-DAE. The whole point of the paper is showing that this is not the preferred way for deep clustering. \n\nWe follow here the VAE paradigm. We have a generative model, and we use an amortized variational approximation for the posterior distribution implemented by a network. We further use (nondeterministic) sampling to approximate the expectation in the ELBO expression. We do not use L2 parameter regularization. The KL term in the ELBO expression (1) is commonly interpreted as a regularization.   \n\nRegarding data visualization, we are interested here primarily in clustering (and data generation). If the goal would be data visualization in the latent space, we could replace the simple Gaussian model z ~  N(0,I) with a different Gaussian for each cluster, namely, z|y=i  ~  N(\\mu_i,\\Sigma_i).\n\nWe were not aware of [1] since it is not a published paper, which seems interesting and relevant. The idea there is quite different - In contrast to our method, they use one decoder to reconstruct the samples, and the clustering is performed in the latent space, like in the VaDE architecture.

To this end, some approximations are made to the ELBO by using the MAP value to replace the expectation as well as dropping some KL term.
