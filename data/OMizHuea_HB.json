However, obtaining a tight lower bound requires a sample size exponential in MI and thus a large set of negative samples. We can incorporate more samples by building a large queue-based dictionary, but there are theoretical limits to performance improvements even with a large number of negative samples. We hypothesize that random negative sampling leads to a highly redundant dictionary that results in suboptimal representations for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an active contrastive learning approach that builds an actively sampled dictionary with diverse and informative items, which improves the quality of negative samples and improves performances on tasks where there is high mutual information in the data, e.g., video classification.

This work is another addition to the ever-growing literature on self-supervised learning (SSL) with emphasis on video and multi-modal data. The main contribution of this work is the manner in which it tackles a well-known drawback of contrastive learning, namely the strategy used to sample negatives in the contrastive pipeline. The authors propose an active sampling strategy that adaptively chooses negative samples that are informative and diverse. This active selection technique is similar in spirit to many selector functions proposed in the active learning literature. It seems to be the first time it is used for contrastive SSL. \n\nBased on all the reviews and the subsequent discussions, it seems that the reviewers' comments were addressed.

To overcome the high redundancy in the negative samples, they propose an active negative sampling method. They use a gradient with respect to the pseudo label to measure the uncertainty of a negative sample. They use K-means clustering to maximize the negative sample diversity when constructing a new negative set for queueing. They show their method's efficacy on the public benchmarks: Kinetics, AudioSet for retraining, and UCF-101, HMDB-51, ESC-50 for downstream tasks.\u00a0\n\n#### Strengths\n* The problem is interesting and relevant to the community. Audio-visual self-supervised learning could be interesting for many researchers in the computer vision community.\n* Design choice looks reasonable and effective. Cross-modal contrastive learning gives a significant boost to performance. Active sampling gives a significant boost.\u00a0\n* Writing is straightforward and easy to follow.\n\n#### Weaknesses\nHowever, I have a few concerns about this work.\n* To show the effectiveness of the proposed gradient-based active sampling method compared to the embedding-based active sampling, the authors plot the number of action categories vs. the number of training iterations in Figure 2. However, in my opinion, more action categories might not mean high diversity in a negative set. For example, an action could be compositional. \"Drinking coffee\" action consists of \"picking up object\", \"approach an object\", \"bring an object to the actor\". Since the proposed method uses 16 frames, very short, feature encoding, the embeddings will be more towards these subactions, not the entire actions. Therefore, more action categories do not directly mean more diverse negative examples. So I would suggest the authors directly compare the downstream task performance of gradient-based sampling and embedding-based sampling.\n* The comparison of the proposed method with the fully supervised method is unfair. The fully supervised method has VGG-M-2048 as a backbone and pretrained on ImageNet, while the proposed methods have 3D-ResNet-18 or R(2+1)D-18 as a backbone and pertained on Kinetics or AudioSet. It is also unclear which row of \"ours\" the authors compare to the fully supervised method. I cannot find a 7.2p improvement on the UCF-101 and the 14.1p improvement on the HMDB-51 compared to the fully supervised method. It is okay that the proposed self-supervised method is weaker than the fully supervised method. However, the comparison should be fair, in my opinion.\n\u2028\nI will increase my rating if the authors adequately address my concerns.\n\n#### Minor comments:\n* 6.

We added new results (Table 2) to clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our gradient-based embedding over a feature-based embedding. We find that our approach outperforms the feature-based approach by a large margin across all three downstream benchmarks. This is because the gradient embeddings directly estimate the samples\u2019 influence on the current model, which conveys information about the model\u2019s uncertainty; this is missing in the feature embeddings. We add more detailed analysis in main paper (Sec. Feature vs. gradient embedding.).\n\n* RE: Comparison with a fully-supervised method. We removed this claim from our paper and updated Table 4 with fully-supervised results from GDT [Patrick et al., 2020], which show the highest accuracy compared to all the other self-supervised results using the same backbone (90.5% UCF101; 70.4% HMDB51). To clarify, the previous results that we included in our original submission (82.8% UCF101; 46.7% HMDB51) are from an older version of the XDC paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12667v1.pdf) which has now been updated with new results (v3). \n\n* In addition, we\u2019d like to clarify how we calculated the 7.2% and 14.1% performance gains on UCF101 and HMDB51.

There's no disagreement between both reviews, and I have checked both for correctness, so I provide both of them below: [so it's a 2-in-1 review option.]\n\n================\n\nThe paper is straight-forward, easy to read and clearly written. It builds on the Momentum Contrast (MoCo) paper (2020), which aims for a moving average dictionary per modality along with cross-modal contrastive learning for self-supervised tasks, evaluated on audio-visual datasets. The paper takes this a step further by arguing for a more active way to select negative samples that form the dictionary (or negative memory). While dictionaries are efficient ways to perform contrastive learning, this paper showcases that the random selection of negative samples can have a substantive impact on the performance.\nTo resolve this, the paper proposes to select negatives based on two criteria: informativeness measured by the gradients of the sample and diversity (or representativeness of the potential classes) through a greedy (or online) K-means approach. When both are utilised, the result showcases state-of-the-art on downstream recognition tasks on 3 standard datasets. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nThe paper is scientifically correct and the proposal is explained both theoretically, with equations, with an algorithm and supported by results. \n\nMy only concern with the paper is that by the end of the introduction, the proposal and concept are already well-stated. The rest of the paper keeps repeating the same argument. Apart from the introduction, only 3.3 offers more details. Related work, sections 3.1 and 3.2, figure and algorithm all repeat the same thing in various forms. While emphasis is good, I found the repetitiveness to affect my interest in reading the paper. I recommend that the authors revisit their manuscript to remove the repetitive argument (e.g. the notion that you need both informative and diverse negative samples is made in 4 different locations). \nInstead, the authors can provide more insight into the negative dictionary for the variety of models and datasets, showcasing the impact on certain classes. They can also discuss failure cases and whether they relate to classes that are still under-represented in active negative sampling. Comparing an online to offline diversity options (to know the upper limit) would also be interesting.\n\nAdditionally, the need for fully connected layers (described in page 6) is only showcased for XMoCo, and not for the final proposal. An ablation of its effect on the final proposal would be important to include.\n\n==============\n\nSummary\n\nThis paper proposes an approach to actively sample negative examples for audio-visual representation learning and combines this with an audio-visual approach for contrastive learning. The paper suggests that an active sampling approach that samples datapoints that are are both diverse and uncertain would result in a much more informative dictionary of negative samples, and uses gradient information and the k-MEANS++ algorithm to create such a dictionary of negatives. They then perform a cross-modal dictionary lookup where the queries and keys for each modality are each represented by a learnt encoder where the parameters of the query encoders are learnt directly via backpropogation and the key encoders' parameters are defined as a moving average of the query encoders' parameters. A contrastive loss is then used to learn a representation that is effective for fine-tuning to down-stream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results for both action recognition and audio event classification.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe paper presents novel, well motivated results in the field of cross-modal representation learning. It includes detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art across a wide selelection of papers and datasets. The proposed method shows state-of-the art results across small, medium and large pre-trained datasets for both action recognition and audio even classification.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWhilst there are detailed comparisons between related works the paper does not discuss many of these related works in the related work section. It would be nice to have some more information on the related works, how they relate, how they differ and the gap that this work fits into.\nAdditionaly, some information on the models used for audio and visual encoders would help with understanding. They are described in the appendix but there is no reference to them in the main text. The paper adopts a style wherein the entire process is shown as a single algorithm, and the text describes the algorithm step-by-step. This is, in general, quite clear, however continually changing pages to check the algorithm can decrease readability. Perhaps putting the full algorithm in the appendices and providing a simplified version in the main body would be clearer, or alternatively, splitting the algorithm in to multiple, smaller components.\nThe comparisons to related work are quite detailed, however, in some cases the proposed method offers only a marginal improvement (particularly for the medium and large datasets). Running some experiments multiple times and including error bars would strengthen the state-of-the-art claims. The comparisons could also be improved by consistently comparing across the same architectures. For example, the proposed method is only trained with R(2+1)D-18 for the large dataset, despite the architecture being widely used within the medium dataset comparisons. Perhaps two or three architectures across each dataset size would further strengthen comparisons.\n\nFurther points:\n*) typo: \"meduim scale\"\n*) Random overleaf link in the appendix\n*) references to relevant sections in the appendix would be nice\n", "title": "Nice trick, well-motivated and supported by results.

They also propose a sampling scheme for the negative examples. \n\nThe experiments and the corresponding ablations suggest that the proposed methods is helping overall. The table 1 suggests that adding the proposed components (cross-modal pretraining, active sampling for negative examples) seem to help overall. \n\nAlso, the samples in the appendix seem to suggest that the proposed `'active negative sampling``'  scheme seems to provide more relevant negative samples. Figure 2 in the experiments also show that the proposed negative sampling mechanism seem to increase the diversity in the negative samples.  Figure 2, also showcases that the proposed negative sampling scheme works better than picking out examples by looking at feature embeddings. This suggests that the proposed negative sampling scheme based on looking at gradients is advantageous over a more standard feature-level approach. \n\nI am not entirely sure if table 2 is exhaustive on the state-of-the-art (SOTA), but from what I gather from the narrative of the paper, they seem to improve the SOTA numbers on three different pretraining dataset size regimes for action recognition datasets. They also provide a similar experiment for audio event classification in table 3, and claim SOTA results. (where they pretrain on different datasets, and test on another) \n\nI think the clarity of the manuscript could be improved, especially in Section 3.3. I think that perhaps you could replace the low level algorithm with a higher-level pseudocode or a diagram and take the algorithm to the supplementary materials? \n\nAlso, my understanding of the proposed dictionary building / sampling approach for negative sampling is that you look at the magnitude of the gradients with respect to the contrastive learning objective, and pick the examples which give a large gradient magnitude. I think that this could be made clearer for the reader, perhaps by including a toy example, or including a figure in the appendix which showcases the gradient magnitude vs. the chosen negative examples.
