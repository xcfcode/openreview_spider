Remarkably, we find that deep Gaussian processes (DGPs), Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), infinite BNNs, and infinite BNNs with bottlenecks can all be written as deep kernel processes. For DGPs the equivalence arises because the Gram matrix formed by the inner product of features is Wishart distributed, and as we show, standard isotropic kernels can be written entirely in terms of this Gram matrix (we do not need knowledge of the underlying features). We define a tractable deep kernel process, the deep inverse Wishart process and give a doubly-stochastic inducing-point variational inference scheme that operates on the Gram matrices, not on the features (as in DGPs). We show that the deep inverse Wishart process gives superior performance to DGPs and infinite BNN on standard fully-connected baselines.", "keywords": ["Gaussian process", "doubly stochastic variational inference", "variational Inference", "Bayesian Inference"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper contributes to the literature of deep kernel learning by proposing a deep probabilistic model based on inverse Wishart distributions.

In the standard (non-DSVI) case, the complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(P_t^3)$, whereas in the inducing case, it is $\\mathcal{O}(P_i^3 + P_i^2 P_t)$.  Thus, by using a small number of inducing points, we are able to convert a cubic dependence on the number of input points into a linear dependence, which gives much improved scaling for DSVI.

In fact, DKP computational complexity is equivalent to that of non-deep inducing GPs, which are much more widely used.  Indeed, non-deep inducing GPs have been used on some very large problems (e.g. [1,2]).  Further, recent work [3] has shown that by exploiting the equivalence between Bayesian neural networks and DGPs, we can scale even DGPs to e.g. ResNet like models for CIFAR-10, and we believe that similar approaches might be applicable to DKPs.\n\nThe computational complexity of both deep kernel learning and DKPs is equivalent to shallow inducing GPs, so we might expect somewhat similar performance for these methods. However, it is important to note that deep kernel learning and DKPs aren't necessarily directly comparable: deep kernel learning maximizes over the NN parameters, whereas in the DKP we perform full Bayesian inference over all parameters at all layers. At the same time, deep kernel learning offers more flexibility in the neural network architecture (e.g. convolutions, batchnorm) that we are hoping to develop in future work for DKPs.\n\nWe leave an in-depth investigation of the tradeoff between accuracy and number of inducing points to future work, in part because it will be highly dependent on the dataset and kernel.

We agree that there is alot in the paper, and we had considered breaking it up.  The issue is that:\n * If we just wrote a paper on the observation that deep Wishart process are equivalent to DGPs, we wouldn't be able to do any experiments, because the approximate posterior we'd like to use, the non-central Wishart, has an extremely  expensive probability density function (Appendix E).\n * If we just wrote a paper on deep inverse Wishart processes observation, its importance wouldn't be clear, as it would be difficult to link to DGPs/BNNs.\n\nWe are planning to write a fleshed-out follow up for JMLR, and we will extensively update the paper to improve clarity, including in response to the other reviewers.\n\nWe have included extensive appendices, and hope that in combination with the main paper, they give sufficient detail  on all points.  If there are any areas you'd like us to elaborate a further on, we'd be happy to do that.\n\nThe family of kernels is anything that can be written as a function of the Gram matrix.  This includes isotropic kernels (as you state), but also the dot-product kernel, the relu-kernel (Cho and Saul 2009), the cosine kernel and others.  This captures almost all kernels used in practice in the GP literature, but we agree that it isn't every kernel you could use in a DGP.\n\nThere are two key advantages of DKPs over DGPs:\n  1. Primarily, DKPs allow for _much_ better posterior approximations than DGPs.  A DGP has rotational symmetries in  the true posterior (Appendix D2) which are not captured by standard approximate posteriors.  In contrast, Gram matrices don't have these symmetries, offering the possibility of much better posterior approximations.  In fact, we even believe that in certain cases, the DKP posterior might even be *unimodal*.  These improvements are reflected in the empirical results for the ELBO, which can be written as the model-evidence minus the KL-divergence   from the approximate to the true posterior.\n  2. DKPs allow us to optimize $\\delta_\\ell$ (Eq 16b).  This is analogous to a width parameter in a Bayesian neural network: as the width goes to infinity the Gram matrix at the next layer becomes deterministic and  we end up with an NNGP.  For smaller widths, the prior over representations is more flexible/variable.  Likewise, $\\delta_\\ell$ in a deep inverse Wishart process goes to infinity, the Gram matrix at the next layer becomes deterministic (and exactly the same as in a NNGP).  Critically, in a BNN, we can't optimize the width (because it is  fixed by the network architecture), and we definitely can't send the width to infinity (as GPU memory is fixed).  In  contrast, we are able to optimize the deep inverse Wishart process degrees of freedom, which allows us to control the flexibility of the prior over representations, and we are able to use very large degrees of freedom, if that is beneficial for modelling the data.", "title": "Response"}, "4xo0C7MGOe2": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ZUW6N_SVKxq", "review": "The paper proposes the deep kernel processes, which can generalize several existing deep kernel methods, including deep Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks.

The features in the intermediate layers are integrated out and the Gram matrix are Wishart distributed. A doubly stochastic variational inference method is proposed to learn DKPs. The idea looks novel to me. My major concern is about the writing.\n\n---\n##### Pros:\n\nThe paper is well-motivated and the idea is neat. For kernels that can be written as functions of the Gram matrix, DKP seems to be a better formulation than DGP. Due to difficulty in posterior inference, the authors propose to use inverse Wishart prior over Gram matrices. The use of inverse Wishart prior is explained and discussed in Appendix, which is satisfying. The authors also explain how the sparse variational inference method for DKP sidesteps the difficulties of capturing permutation and rotational symmetries in standard variational inference of BNNs or DGPs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\n---\n##### Cons: \n\nThe paper is hard to read and understand.

The paper begins by considering a DGP with isotropic kernels across the layers and realizes that the Gram matrices are Wishart distributed. Based on this, the paper proposes to bypass the inference of the features and sample the Gram matrices directly from Wishart distributions. This insight, in addition to the layered structure of DGPs, gives rise to the proposed prior distribution. Furthermore, given the restrictions of the Wishart distribution for modelling covariance matrices of arbitrary size [1], as well as the conjugacy properties of the inverse Wishart distribution, the paper uses the inverse Wishart distribution instead. Doubly stochastic variational inference is proposed for approximating the posterior distribution which includes the use of inducing points thanks to the marginalization properties of the inverse Wishart distribution. The experimental contribution consists of a comparison against DGP and Neural Network GP on the UCI, MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nIn terms of clarity, the readability of the paper is negatively affected by being too broad with the results presented. It seems that the equivalence between GPs with Wishart processes as priors and DGPs, BNN could be a paper on its own. Thus, no topic is presented with the depth needed. In regards to significance, it is not clear from the paper, how extensive is the family of kernels that can be generated from the prior distribution, given that the proposed model is equivalent to DGPs only in the case of isotropic kernels. In that sense, it is not clear from the paper why this approach would be beneficial over DGPs.\n\n[1] Amar Shah, Andrew Wilson, and Zoubin Ghahramani.
