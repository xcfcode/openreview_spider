In this paper, we propose two families of models built on a sequence to sequence model and a memory network model to mimic the k-Nearest Neighbors model, which generate a sequence of labels, a sequence of out-of-sample feature vectors and a final label for classification, and thus they could also function as oversamplers. We also propose `out-of-core' versions of our models which assume that only a small portion of data can be loaded into memory. Computational experiments show that our models outperform k-Nearest Neighbors, a feed-forward neural network and a memory network, due to the fact that our models must produce additional output and not just the label. As an oversampler on imbalanced datasets, the sequence to sequence kNN model often outperforms Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling.\n", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "the proposed approach of predicting k nearest neighbouring examples as an auxiliary task is an interesting idea. however, the submission should have studied further on how those examples are predicted (e.g., sequence prediction is one, but you could try set prediction, or so on) rather than how sequential prediction of nearest neighbours is done together with different types of classifiers (many of which are arguably not necessarily suitable for classification,) which was a sentiment shared by all the reviewers. \n\nmore careful investigation of different ways in which nearest neighbour prediction could be incorporated and more careful/thorough analysis on how the incorporation of this auxiliary task changes the behaviours or properties of the representation would make it a much better paper (also with clearer writing.)"}, "review": {"Bke-YtWv1V": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJgh5oCAA7", "comment": "Thank you for the response.

The intuition is that by training on a related but harder task,\nthe network is forced to learn not just about sampled points but about the\nbehavior in regions around the actual training examples.\n\nTheir work shows that imposing these additional requirements on the model does\nresult in better performance on unseen data, where only the label of the unseen\ndata point is required as output.  They show that learning more about the \nglobal {feature,label} distribution improves F1 scores, and suggest that their\nmethods can be used as an example generator for datasets with class imbalance.\n\nThe writing was clear.  I had only 1 misunderstanding that cause me trouble,\nnamely the first sentence of \"Classification\", where I might put the word\n'benchmark' up front rather than at the end of this somewhat long sentence.\nBy the time 'knn benchmark' appeared some paragraphs later, I realized I\nhad missed something, and had to backtrack.\n\nFigs 1--3 are only viewable on screen with fairly extreme magnification. I\nfound different viewers varied in legibility at these extreme zoom settings.\nHowever, when expanded so y-axis numbers could be deciphered, it turned out\nthat actual improvements in F1 score were rather modest.\n\nFor 4 datasets, their F1 scores of their best method, V2VSLS, improved by ~ 1.5\nto 6%.  They found that their methods were less affected by out-of-core\ncomputation than the benchmark kNN F1 scores.\n\nI did have some questions about the problem formulation.  I did not really\nunderstand why the models wanted to reproduce the exact ordering of the\nnearest neighbors, other than this is easy to formulate.  This makes sense\nfor n.n. label sequences, where further points might be in some neighboring\nclass.  But for predicting the feature vectors of n.n., it seems that the\nexact order is not robust, in the sense very small distance changes can cause\nabrupt shifts in the target nearest-neghbor ordering.  Is there some way\nfor me to understand why this does not pose a problem?  Or is there perhaps\na way to make the loss function a bit less dependent on the precise order\nof the generated feature vector sequence?\n\nIn the computational experiments, with the choice of datasets, it was often\nhard for me to judge how much different aspects of their 4 network structures\nwere really being excercised.  The main issue is the all problems used only\n2--3 classes.  I could not guess what fraction of data points had actual label\nchanges within the 5 n.n..  For many datasets, \"same class\" might be a pretty\ngood predictor of nearest neighbor label.\n\nAlternatively, one can consider the other extreme, of very many classes.\nDoes it still make sense to try to predict the order of nearest neighbor labels in\nsuch a setting?\n\nThe authors provide evidence of some performance improvement, but I would\nencourage them to provide some intuition about what the networks are actually\nlearning.  Some of this can be done with their existing data.\n\nFor example, on average, what are the distances from predicted feature vectors\nto the actual nn feature vectors?  If the feature sequence is typically badly\npredicted, then this might allow the authors to propose that the network is\n*actually* learning some simpler features of the the distributions underlying\nan actual {feature,label} sequence.  This might allow simplified training losses,\nbased, on things like direction and distance to same-label cluster center,\ndirection+distance to average same-class nn.s, direction and distance to\nclosest differently labeled cluster, etc.  Or does their data suggest that\ntheir models are actually learning the precise nearest neighbor ordering?\n\nSuch considerations might be able to improve the OOC training, since\n\"global\" aspects of the distribution features (like \"cluster center\")\nremain approx. valid as training batches changes.\n\nThe other question I had was with the oversampling proposition.  The extent\nof class imbalance in the datasets is not described.  Perhaps it belongs in\nTable 1.  Their approach seems a lot of work for modest gains usually available\nwith oversampling.  Can the authors provide any guideline for how many members a\nminority class should have before using their sequence-to-sequence technique?\n\nPros: they improve generalization to unseen data.\nCons: their models are considerably more complex, and they do not analyze their\ndata in enough detail to suggest whether their complexity is necessary, or perhaps\ncould be reduced.  Figures are too small (many unreadable in printed copy).\nDatasets have very few classes and the extent to which nearest neighbors are\nof different class not reported.\n", "title": "Training to predict kNN features and labels improves generalization.", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "HyxLBU-9h7": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rJl4BsR5KX", "review": "I had a hard time understanding this paper. The approach is clearly about combining kNN with neural networks, but it wasn\u2019t clear how it is done. After reading the whole paper, my guess is that kNN is done on raw data first, and then its results are used for training a neural network. In particular, a network is trained to predict the labels of neighboring samples, which are obtained by kNN beforehand. A simple figure explaining it in the introduction would be very helpful since the idea is not that complex. \n\nAlso, the authors also fail to give an adequate explanation on why the method works. The only reason I can think of is that this regularization forces the model to detect if a sample near a class boundary. This is because when a sample is far from boundaries and surrounded by samples of the same class, the model would simply predict that class label. The same is true when predicting out-of-sample vectors because the average position of K'th neighbor is likely to overlap with the input sample due to the randomness of sampling. \n\nI don\u2019t really see why a memory-based model is introduced. The external memory is used for holding random samples. It is not clear how the model can use such random samples for making predictions. Also, the authors give no explanation to why it should help. The results also don\u2019t show the benefit of a memory-based model. Maybe the authors should look into models that output a set instead of a sequence since neighbors are more like a set in their structure.\n\nThe experimental results show clear improvements over basic baselines, so the method is doing some regularization. However, I'm not very familiar with datasets used here and their state-of-art. They are relatively low dimensional compared to usual datasets used in deep learning. It is not clear if the method can scale to high dimensional data such as images. The vanilla neural network is not really a strong baseline here. Since the authors proposed a regularization technique, it should be compared with other regularization techniques in neural networks.\n\nPros:\n- a simple idea\n- encouraging experimental results\n\nCons:\n- confusing read\n- no clear intuition is given\n- restricted to low-dimensional datasets\n- strong baselines needed\n- the plots are too small to see (impossible to see when printed)\n\nOther comments:\n- The authors are using the term \"feature vector\" to refer to a data point.

Regarding the first point, we can regard the input as the sequence of length 1, and then the seq2seq model can be applied in this situation.\n\nRegarding the second point, an order is quite natural \u2013 based on the distance from the sample. In summary, while there is no direct order, the order based on the distance makes sense in our opinion. When predicting the label of a sample, the model tries to predict $k$ probability distributions and mimic \u201cmajority voting.\u201d We have also tried changing the loss function to be less (or not) dependent on the order of the feature vector sequence: we tried changing the sum of MSE losses (Sum (X^T_i \u2013 X^P_i)^2) to the MSE loss between every X^P_i and the average feature vector (Sum (X^T_i)/k) or the feature vector X itself. The experiments show that our current loss function (dependent sequence) outperforms these options (independent or less dependent sequence). To get a better handle on the order, we are currently conducting an experiment where we swap some elements in the order. We will post here the findings as soon as we have them. \n\n[UPDATE] To get a better handle on the order of nearest neighbors, we have tried to arbitrarily swap the 1st and the 3rd element in the order, and the results only have a tiny difference.

The results suggest that the order of nearest neighbors does not have a big impact. Note also that in our loss function there is a KL divergence term between the ground truth label and the final predicted label with a high weight.\n\nRegarding the third point, in our results, our model outperforms a fine-tuned neural network (with regularization, using the Adam optimization algorithm, etc.), random forest, XGBoosting etc., which we consider as the state-of-the-art general classifiers.

There is a gap between our models and Wang\u2019s model, and we were unable to further improve the Wang's model. \n\nRegarding the fourth point, I assume you were referring to the memory networks models and V2VS. That is correct \u2013 we wanted to assess whether those different structures would improve the performance, and unfortunately, they do not perform well. We are reporting these results in order for other researchers not to spend time on such attempts.

Your understanding is correct \u2013 kNN is done on raw data first, then the results are used for training a neural network. Regarding the reason of why the method works, we postulate that this is because the model is forced to learn more than just the final label of a sample; it also needs to learn its nearest feature vectors. The idea is similar to an autoencoder, which is able to compress and then recover the data. By projecting the data to a lower dimensional space, the model is forced to learn the most representative information of inputs, so that the compressed information can be used to recover the original data. If the model is forced to reconstruct more complex information from compressed information, it is expected that it needs to work harder and thus to produce more exact predictions. \n\nRegarding the reason why we consider a memory network, the structure of a vanilla memory network fits perfectly with our original thought: after each hop of a memory network, the network outputs a label or a feature vector. This is very similar to the sequence to sequence concept. However, experiments show that the memory network family does not perform well \u2013 the sequence to sequence family works much better. We wanted to assess whether those different structures would improve the performance, and unfortunately, they do not perform well.

Besides, the final label of the classification task will be learned, a sequence of nearest neighbor labels and a sequence of out-of-sample feature vectors (for oversampling) will be also learned in the same time, similar with the multi-task approaches. Since the proposed models are based k-nearest neighbor calculations, which is time-consuming, they also design an algorithm for the \u2018out-of-core\u2019 situation, say load a small portion of data each time to approximately calculate the neighbors. Experiments show that some proposed models work better than baselines in classification and oversampling.\nStrong points:\n(1) As similar with the multi-task setting, the proposed model can output some side useful results, such as oversampling vectors.\n(2) The proposed models work well on the \u2018out-of-core\u2019 situation, which shows that the models are robust.\nConcerns or suggestions:\n(1) The training data $x$ is just one data point, it is not a sequence of data.
