Yet, the ability to train at the edge is becoming increasingly important as it enables applications such as real-time adaptability to device drift and environmental variation, user customization, and federated learning across devices. In this work, we address four key challenges for training on edge devices with non-volatile memory: low weight update density, weight quantization, low auxiliary memory, and online learning. We present a low-rank training scheme that addresses these four challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. We then demonstrate the technique on a representative convolutional neural network across several adaptation problems, where it out-performs standard SGD both in accuracy and in number of weight updates.", "keywords": ["low rank training", "kronecker sum", "emerging memory", "non-volatile memory", "rram", "reram", "federated learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The reviewers generally agreed that the novelty of the work was very limited.

The main contribution is an algorithm called Streaming Kronecker-Sum Approximation. The authors claim that the proposed method addresses four key challenges of low weight update density, weight quantization, low auxiliary memory, and online learning.\n\nThe paper should be rejected because of the following reasons:\n(1) The paper is a little hard to follow and the writing can be significantly improved. In particular, the authors introduce four main challenges in section 3. However, I found they are not that accessible and hard to understand. In section 4.4.2, the objective is to get a minimum variance rank-r approximation to the diagonal matrix \\Sigma, but I think the authors mix \"m\" up with \"r\".\n(2) The novelty of the algorithm is limited. From section 4.1 to 4.5, most discussions are about previously proposed methods. The algorithm proposed by the author (i.e., SKS) only involves some basic manipulations of linear algebra. I don't think it's novel enough to be a new algorithm.\n(3) Experimental results are limited. The authors spent a lot of time discussing on-device computing, but all their experiments are just simulations on standard benchmarks. For such a paper concerning training on edge devices, I would expect to see some experiments on real edge devices.\n\nOverall, I think the paper needs further improvements to be qualified for being accepted.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\npost rebuttal:\n\nI've read the authors' responses and the updated paper. Though my concern on writing has been resolved to some extent, I'm still unsatisfied with the empirical experiments. I believe the authors need to do experiments on edge devices since they have emphasized a lot about on-device computing.

This paper proposes a low-rank training schema that helps mitigate some of the critical challenges that occur during training models on NVM memory-based edge devices. Additionally, two techniques, namely streaming batch norm and gradient max norm, are proposed to help training in an online setting. The proposed method is mainly based on approximating the Kronecker sum and is largely inspired by (Benzing et al, ICML 2019, Optimal Kronecker-sum approximation of real time recurrent learning). The proposed approach provides a few optimizations that improves this performance further, and outperforms SGD in terms of accuracy and the number of weights updates in a limited experimental setting.\n\n+ves:\n+ Training on an edge device is a relevant setting, where there is very little work so far, and this is a useful objective.\n+ Focusing on the Kronecker sum and speeding it seems like an interesting solution to solving this problem.\n+ The experimental settings considered (e.g. flipping bits and adding Gaussian noise to weights) is interesting, and perhaps of larger relevance to other work in the area.\n+ The ablation studies provided in the appendix are useful and appreciable.\n\nConcerns:\n- The key concern is that most of the proposed method is built upon Benzing et al\u2019s work (ICML 2019), and the original contribution seems limited. While the paper introduces a few optimizations further, this seems to be incremental than originally novel.\n\n- The problem is formulated for linear regression with least-squares loss, and the experimentation is carried out on the MNIST dataset (classification setting). How is the methodology relevant to the cross-entropy loss, typically used for classification? The paper does not talk about this.\n\n- The results are shown for a network with four 3 x 3 convolution layers and two fully connected layers on the MNIST dataset. Results with different architectures on a few other datasets (at least CIFAR-10) would be necessary to assess the usefulness of this method. Some discussion on what would be the maximum depth of the network that can be trained using this training schema and hardware would be very useful. \n\n- Do all deep neural network architectures (and loss functions) admit a Kronecker sum representation? What class of models can benefit from this method? Factorizations such as Cholesky allow to interpolate between computational complexity and decomposition rank by tuning a rank hyperparameter. Why would such factorizations not be better for memory-constrained settings?\n\n- It would be interesting to see the results using the proposed algorithm on standard hardware, will it provide the same performance as SGD when the scale of the problem increases in terms of layers and other regularization techniques, etc.? This would help understand the performance of the algorithm in a standard-setting.\n\nMinor issues:\n- The paper could have been organized better. Most of the main paper is used to describe Benzing et al\u2019s method, and a lot of the details of the original contributions are in the Appendix. While the equations discussed in Section 4 hold for Linear Regression, the same cannot be directly extended for other networks like CNNs. Considering all the experiments are on CNNs, Sec B.2 in the Appendix should have been in the main paper to help a reader follow the experiments. \n\n=====POST-REBUTTAL COMMENTS========\nI thank the authors for the rebuttal. The paper's organization is much better now. Unfortunately, there are many concerns which are still not convincingly answered: (i) Considering the focus of this work (as admitted by the authors in the rebuttal) is empirical and with limited technical novelty, more comprehensive results on many datasets are required. To some extent, transfer to ImageNet addresses this partially, but not convincingly enough; (ii) It is not clear from the authors' rebuttal why testing this on standard hardware is not possible/appropriate. The rebuttal says \"hard to quantify due to a variety of factors\" but that is vague without stating the factors.\n\nI am willing to increase the rating from 3 to 4, but am unfortunately still towards rejecting the current shape of this work. I believe the work will benefit from considering all reviewers' comments more comprehensively to have a more impactful paper.\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "3: Weak Reject", "confidence": 2}, "Hyxzg_vAFS": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkeXL0NKwH", "review": "This paper proposes a low rank training method called the Streaming Kronecker Sum approximation (SKS algorithm) for training low precision models on edge devices.

Our breakdown of the section into two components ((1) computation of the SVD; (2) min-var unbiased estimator of Sigma) was an attempt to provide some intuition for the result.\n(d) SVD - There is no straightforward answer to this.

In deep learning experiments, however, SKS seems to have better empirical performance.\n(e) Contributions - These are not the only contributions.

However, we decided that this way of organizing/motivating the paper was confusing and overly circuitous. Our new paper organization gets straight to the point in Section 3.\n(c) We address this in the global response, point (3).

Because Kronecker sums are the form the derivative takes, it is natural to base our low-rank representation off of this form. Keep in mind that for our application, having low-rank gradients is good, but the weights themselves do not need to be low-rank since the NVM we are using to store weights is spatially dense.\n(e) I agree this would be interesting, although hard to quantify due to the variety of factors affecting algorithm performance on any specific hardware.

We hope that these revisions address most of the reviewer's concerns. To reduce redundancy, we will discuss the key changes here and leave reviewer-specific comments below their respective comments.\n\n1) Paper organization - A number of reviewers found the paper organization confusing. We have addressed this by cutting the less important background sections and being upfront (in Section 3) with the key observation that makes low rank training so well suited for NVM systems. We have also simplified this explanation significantly by focusing on two key challenges (instead of four).\n\n2) Limited novelty - The main purpose of our paper is to make the argument that the low-rank training methods developed for RNN training applications can be used in training NVM systems. As such, it should be expected that algorithmic innovations would be more modest, in comparison to empirical tests. However, another source of novelty can come from analyzing why (or under what conditions) the technique would transfer to this new problem domain successfully. In our paper revision, we added a section analyzing convergence in the online convex setting, which can provide intuition for the key design knobs that allow effective optimization.\n\n3) Limited experiments - Our original experiments tested performance of different algorithms across a variety of different adaptation problems. However, they were all done with the MNIST dataset. At the time, we expected this might represent a realistic use case for the first generation of test chips. However, it has since become clear that larger problems may be of interest and realistically implementable in the near future. To address these more ambitious use cases, we added a suite of transfer learning-like experiments for ImageNet. Addressing one reviewer's concerns, these experiments are swept over different algorithms, ranks, and learning rates to get a better sense of relative algorithm performance. Some reviewers also commented on the lack of on-device experiments. However, since NVM is still in its infancy, we are not currently capable of testing on physical devices. Instead, our paper aims to straddle the boundary between algorithms and hardware.", "title": "Global Response to Reviewers"}, "r1liBXXTKB": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SkeXL0NKwH", "review": "This work presents a new online training scheme which is amenable to non volatile memories and particularly applicable to smart edge devices.

It seems important for the mixing of the lower SVD elements in the OK method but perhaps can be removed. \n\nI think for people less familiar with the area, a more intuitive explanation of section 4.4 would be helpful. \n\nGenerally how much does the algorithm suffer from using an SVD type approximation for learning?\n\nThe new contributions of this paper are to use a running estimate of Q_L, Q_R and weightings using modified Gram Schmidt. \n\nNot immediately clear how the scheme described related to the quantization point in the challenges. \n\nExperiments seem to show the proposed benefits but are done with artificial models/simulations.
