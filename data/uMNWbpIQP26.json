(2) What form of implicit regularization occurs through training? While significant progress has been made in answering both of these questions for gradient descent, they have yet to be answered more completely for general optimization methods. In this work, we establish sufficient conditions for linear convergence and obtain approximate implicit regularization results for generalized mirror descent (GMD), a generalization of mirror descent with a possibly time-dependent mirror. GMD subsumes popular first order optimization methods including gradient descent, mirror descent, and preconditioned gradient descent methods such as Adagrad. By using the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality, we first present a simple analysis under which non-stochastic GMD converges linearly to a global minimum. We then present a novel, Taylor-series based analysis to establish sufficient conditions for linear convergence of stochastic GMD. As a corollary, our result establishes sufficient conditions and provides learning rates for linear convergence of stochastic mirror descent and Adagrad. Lastly, we obtain approximate implicit regularization results for GMD by proving that GMD converges to an interpolating solution that is approximately the closest interpolating solution to the initialization in l2-norm in the dual space, thereby generalizing the result of Azizan, Lale, and Hassibi (2019) in the full batch setting.

In the fifth line of the proof of theorem 3, page 15 of the appendix, I\u2019m not sure how you upper bound the quantity - < \\nabla f(w^(t)), J_\\phi^-1 \\nabla f_{i_t}(w^(t)) > by the right hand side. Of course, the Jacobian is assumed to be positive definite, but how does this upper bound follow? Besides, I found the claim in Theorem 3 quite interesting, and even surprising. It seems to me that SGD, which is SGMD with mirror maps equal to identity, satisfies the conditions of Theorem 3, simply because the mirror map is the identity. Then, the result claims an exponential convergence rate for SGD to the global optima. Can you clarify this, in light of the minimax lower bounds for SGD in smooth and strongly convex setting, e.g. the recent work: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8624-tight-dimension-independent-lower-bound-on-the-expected-convergence-rate-for-diminishing-step-sizes-in-sgd.pdf\n\n- Novelty/Significance of the results: Theorem 3 is novel and seems very interesting, if the authors clarify the issue above, as well as clarify the generality of the assumption, i.e. the conditions required for the Jacobian of the mirror map. Can you clarify what are the technical challenges in proving Theorem 1, and what are the novelties with respect to several related work, including the work of Karimi et al., 2016?\n\n- Clarity: In my humble opinion, Theorem 4 cannot be interpreted as an \u201capproximate implicit regularization\u201d effect, simply because the distance to the optimum measured in the mirrored space can be very large, and the authors do not provide examples when this can actually be small. In the remarks, you point out \u201cHence provided that R is small (which holds for small f(w(0))), GMD selects an interpolating solution that is close to w*  in \\ell_2-norm in the dual space\u201d. But why should one expect f(.) to be small at the initialization? Specifically, this theorem is proved under the assumption that f(.) is non-negative, therefore, f(w^(0)) being small simply means that w^(0) is already an approximate global optimum.\n\n- Presentation: I think there is room for improving the writeup. Here are some examples:\n   + The presentation of MD-type updates in Equation (1) is quite abrupt, without providing the motivation/context.\n   + All of the main theorems guarantee linear convergence without actually characterizing the rate of convergence. I found it very confusing as it hides the dependence on important parameters.\n   + The presentation of the PL* condition in section 3 is very confusing as none of the main results (Theorems 1-3) requires this condition. What is the motivation? It seems that this condition is not preserved under simple transformations such as translation, i.e. if f(X) satisfy PL* then f(x) + 1 will not. What are some interesting function classes that satisfy this property?\n   + Do the assumptions of Lemma1 (PL*, smoothness, non-negativity) imply existence of x* such that f(x*) = 0?\n   + Can the monotonicity condition in Theorem 4 be restated in terms of strong/strict convexity of the potential function associated with the mirror map?\n   + The sufficient conditions in theorems 2 and 3 are not discussed at all. What are some examples of interesting potential functions / Bregman divergences that satisfy these conditions?\n\nFor the reasons listed above, I don\u2019t think this paper is ready to be published at ICLR.

This paper does not actually show the benefit of replacing the gradient of the Bregman function by a general mapping in mirror descent. The analyses are standard and do not actually get more difficult with the generalization. The theorems require the derivatives of the Bregman function to be bounded, making the result not even applicable to entropic mirror descent, arguably the most notable instance of mirror descent. \n\n\n##########################################################################Pros: \n \n\nPros: \n\n1. None. I have not seen a proof showing mirror descent converges linearly with the Polyak-Lojaciewicz condition in literature, so this could be a novelty. But the analyses in this paper are just standard and very restrictive because they require the Bregman functions to have bounded derivatives. \n \n\n##########################################################################\n\nCons: \n\n1. I do not see the benefit of replacing the gradient of the Bregman function by a general mapping \\phi. The authors use gradient descent, mirror descent, and AdaGrad as examples of the \u201cgeneralized mirror descent\u201d in Section 5. However, it is already known that gradient descent is a special case of mirror descent and AdaGrad is mirror descent with a time-varying Bregman function. All three do not need the notion of a \u201cgeneralized mirror descent.\u201d\u2028\n\n2. The proposed \u201cgeneralized mirror descent\u201d is not actually more general than mirror descent. The assumption on \\phi in Theorem 1, for example, coincides with the standard assumption in mirror descent literature that the Bregman divergence is strongly convex. Moreover, the condition that \\phi is Lipschitz is restrictive (for example, it does not hold for entropic mirror descent) and does not appear in standard mirror descent literature. The conditions on the derives of \\phi are even more restrictive in Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. \u2028\n\n3. The theorems in this paper only states that the algorithms converge linearly. Please make an optimal choice of the step sizes and make the dependence of the convergence rate on the problem and algorithm parameters explicit. Also please make sure that the exponent in the linear convergence rate does not depend on the iteration counter, as opposed to those shown in the appendix. \u2028\n\n4. The paper starts with a discussion on overparameterization. However, I do not see the connection of this paper with explaining the benefit of overparameterization. Indeed, the analyses in this paper has nothing to do with overparameterization, unless the authors connects the PL condition with overparameterization. \u2028\n\n5. Isn\u2019t the PL^* condition simply the PL condition with the objective function shifted by -f(x^*)? As long as f(x^*) is finite, without loss of generality, one can always do such a shifting and the sequence of iterates does not change. I do not think PL^* is a new condition. \n \n\n##########################################################################\n\nAfter reading the rebuttal: \n\nI keep the score. \n\n- In my view, the Taylor-series analysis is a very straightforward approach such that existing frameworks apply to the setup considered in this paper. Such a straightforward approach renders the results restrictive and hence I do not consider it a significant novelty. \n\nThe proof of Theorem 1 just rewrites the existing proof with minor modifications for the considered setup and hence do not require any additional restriction. Emphasizing Theorem 1 is not very appropriate for the rebuttal. \n\n- The \"generalization\" I mentioned is for the \\phi function. There are already several works on mirror descent/FTRL with a time-varying regularizer (Orabona et al. (2015) is for FTRL, as clarified in Orabona's lecture notes on online learning). Without an example where the \\phi function is not the gradient of a potential function, I do not see the necessity of this generalization. \n\nFor the same reason above, emphasizing Theorem 1 is not very appropriate for the rebuttal. \n\n- My point is to clarify the dependence of the convergence rate on the problem parameters. I do not think the proofs in the appendices provide explicit characterizations of such dependence. To make such explicit characterizations, I think specifying *a* step size instead of *a range* of step sizes is perhaps necessary. \n\n- I suggest the authors rewrite the first two paragraphs to make the motivation of the problem setup clearer there. Section 2 is OK. \n \n\n#########################################################################", "title": "Analyses are standard and very restrictive", "rating": "3: Clear rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "DMUNl0vbsoc": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "uuqsJUpG2Ks", "comment": "We thank the reviewer for the review and address the concerns below.  \n\n* \u201cFirst, I'm not sure if one can obtain new, useful algorithms from the general algorithmic framework in the paper and/or deduce new convergence rate results for existing algorithms.

While the work by Karimi et al. 2016 provides a PL-based analysis for gradient descent, we identified additional conditions on \\phi under which this analysis could be extended to generalized mirror descent.  Theorem 1 is especially interesting since for mirror descent, these conditions essentially reduce down to the potential function being strongly convex (as discussed in Section 4).

(2019)].\n- If we consider $\\phi(w)=w$ which corresponds to the gradient descent, the result (3) is obvious from the triangle inequality. Hence, I am concerned about the importance of this result.\n\n[Improvement]\nIt would be nice if the authors could mention the above weakness.", "title": "This line of research is interesting, but I have some concerns.", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}}}
