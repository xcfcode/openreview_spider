GANs learn a probability through observations, using the objective function with a generator and a discriminator. While many empirical results indicate that GANs can generate realistic samples, the reason for such successful performance remains unelucidated. This paper focuses the situation where the target probability measure satisfies the disconnected support property, which means a separate support of a probability, and relates it with the advantage of GANs.  It is theoretically shown that, unlike other popular models, GANs do not suffer from the decrease of generalization performance caused by the disconnected support property.  We rigorously quantify the generalization performance of GANs of a given architecture, and compare it with the performance of the other models. Based on the theory, we also provide a guideline for selecting deep network architecture for GANs.

This work relies heavily on the results shown in [1] and [2] on the approximation power of Deep networks for non-smooth functions. The paper is globally well written and the proof seems sound. However, the experiments could be more convincing and the relevance of the result is questionable:\n\n- By choosing the function class F to the be L_1-lipschitz, the resulting error bound loses it\u2019s dependence on the smoothness beta and becomes slightly worse than the classical methods (equation 7 with kappa = 2+2D). Is this an artifact of the proof? if that is the case, it would be good to have a tighter bound: [3] might be a good starting point. \n- Neural networks used in practice are continuous usually, but it seems that all the analysis is all based on the fact that distributions with disjoint support require discontinuous networks. Can similar results be obtained in the more realistic case of continuous networks? Also what network architecture was used in the experiments?\n- Although the bound in eq (5) clearly shows a tradeoff for S_g it only says that S_f should be as small as possible. Of course, if S_f =0 there is no discriminative power, but it\u2019s unclear to me how the expression for S_f in eq (6)  can be obtained from (5) and why it would keep the discriminative power (in what sense?). Again, this tradeoff was discussed in prior work [3], so it might be worth looking into that direction.\n- The discussion right after lemma 1 doesn't seem to be true: a distribution might have disjoint support and still have a density (i.e.: absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure). It can even have a smooth density.\n- The experiment doesn\u2019t use the same metric to compare GANs method with other methods, so it is unclear how these methods compare. Moreover, figure 6 seems to show that other methods are also able to get the support right (Kernel E).

Though discontinuous networks are necessary for our setting (Lemma 2), we show that (continuous) ReLU networks can approximate the discontinuous network effectively (Lemma 3), hence the effectiveness of GANs is proved (Theorem 1).\n\n-That clarifies things, however I find that the discussion after lemma 2 rather missleading, if in the end the result ends up using continuous generator:\n\"Because of the discontinuity, generative models with smooth functions, such as an\nadversarial generative model with kernel generators (Sinn & Rawat, 2018), cannot work well with\ndisconnected supports.\"  \n\n- It is still unclear to me how the optimal value of S_f is obtained from eq (5). The author points out the work by Zhang+ (2018), but this should be clarified in the current version of the paper: What result in Zhang+(2018) do you use to get this value?\n\n- I find the experiments  not very convincing. I understand that the point is not to show that GANs are better than  other methods but it is important to be make meaningful compairisons (use comparable scores) otherwise there is little scientific value in figure 5 especially.  \n\n- As reviewer 1 mentions, lemma 3 is supposed to be one of  the main theoretical contributions of the paper, however, the proof seems very similar to the one in ([2], appendix B.1). Although the authors mention lemma 1 of [2] in the proof of lemma 3, it seems like the whole section in ([2] appendix B.1) is dedicated to show the very same result.\n\nFor all these reasons I still wouldn't recommend accepting this paper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: Yarotsky.

Thus, we let Theorem 1 formally guarantee an existence of the good DNN architecture.

We show that GANs perform better than other standard methods of estimating probability\nmeasures when the measure satisfies the disconnected support property.\n\nI prefer to state the contribution as \"We show that deep generative networks perform better than other standard methods of estimating probability measures when the measure satisfies the disconnected support property.\" This claim is essentially from Lemma 3, and it is a property of deep generative networks instead of GANs. If we have another way to train deep generative networks (say, variational auto-encode), we still get the same good approximation error, just linearly dependent of the number of disconnected pieces. The proof of Lemma 3 is mainly from the definition of locally smoothness and the results in Petersen & Voigtlaender 2017. It's a nice effort to leverage the result in Petersen & Voigtlaender 2017 to prove approximation properties of deep generative models. The flaw of this part is that the claims of other standard methods (Proposition 1) is very hand-wavy and floppy. The proof of Proposition 1 has lots of typos. For example, the definition of S_1 and S_2. And this sentence \"Then, by the proof of Lemma 1, p2(x) on S2 is a quadratic function with respect to z1 is 1-times differentiable but not twice-differentiable at the boundary ...\" I guess that the authors want to argue that traditional function approximation methods (like Kernel methods, polynomial approximation) all have rate n^{-1/(2+D)} approximation rate in the L^2 norm when the function to approximate has discontinuities... However, the authors fail to make this point clear. Moreover, if we use a mixture model of traditional approximations, the rate will not be deteriorated.  And we will get similar results in Lemma 3. Then, even the claim \"deep generative networks perform better than other standard methods of estimating probability measures when the measure satisfies the disconnected support property\" is not that grounded. \n\n\n2. We provide a new generalization error bound under a general formulation of GANs by analyzing an approximation error. The result is thus applicable to a wide range of variations of GANs.\n\nThis corresponding to the results in Theorem 1. The authors may want to write the assumption \"all the discriminators are L_1 Lipschitz continuous\" in the Theorem 1 explicitly, because this is an important assumption to get the results. The analysis in i & iii is standard. The analysis is the main contribution of this paper, and is from Lemma 3. \n\n3. Based on the generalization bound, we provide a theoretical guideline for selecting architectures\nof generators and discriminators. \n\nI think the authors mean Equation (6) in this claim. However, this practical guidance is not practical, because (1) both \\beta and \\kappa are unknown in practice, especially \\beta, (2) I can hardly image the number of connections (non-zero weights) will be my model design guidance instead of the model architecture. \n\nIn the numerical experiment, \"We use d_F to evaluate errors by GANs, and a root of the expected squared errors with the L2-norm for the other methods.\" With different metrics, is this a fair comparison?\n\nFinally, there are lots of typos in the paper and appendix. \"refers to a probability measures\", \"The property makes a probability measure be complex\", \"with disconnected support\", \"Theorem 1, Corollary 1 and ??\", \n\nAmong others, the original GAN(Goodfellow et al., 2014) is realized if F contains a logarithm of density ratio. The f-GAN (Nowozin et al., 2016) also belongs to this class.

It might be supported only on M disjoint components, each of which has a smooth boundary, within that compact set.\n- The latent noise dimension (inputs to the generator) is of the same dimension as the data.\n- An IPM loss (1) is used.\n- The discriminator functions of the IPM and the generator networks are both ReLU networks of at most L layers and at most S total nonzero weights, with all weights having magnitude at most B.\n- The discriminator functions are Lipschitz continuous; this is implied by the previous assumption, but the bound is tighter if we have a tighter constraint here.\n- We obtain the generator which exactly minimizes the IPM between the empirical distributions of m samples from the model and n samples from the target.\n- Maybe: there is some g such that P* is produced by g. It's not clear in your statement of Theorem 1 whether this is necessary, or exactly what it means when you say that in Lemma 3, and I haven't fully checked what's used yet; it would help to explicitly say this is not assumed if it's not.\n\nPointing out that the kinds of distributions handled by GANs often have disjoint support, and analyzing this case, is certainly of interest.\n\nThe full-dimensional support assumption is not ideal, but of course just because the analysis doesn't apply to most practical GAN settings doesn't mean it's not an important step towards one that does.\n\nAlso note that the assumption about the structure of the networks eliminates the MMD GANs that you use in experiments -- which have a kernel function at the top of the critic network -- though it does allow for most GAN variants. Maybe the most interesting algorithm for this setting is the Coulomb GAN (ICLR 2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08819 ), which uses a neural network critic of the kind you study but estimates a distance which (unlike the Wasserstein and most other GAN objective functions) has good statistical convergence properties (kappa=2 as you mention).\n\nMy biggest concern by far, though, is Proposition 1. You present it as if it's a lower bound: establishing that there is some class of distributions for which Theorem 1 shows that GANs can account for local smoothness and standard methods are shown not to be able to. This isn't what you do; instead you exhibit a class of distributions for which Theorem 1 shows that GANs can account for local smoothness, and previous analyses of standard methods do not show that they are able to take advantage of it. This is not the same thing at all! Although the previous upper bounds have matching lower bounds, you don't demonstrate (and it is likely not the case) that the distribution you show fits into the class of distributions used by the previous lower bounds, and so it remains very possible that other methods are able to take advantage of local smoothness as well as GANs do.\n\nGiven that Proposition 1 is hence a very weak statement, your main contribution in terms of disconnected support becomes \"we can show that GANs can adapt to disconnected supports (under these other assumptions) that has not previously been shown for other methods.\" Not only is this a weaker result, but the degree to which you show GANs can take advantage of local smoothness is somewhat limited: at least with the parameter choices in Corollary 1, the smoothness only improves m dependence, not n dependence.\n\nBut in the GAN setting, m is essentially a question of how long you optimize for (and the relative rates between generator and discriminator updates, and various other questions like that out of scope for this paper), not any kind of externally fixed limitation like n. It's perhaps not too surprising that you don't show that optimizing a WGAN is statistically easier than estimating Wasserstein the distance, but given that estimating Wasserstein is so hard in high dimensions, it's a little disappointing. (Maybe it's easier, so that kappa is smaller, with locally smooth densities as here, though I don't know of any results like that offhand.)\n\n(It's interesting, then, that in Corollary 1 the generator complexity depends only on m, basically the amount of optimization you're willing to do, while the discriminator complexity depends only on the available number of target samples n.)\n\nAnother concern is that to me, it is not very clear exactly what the statements of the assumptions mean. For example, does Theorem 1 apply only if I search over all generators in the class \\mathcal G = \\Xi(S_g, B_g, L_g)? In particular, does this mean that I have to consider all possible architectures matching those constraints, including allowing for all possible depths up to L_g, and all possible ways of allocating widths of the various interior layers / which weight entries are fixed at zero? It seems so, but this could be more explicit in the statements, even just by replacing \"an existing \\mathcal G\" with \"\\mathcal G = \\Xi(S_g, B_g, L_g)\" in the statement of (e.g.) Theorem 1.\n\nIn your numerical experiments: you don't make it at all clear enough that you're plotting *different loss functions* for the GANs and the other methods! (You say this, but only in the text where it should definitely also be in the figure caption.) What happens if you plot the L2 difference for all methods, and the MMD/Wasserstein for all methods? Looking at Figure 6, it's not obvious that the GAN would do so substantially better. (It does seem to perhaps have the overall scale of the two components better than the other methods, but it doesn't look like as enormous a difference as it seems from Figure 5.)\n\nOverall: Theorem 1 is of interest, but the results and especially the comparison to classic methods are not as resounding as they're presented here.\n\n(Note that I have not (yet) verified or even really read most of the proofs; I might come back and do that later.)\n\nSmaller points:\n\n- I don't think that f-GAN actually fits in the framework (1) as you claim, since it needs to use the conjugate of f on the samples from Q. Also, the original GAN does fit into (1) but not your assumptions about the network form of f, since it needs a log in its activations.\n\n- Another class of generative models where disconnected supports are really important is normalizing flows, which often build \"bridges\" between separated modes because (like your Lemma 2) their generators are constrained to be smooth and invertible. See e.g. Figure 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01367 (who propose a new normalizing flow less susceptible to these problems). \n\n- Remark 1 seems so obvious that it need not even be stated, since beta-smooth implies beta'-smooth for beta' < beta. It would only be interesting if you could actually take advantage of the smoother components somehow.\n\n- Many papers in your bibliography are cited only as arXiv preprints when they were actually published in various places. For example, the first four papers were published at ICLR 2017, ICML 2017, ICML 2017, and ICLR 2018, respectively.\n\n- There are many small typos and grammatical errors in the draft, including some that would be caught by a spell-checker (\"methdos\" on page 8), and an undefined LaTeX reference at the top of page 2. It would benefit from a thorough proofread.\n", "title": "Good stuff but comparison to other methods is overstated", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}}}
