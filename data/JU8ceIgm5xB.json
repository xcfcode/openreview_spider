Critically, the second of these is based on the conditional MI, I(x';y|x''), distinguishing it from previous work using multiple views that just take the marginal I(x';y).  Estimating this conditional MI transpires to be somewhat trickier due to the additional intractability from p(y|x''), with approximations suggested to get around this.  Experiments are performed on both vision and NLP problems.\n\n\n*Review Overview*\n\n\nI believe the premise of the paper is quite sensible and the general idea potentially useful, albeit somewhat incremental.  However, I am rather unconvinced by the approximations used to try and estimate p(y|x''); this rather lets the paper down as I feel this is the main technical challenge with the other contributions being rather straightforward.  Further, I feel the experimental results are somewhat weak, both in terms of the fact that the gains shown are quite small, but also because there are doubts as to whether these gains are actually statistically significant at all or just a somewhat \"engineered\" win that does not accurately reflect the underlying approaches.\n\n\n*Strengths*\n\n+ As far as I'm aware, the suggested approach has not appeared in the literature before.\n+ This is a highly active research area that is very much of interest to the ICLR community.\n+ The high-level idea of using subviews and breaking down the MI in this way seems sensible and potentially useful.\n+ The toy experiment in Figure 2 is helpful in showing that the approach can be helpful if p(y|x'') can be estimated well.\n+ It is good to see experiments on both vision and NLP problems.\n+ The paper is mostly quite easy to follow.\n\n\n*Weaknesses (in roughly decreasing order of importance)*\n- The experiments do not follow procedures that are clearly statistically sound and the gains could easily just be a result of luck and /or tweaking the approach until it works.  In particular, no error bars are provided for any of the results; different approaches are run for different problems without justification such that it feels like things are somewhat cherry-picked; additional heuristics are added to what is actually run without clear a priori motivation such that they feel rather based on trial and error and undermines whether the gains are actually from the suggested approach or just engineering the exact setup until it gives an improvement; some important details seem to be missing such as how lambda is chosen. \n- The experimental gains are rather modest.\n- The approximation methods for p(y|x'') are rather unconvincing: the variational bound requires a very complex learning problem in itself to encapsulate p(y|x'') while permitting optima that do not produce approximations that are close to this target at all, while the importance sampling approach is very much just a heuristic with rather flimsy justification.  More explanation on this is given later.\n- Much of the technical content, other than how one approximates p(y|x''), is very straightforward and is not enough to warrant publication on its own.  For example, the first time anything new is introduced is not until section 3.1 at the bottom of page 4, while the conditional InfoNCE bound/proposition 1 is trivial and arguably not even new to the literature (for example, equivalent bounds are already employed in conditional MI estimation in a Bayesian experimental design context, see e.g. http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/foster20a/foster20a.pdf).\n- Though not bad, the writing of the paper could definitely be improved.  In particular, the abstract and introduction could be much easier to follow and have a clearer narrative, while the initial explanations of what x, y, and the sub-views x' and x'' represent could be much clearer.\n- [Minor] I'm not a fan of the title.  \"Decomposing MI\" suggests you are making manipulations to the standard MI to ease estimation or focus on different things, rather than introducing additional views and then introducing separate bounds for each (the approach isn't even a true decomposition as its a bound on the original MI, not an equality).\n\n\n*Approximations*\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, one of my biggest misgivings is with the approximations employed to try and draw samples from p(y|x'').  This is at the core of the problem and arguably why most papers have steered clear of dealing with conditional MI directly.\n\nStarting with the variational approach, I have two issues:\n- Estimating p(y|x'') in this way is extremely difficult and is almost like learning a decoder in that we have to learn how to generate full data examples.  Though this is far from fatal in the context of the overall approach, it feels like if we are able to learn a good approximation for p(y|x''), we have already solved much of the challenge contrastive learning was trying to address in the first place.\n- More immediately worryingly, the resulting objective introduced (Eq 10) does not appear to guarantee that an effective contrastive learning scheme will be learned as there are unwanted ways this objective can be optimized.  \n\nTo be more precise about the latter point, the paper claims about Eq 10\n\n\"This suggests that using to sample contrastive sets retains the properties of being a lower bound on the conditional MI.\"\n\nThis is a strange phrase and not properly quantified: my interpretation of Eq (10) would be that the KL term being positive means using a variational approximation does not produce a valid lower bound in any useful sense.  In particular, because \\tau appears in both terms, it seems perfectly possible for there to be optima of Eq (10) that do not correspond to \\tau(y|x'') = p(y|x'') and consequently critics E that do not behave in the desired manner.  Essentially, it seems like the approach, at least in principle, can learn a tau that allows for easy discrimination to the contrastive samples rather than which represents the actual distribution; the first term could potentially just dominate the KL divergence (such a phenomenon is well documented in VAEs) and avoid learning anything useful.\n\nThis is not the end of the world if it does actually train properly in practice, but I think this needs to be directly demonstrated and the potential pitfalls that are there discussed.\n\nOn the other hand, with the \"importance sampling\" approach, there are many large and not fully justified jumps being made such that the final objective used (i.e. Eq 11) is more of an importance sampling inspired heuristic than any principled importance sampling estimate.  There are a lot of approximations going on here, from the weights themselves (they are only valid weights if E=E* and its not clear they will give anything particularly sensible when E\\neq E*)  to the rather unjustified jump from these to Eq 11.  In particular, deriving Eq 11 from the weights somewhat boils down to making the assumption E[1/X] = 1/E[X] which is typically a poor approximation (though interestingly might become exact in the limit K->\\inf). In short, I would suggest that the approach Eq (11) requires far more careful justification for it to be convincing that this is an approach one would a priori expect to behave in the intended manner.  Some sort of ablation study into how reasonable the approximation it provides is would also be extremely helpful (this could also be done for the variational approach).\n\n\n*Other Specific Comments *\n\n\n1. It would be good to explain what you mean by \"hard\" contrastive samples in the intro.\n\n2. The sentence \n\n\"We note that the bound (Oord et al., 2018) corresponds InfoNCE to a particular choice for the variational distribution q.\"\n\nis not quite true: the InfoNCE bound can be viewed as a lower bound on Eq (2) (not Eq (2) itself) for a particular choice of q as it still requires an extra invocation of Jensen's inequality.\n\n\n*Questions etc *\n\n\na. Is a stop gradient is used with the w_k to stop E from being indirectly trained through these?\n\nb. I would like to see the results of using the variational approach with the vision problem and the importance sampling approach with the NLP problem, or at the very least a justification for why this hasn't been done.  Without this the results feel a little cherry-picked.\n\nc. What is the performance you get when setting lambda=0?  This was the originally proposed method and, presumably, experiments were run on this so it is important to include them in the results, both so we can see how important the extra heuristic it conveys actually is, and because it relates to the statistical interpretation of the results (tuning lambda reduces the significance of the results as its an extra degree of freedom the baselines don't have).  Moreover, how was lambda actually chosen?  This seems to be missing from the paper.\n\nd. The experimental results are pretty meaningless without any sort of error bars.  The gains are quite small and it impossible to know at present whether they are the result of pure chance, or actual statistically significant improvements.  I would like to see repeat runs and the variability in the performance across these.\n\ne. Are the same adjustments used for the dialogue experiment as for the vision experiment?  In general, section 4.3 is quite hard to follow and seems to lack complete details for the exact setup used for the suggested approach (section 4.2 still has a few things missing as well like setting lambda).\n\nf. What is done with the bootstrap confidence intervals?  This was difficult to understand from the shortness of the explanation, while it is rather unsatisfactory to just quote that the results were significant at the 5% level rather than actually providing the variations, p values, and exact details of the test being done.", "title": "Unconvinced by approximations and experiments", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "iCKrjGObX_n": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "C2R8VJHX6Mn", "comment": "Thanks for the thorough and insightful review and for the time spent in deeply understanding our paper.

For example, the first time anything new is introduced is not until section 3.1 at the bottom of page 4, while the conditional InfoNCE bound/proposition 1 is trivial and arguably not even new to the literature( see http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/foster20a/foster20a.pdf).\"_\n\nWe weren\u2019t aware of Foster (2020), thanks, we have added the reference to our revision. That very recent and interesting paper proposes I_ACE in the context of BOED. We agree that in light of that paper, the conditional InfoNCE (I_CNCE) bound is similar (although we prove the form for the optimal E). Apart from I_CNCE and the proposed bounds and approximations on the conditional MI, we also feel that the idea of splitting MI into a sum of smaller MIs and maximizing each in turn (I_NCES) is novel and one of the central contributions of the paper. We stressed this point in the updated Section 3.\n\n_\"Though not bad, the writing of the paper could definitely be improved. In particular, the abstract and introduction could be much easier to follow and have a clearer narrative, while the initial explanations of what x, y, and the sub-views x' and x'' represent could be much clearer\"_\n\nWe are super happy to improve the writing. How would you suggest we could structure the narrative?\n\n_\"\"Decomposing MI\" suggests you are making manipulations to the standard MI to ease estimation or focus on different things, rather than introducing additional views and then introducing separate bounds for each.\"_\n\nWe feel our results are general and can be used outside of the concept of \u201cviews\u201d. For example, for any variable x = (x_1, x_2), and y we maximize the MI by decomposing it as I(x_1, y) + I(x_2, y | x_1) etc.. This is an equality due to chain rule, and we propose to maximize each of the term in the decomposition, and we argue that we can have a tighter estimate to the total MI. Admittedly, that maximization does apply to lower-bounds of the quantities.\n\n**About the Variational Bound (I_VAR) and Importance Sampling (I_IS)**\n\n_\"estimating p(y|x'') in this way is extremely difficult and is almost like learning a decoder in that we have to learn how to generate full data examples. Though this is far from fatal in the context of the overall approach, it feels like if we are able to learn a good approximation for p(y|x''), we have already solved much of the challenge contrastive learning was trying to address in the first place\"_\n\nWe agree that estimating p(y|x\u2019\u2019) is costly but could be feasible (it would amount to train a Flow decoder for images, or autoregressive decoder for text, something we do in our dialogue experiments).

If we don\u2019t optimize the expectation term wrt \\tau (which is how our experiments were performed), then we are guaranteed to have the same optimal solution for I_CNCE, i.e. \\tau^* = p and E* = log p(y|x\u2019\u2019, x\u2019)/p(y|x\u2019\u2019).\n\n_\"I would suggest that the approach Eq (11) requires far more careful justification for it to be convincing\"_\n\nWe have expanded our results for I_IS showing that in the limit of K->inf, the sup_E converges to I(x\u2019, y | x\u2019\u2019). We also show that the value is obtained for the critic learnt by I_CNCE but without assuming knowledge of p(y | x\u2019\u2019). In the synthetic experiment, we benchmarked the amount of MI estimated by I_IS, and see that is competitive with the I_CNCE, which assumes access to p(y|x\u2019\u2019).", "title": "Strengthened theory and clarifications about experiments, 1/2"}, "qFQHST_wkTt": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "4TjMm4peOsB", "comment": "Thanks for your review. We\u2019ll try to clarify hereafter your questions as best as we can:\n\n**About info-restricted views**\n\nIn Figure 1, we specify that information restricted views can be obtained either by masking pixels in an image or by omitting past sentences in a dialogue for example. In our vision experiments, we ablate two ways of generating information restricted views (see Table of results). The first is by using \u201ccutout\u201d (e.g. masking out square pixel regions in an image), the second is by using \u201cmulti-crop\u201d (e.g. cropping aggressively an image and resizing to the original size). Both strategies entail a loss of information and therefore an \u201cinformation-restricted\u201d view. A description of this is in Paragraph 5.2. For our dialogue experiments, we consider the last sentence in the past of a dialogue as the information restricted view for the past in the dialogue. This can be found in Paragraph 5.3.\n\n**About IB & MINE**\n\nAlthough seemingly related, IB is orthogonal from the purpose of this paper: IB tries to minimize MI between X and latent representation Z while maximizing information between Z and labels Y. Therefore, usually it has been used in the context of supervised learning, where the goal is to regularize the model in order to exploit only the information necessary to solve the task. On the contrary, here we want to maximize MI between X and Z with the hope that imbuing Z with the most information about X can help a variety of downstream tasks (e.g. effective pretraining). MINE is a different way of maximizing MI between X and Z. Please refer to (Djelm et al.; 2019) https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06670 for a comparison between learning representations using MINE and InfoNCE (as is the case in our paper). Current SOTA self-supervised representation models use InfoNCE bounds (that have a low-variance) and therefore we build upon those bounds. Extending our results to MINE-type bound could be interesting future work\n\n**About \"views\" terminology**\n\nWe used y for the other example because in our setting we don\u2019t have any labels as we perform self-supervised learning. We can change the notation to another letter if you think it's clearer. What would you suggest? \u201cviews\u201d is a common word in self-supervised learning techniques, e.g. see CMC for example (https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05849), and slightly differs from data samples in such it is used to describe controllable transformations of data samples (such as rotation, color jittering for images for example).", "title": "On IB and MINE and clarifications"}, "1XrPa2N48P": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "iCKrjGObX_n", "comment": "Answers to the explicit questions below:\n\na) **About w_k**: We tried with and without stopping the gradient, the results were not significantly affected by this choice. Our theorem assumes the w_k are optimal, which would correspond to detaching the weights.\n\nb) **About bounds used in each task**: We didn\u2019t cherry pick how we maximize conditional MI for each task. Our justification for using the I_IS in the image setting and I_VAR in the dialogue setting is the following: as you pointed out, in the image setting using a variational q(y | x\u2019\u2019) would correspond to training an image decoder which could be feasible but is definitely expensive (one would have to sample K negative samples from a flow model for each x\u2019\u2019 in the batch\u2026). Given that InfoMin Aug. uses a large contrastive buffer of negative samples (65536), I_IS is definitely more suited in this setting and very cheap to implement. On the contrary, in the dialogue setting, encoding a lot of negative examples with GPT-2 is very expensive (as it requires a lot of forward passes through GPT-2 which is infeasible given our computational resources), while sampling examples from q(y | x\u2019\u2019) is cheap, due to the fact that we can use ancestral sampling to generate possible future continuations y given a restricted past x\u2019\u2019 in parallel and that sentences are in general short in the context of dialogue. If you agree, we\u2019ll write this justification in the paper, we\u2019re sorry we missed that explanation.\n\nc) **About lambda=0**: The result when setting lambda=0 is lower than the InfoMin Aug. baseline and thus than our model. We\u2019ll rerun this experiment and add the exact number to the final version of the paper. Our hypothesis is that this is due to a failure in sharing learning signals between the critics of conditional and unconditional MI. By maximizing I_NCE(x\u2019\u2019, y) + I_IS(x\u2019, y | x\u2019\u2019) w.r.t. the same encoder f, the representation z\u2019\u2019 = f(x\u2019\u2019) is trained with negative examples from the marginal, while z\u2019 = f(x\u2019) is trained with negative examples from p(y | x\u2019\u2019). But at linear evaluation time, the model is evaluated only using z\u2019 = f(x\u2019). Therefore, if the encoder is large enough, x\u2019 and x\u2019\u2019 are easily distinguishable by f and thus f can learn strikingly different feature spaces: z\u2019 could contain only \u201cglobal\u201d info useful to distinguish the image from samples p(y | x\u2019\u2019), while z\u2019\u2019 could contain only \u201clocal\u201d info useful to distinguish from samples p(y). By also maximizing the term I_NCE(x\u2019, y), we encourage f(x\u2019) to include also features useful to distinguish x\u2019 from negative examples p(y) in the corpus thus bringing z\u2019 = f(x\u2019) and z\u2019\u2019 = f(x\u2019\u2019) distributionally closer. We are happy to add this discussion to the paper if you feel it\u2019s relevant.\n\nd) **About error bars**: Each of the vision experiments take 6 days to run on our gpus. We agree that error bars would be better, but we followed the standard self-supervised representation learning evaluation where error bars are not provided (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05849, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09852.pdf ). We are willing to provide those but we would need more time to do so as we have to do it also for the baselines reported.\n\ne) **About lambda**: Yes, sorry, we followed the same experimental setting. Lambda is chosen on the validation set. We will add this to the final version.\n\nf) **About bootstrap**: We closely follow the protocol used in Zhang et al. 2019. Systems were paired and each response pair was presented to 3 judges in random order on a 3 point Likert scale. We use a majority vote for each response pair to decide whether system1, system2, or neither, performed better. We then bootstrap the set of majority votes to obtain a 95% confidence interval on the expected difference between system1 and system2. If this confidence interval contains 0, the difference is deemed insignificant. We also computed p-values via https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d2304.

Taking on the notation of the CorEx paper, our paper gives a way of maximizing terms such as I(x_i, z | x_j) or I(z_i, x | z_j) which seems outside of the scope of the CorEx paper which aims to maximize \\sum_i I(x_i, z) independently. In fact, it seems that CorEx encourages each x_i to be independently informative about z while minimizing the MI between x and z. This will have the effect of maximizing the MI between x and z under some independence assumptions that will have of course some effect on I(x_i, z | x_j), but to which extent is not totally clear to us.
