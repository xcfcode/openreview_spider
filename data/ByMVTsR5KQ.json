We still do not understand what specifically caused you to *change* your initial score of 6 to a 5. Respectfully, these criticisms appear to be post-hoc justification for your updated score. Nevertheless, we will address your concerns below, and have updated the paper with minor revisions based on your feedback:\n\n** Clarifying contributions **\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201cIf as said in the response, the concrete methodological contributions are phase shuffle (Section 3.3) and the learned post processing filters (Appendix B). At first reading of the paper, these contributions are not clear. These statements are not presented until Section 3.3 and Section 5 (EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL). In the Abstract and Introduction, it is said that the barrier to success application of GANs to audio generation is the non-invertible spectral representation. \u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nWhile we outlined additional methodological contributions (e.g. phase shuffle) in response to your initial review, our *primary* contribution is still a GAN that operates on raw audio waveforms. Before this paper, the ability of GANs to generate one dimensional time series data had not been demonstrated.\n\n** WaveGAN vs SpecGAN **\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201cThe non-invertible issue is not a issue.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nSimply put, the non-invertibility of SpecGAN *is* an issue. If you naively apply image GANs to audio generation (by operating on spectrograms i.e. SpecGAN), the non-invertibility of the spectrograms is a major barrier to downstream usability because the resultant audio quality is atrocious (see links below). While humans are able to label digits generated by SpecGAN with higher accuracy than those generated by WaveGAN, the human-assessed subjective sound quality of SpecGAN is worse (and a simple listening test confirms this).\n\nBy operating directly on waveforms, our WaveGAN method achieves higher audio quality, is simpler to implement, and is a first for generative modeling of audio using GANs.\n\nWaveGAN (recognizable and better audio quality): http://iclr-wavegan-results.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wavegan_sc09.wav\nSpecGAN with *approximate* inversion (recognizable but poor audio quality): http://iclr-wavegan-results.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/specgan_sc09.wav\n\n** Presentation of qualitative ratings **\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201cAround 60% accuracy for generated data is not a strong evidence that WaveGAN/SpecGAN as presented in this paper is promising. Thinking about generating digit images 0-9 by training GANs in MNIST. The labeling accuracy for generated images would be much higher than 60%.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nIt is unfair to compare our results to the hypothetical human labeling performance of digits generated by a GAN trained on MNIST. While MNIST may have the same number of semantics modes (10) as our SC09 digit dataset, these datasets are quite different in terms of dimensionality. Images in MNIST can be seen as vectors in 784-dimensional (28x28) space, whereas waveforms in SC09 are vectors in 16000-dimensional space. Higher dimensionality does not necessarily equate to greater difficulty to generative modeling, but it certainly should discourage direct comparison.\n\nWe argue that our results are indeed \u201cpromising\u201d. We developed and compared multiple methods for generating audio waveforms with GANs, a first for the field. Our results are analogous to early papers in image generation with GANs (e.g. DCGAN from ICLR 2016), and such results laid groundwork for remarkable breakthroughs in high-resolution image synthesis.\n\n** Clarifying inception scores **\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201cIf WaveGAN is what the paper introduces to overcome the non-invertible issue, it is confusing to see that SpecGAN outperforms WaveGAN by a large margin in Inception score. And I think, 58% accuracy for WaveGAN vs 66% for SpecGAN cannot be said to be similar. The non-invertible issue is not a issue.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nWhile many GAN papers use inception score as a primary evaluation metric, we state that our intention is to use human evaluations as our primary metric: \u201cWhile inception score is a useful metric for hyperparameter validation, our ultimate goal is to produce examples that are intelligible to humans. To this end, we measure the ability of human annotators...\u201d\n\nIn our updated manuscript, we additionally hypothesize a reason behind the discrepancy between inception scores and subjective quality assessments: \u201cthis discrepancy [between inception score and human assessments of quality] can likely be attributed to the fact that inception scores are computed on spectrograms while subjective quality assessments are made by humans listening to waveforms.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, while the focus of our paper is on WaveGAN as it is a non-trivial application of GANs to audio generation, we acknowledge that spectrogram-based methods also achieve reasonable results for our task despite audio quality issues: \u201cWe see promise in both waveform and spectrogram audio generation with GANs; our study does not suggest a decisive winner.\u201d", "title": "Author Response to Reviewer #3 (1/2)"}, "r1x7zyjOam": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "ByxwkkouTX", "comment": "\u201c\u201c\u201cPhase shuffle increases Inception scores substantially (4.12->4.67) in WaveGAN, but deteriorate Inception score in SpecGAN. And there is no discussion about this.\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nApplied to spectrograms, phase shuffle is a radically different operation than it is for waveform because spectrograms have more compact temporal axes, and we fill in jittered samples with padding. This means that, in the worst case, a SpecGAN discriminator with minimum phase shuffle (n=1) may be observing 468ms (nearly half the example) of padded waveform. On the other hand, a WaveGAN discriminator with n=1 observes a worst case of 83ms of padded waveform.\n\nWe have added a sentence to our paper: \u201cPhase shuffle decreased the inception score of SpecGAN, possibly because the operation has an exaggerated effect when applied to the compact temporal axis of spectrograms.\u201d", "title": "Author Response to Reviewer #3 (2/2)"}, "r1gFfA7GaX": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HkeNkp5xTQ", "comment": "Thank you for your feedback.

Specifically, we believe we have made concrete methodological contributions such as phase shuffle (Section 3.3) and the learned post processing filters (Appendix B). In particular, phase shuffle was observed to increase Inception scores substantially (4.1->4.7), and, to our ears, made the difference between spoken digits that were intelligible and those that were unintelligible.\n\nSpoken digits from WaveGAN **with** phase shuffle (more intelligible): http://iclr-wavegan-results.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/quant_wavegan_ps2.wav\nSpoken digits from WaveGAN **without** phase shuffle (less intelligible): http://iclr-wavegan-results.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/quant_wavegan.wav\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201c Qualitative ratings are poor. \u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nAs our task seeks to evaluate how well GANs can capture the semantic modes (vocabulary words in this case) of the training data, the primary qualitative metric to pay attention to should be the labeling accuracy. We believe our results of around 60% accuracy for generated data show that our approach is promising (note that random chance would be 10%).\n\nOn the subject of the qualitative ratings, our primary goal with this work is to provide a reasonable first pass at this problem, as well as define a task with clear and reproducible evaluation methodology to allow ourselves and others to iterate further. We believe our qualitative results are adequate, but note that improving these scores is a promising avenue for future work by integrating recent breakthroughs in image processing such as spectral normalization (Miyato et al. ICLR 2018) and progressive growth (Kerras et al.

We added the following sentence to our abstract \u201cWaveGAN is capable of synthesizing one second audio waveforms with temporal coherence, suitable for sound effect generation.\u201d We also added a similar clarification to paragraph 5 of the introduction (specifying that the generated waveforms are one second in length).\n\n** Justification for spectrogram pre-processing **\n\f\nWe added justification for our spectrogram preprocessing to the last paragraph of page 4.\n\n** Discussion of existing methods (e.g. WaveNet) **\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201cThe paper dismisses existing generative methods early in the evaluation phase \u2026 it would have been beneficial to discuss and understand the failures of existing methods in more detail to convince the reader that a fair attempt has been made to getting competitors to work before leaving them out entirely\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nWe had originally included some of these details in our paper but they were cut for brevity. We agree that we cut too much, and have added details back into the paper in the form of a new Appendix section (Appendix C) with a pointer from the main paper. A summary follows:\n\nHow autoregressive waveform models (e.g. WaveNet) factor into the story and evaluation of our paper is a tricky subject, and one that we tried to handle thoughtfully. First and foremost: *the two public implementations of WaveNet that we tried simply failed to produce reasonable results* (sound examples can be heard at the bottom of http://iclr-wavegan-results.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com ). We did informally pre-screen these results ourself (and you can as well) and concluded that they were clearly noncompetitive. We also calculated Inception scores for these experiments: they were 1.067 +- 0.045 and 1.293 +- 0.027 respectively.\n\nWe reasoned that including these (poor) numbers in our results table would send the wrong message to readers. Namely, it would appear that we are claiming our methods works better than WaveNet. *This is NOT a claim that we are attempting to make*, as WaveNet was developed for a different problem (text-to-speech) than the one we are focusing on (learning the semantics of short audio clips). WaveNet additionally has no concept of a latent space, which would not allow for the same steerable exploration of sound effects that our model aspires to achieve (outlined in the introduction). Furthermore, we expect that the proprietary implementation of WaveNet would produce something more reasonable for our spoken digits task, but unfortunately we do not have access to it.\n\n** User study clarification **\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201c It is unclear to me how many people annotated the individual samples? \u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nWe have 300 examples of each digit, resulting in 3000 total labeling problems (name the digit 1-10). We give these to 300 annotators in random batches of 10 examples, and ask for qualitative assessments at the end of each batch. Accordingly, we have 300 responses to each qualitative metric (quality, easy, diversity). Standard deviations for MOS scores are around 1 for each category, resulting in small standard errors (~0.06) for n=300. We have added the standard deviations to our paper table and updated the text in Section 6.3 to clarify these details.\n\n\u201c\u201c\u201c Consider including a reflection on (or perhaps even test statistically) the alignment between the qualitative diversity/quality scores and the subjective ratings to justify the use of the objective scores in the training/selection process \u201d\u201d\u201d\n\nThe evaluation of generative models is a fraught topic and the lack of correlation between quantitative and qualitative metrics is known (see \u201cA note on the evaluation of generative models\u201d Theis et al. ICLR 2016). In the scope of our work, we do not have enough data points (only three for the expensive Mechanical Turk evaluations) to reach substantive conclusions about the correlation between e.g. Inception score and mean opinion scores for quality.\n\nWe hypothesize that the discrepancy between our quantitative metrics (Inception score, nearest neighbor comparisons) and subjective metrics (MOS scores) is due to the fact that the former are computed from spectrograms while the latter are from humans listening to waveforms. Unfortunately, evaluation of Inception score in the waveform domain was impractical as we were unable to train a waveform domain classifier that achieved reasonable accuracy on this classification task (note that we mention in our abstract that audio classifiers usually operate on spectrograms). However, we have updated our discussion to clarify: \u201cThis discrepancy can likely be attributed to the fact that inception scores are computed on spectrograms while subjective quality assessments are made by humans listening to waveforms.\u201d", "title": "Author Response to Reviewer #1"}, "BJxnO07zTQ": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "S1lL5vpRhm", "comment": "Thank you for highlighting that our experimental results are promising.

Our model is already capable of producing convincing results on this task for several different sound domains. Furthermore, whereas the goals for text to speech are to synthesize a given transcript, we are providing a method which enables user-driven content generation through exploration of a compact latent space of sound effects.\n\nOur purpose for focusing our evaluation on a speech generation task is to enable straightforward annotating for humans on Mechanical Turk.
