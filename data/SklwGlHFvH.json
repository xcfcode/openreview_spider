Here we extend a known field-theory formalism for GP inference to get a detailed understanding of learning-curves in DNNs trained in the regime of this correspondence (NTK regime). In particular, a renormalization-group approach is used to show that noiseless GP inference using NTK, which lacks a good analytical handle, can be well approximated by noisy GP inference on a related kernel we call the renormalized NTK. Following this, a perturbation-theory analysis is carried in one over the dataset-size yielding analytical expressions for the (fixed-teacher/fixed-target) leading and sub-leading asymptotics of the learning curves. At least for uniform datasets, a coherent picture emerges wherein fully-connected DNNs have a strong implicit bias towards functions which are low order polynomials of the input.

Experiments showed that the sub-leading approximation formula approximates the generalization error well when $n$ is large. \n\n\nThis paper is poorly written. Many mathematic notations and terminologies are not well-defined. The setup of the experiments are not given clearly. Here I gave some examples: \n1) The authors claimed that they derived two approximation formulas, EK and SL. I didn't find a clear statement in the main text saying which formula is the EK approximation and which formula is the SL approximation. My conjecture is that, Eq. (10) gives the EK formula, and SL formula is not given in the main text. In addition, Eq. (10) is confusing because the authors wrote that Eq. (10) is a simplification of Eq. (8). However, Eq. (8) was an approximate equality, then Eq. (10) turned into an equality. \n2) Figure 1 gives experimental results. However, the description of the experimental setup is completely vague. The authors described the kernel and the target function as \"the NTK kernel implied by a fully connected network of depth 4 with $\u03c3_w^2 = \u03c3_b^2 = 1$ and ReLU activations\" and \"a target function with equal spectral weights at $l = 1, 2$\", without other explanations. I don't think readers can figure out what is exactly the kernel and the target function from this description. \n3) I am concerned about the writing style of this paper. I am OK with the physics jargon the authors used in the paper, as well as the non-rigorous of the result. But I think the authors should write equations in a clear way. For example, the definition of renormalized NTK should better be defined in equations such as $K_r(x, x') = \\sum_{k = 0}^r b_k <x, x'>^k$, rather than be described in words like \"trim after the r\u2019th power\". \n\n\nHere is a technical question: \n- It seems that the authors claimed that both EK and SL give approximation error O(1/N^3). Then why SL is the \"sub-leading asymptotics\"? \n\n\nI feel the content of the paper is somewhat interesting. However, the paper is poorly written. The authors failed to deliver effective scientific communication to the readers. The results cannot be reproduced after reading this paper. Therefore, I would give a clear reject. \n\n\n---------\nAfter reading the response and the revised paper: \n\nI found that the authors modified and improved their manuscript a lot. They made much effort to address the issues I raised. This is why I think I can potentially raise my score to a weak rejection. \n\nHowever, the modifications made by the authors are still not sufficient. For example, I asked the authors in my review to clarify what is the target function for the experiments. The authors now write in the paper \"We consider input data in dimension d = 50 and a scalar target function $g(x) = \\sum_{l=1,2;m} g_{lm}Y_{lm}(x)$ such that $\\sum_{l=1, m} g_{lm}^2 = \\sum_{l=2, m} g_{lm}^2 = 1/2$, but otherwise iid $g_{lm}$\u2019s.\" I believe that a (random) target function that satisfies all these conditions doesn't exists. I guess what the authors want to say is something like \"taking $g(x) = \\sum_{l=1, 2} \\sum_{m = 1}^{M_l} g_{lm}Y_{lm}(x)$, $(g_{11}, ..., g_{1 M_1}) \\sim Unif(S^{M_1 - 1}(1/\\sqrt 2))$, and $(g_{21}, ..., g_{2 M_2}) \\sim Unif(S^{M_2 - 1}(1/\\sqrt 2))$\". The problem of the statement of the authors is that, if $\\sum_{m=1}^{M_1} g_{1m}^2 =\\sum_{m = 1}^{M_2} g_{2m}^2 = 1/2$, $(g_{lm})_{l = 1, 2; m \\in \\{1, \\ldots, M_l \\}}$ cannot be i.i.d. (one choice is to make $g_{11} = ... = g_{1M_1} = \\sqrt{1/(2 M_1)}$ and $g_{21} = ... = g_{2 M_2} = \\sqrt{1/(2 M_2)}$ be deterministic, but they are unequal). This is just an example of the writing problem of the paper. There are many other issues. \n\nI doubt this paper can be easily accepted at a Physics venue. I used physics tools like replica methods and I knew some Physicists published in machine learning conferences. The papers these Physicists wrote deliver clear scientific communications, though also using jargons and non-rigorous tools. There are many papers using physics tools studying machine learning problems, which published at ML conferences like ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS. This paper is far less as accessible as those papers. \n\nFinally, I want to point out that, the generalization of kernel methods have been intensively studied in the machine learning literature, for example using the RKHS theory. It would be nice to cite related literature and compare the results. It is my fault that I didn't bring this point up in my review. \n\nI agree that there could potentially be great ideas in this paper. The conference is a venue with quality control. I encourage the authors to submit this paper again after they make more efforts to improve its accessibility.

In appendix D, it is mentioned that you need averaging over about 10 samples to have a decent average. For a single realization of a N-sized training set, there is additional variation (Adding or subtracting to the error epsilon).  Given actual experiments are typically performed for a single realization of the data, I think this point should be mentioned in the main text more explicitly. Ideally, you could add error bars to the data, accounting for the dispersion inherent to a single-realization case.\n\nA. The error bars would be of the order of 0.001\\% and completely invisible in our graph. The reason is that while we only take 10~ samples per dataset size (and consequently the dataset averaged generalization error does have a noticeable 5\\% relative error), we also perform the Poisson averaging over many datasets of similar size. This greatly suppresses the errors. We now address this point explicitly in Sec 6 (in addition to demonstrating it in appendix A).\n\nR.

When preparing the original manuscript we tediously went through all these cited results as explained in the prior works section. The main issue is that very few treat the noiseless case beyond one dimension and two dimensional settings. The one work we know which makes predictions at higher dimension (Sollich (2001)) works in the teacher-averaged predictions (rather than fixed teacher), makes assumptions on some level of matching between the teacher-prior and the GP-prior, and doesn't lead to explicit expression. \n\nR. \u2018\u2018The $d^{-l}$ scaling of eigenvalues\u2019\u2019 : at this point, the variable \u2018l\u2019 had not been defined.\n\nA.

I would have expected this kind of quantity to decrease with N.\n\nA. As is explained more clearly in Sec. 5. While the off-diagonal terms are small there are more and more of them as the the dataset size increases (and hence the size of the matrix K(D)). Collecting all these omitted contributions to the prediction, they would appear, roughly, as a random matrix multiplying the target vector in Eq. (1). Therefore they would sum together (incoherently/with-alternating-signs) and give an error which increases with $N$. A different view point is that the large one takes $N$ the finer the features ones can resolve, and hence neglecting the high angular momentum spherical Harmonics becomes less and less adequate.  \n\nR.

We have improved our results list, disentangled the derivations from the results (see for instance sub-section 3.3). Regarding fix-teacher versus average, we agree with the referee on the technical point however note that fix-teacher learning curves are typically harder to obtain compared to ones derived from say a different Gaussian prior. More specifically it is very easy now to take our expressions for the MSE error and average them over any teacher prior for which $\\langle g_n g_m \\rangle_{Teachers}$ in known. This is because $g$ appears linearly in all of our predictions.   R.

On that point I am a bit lost and it\u2019s a pity because your results are strong and rely on few, rather simple/elegant assumptions (which call for some intuitive understanding).\n\nA. We perfectly agree with referee's geometric interpretation. Section 5. now contains a paragraph discussing the intuition behind our renormalizaiton group approach. \n\nR. Could you explain intuitively, to the inexperienced reader, why the noiseless case is harder to deal with than the finite-noise one ?\n\nA. Such an intuition now appears in the text, below Eq. (4).

It is unfortunate that we couldn't communicate it better. However the reviewer may get a sense from the other referees' views, that there is a unique result \"hidden\" in this text. This result required much analytical effort and several novel ideas (such as the renormalized NTK). Indeed it is often said that deep neural networks are a black-box whereas, in this fairly complicated setting, we understand almost exactly what they are doing using only pen and paper. The bigger promise here is that field-theory can deliver a concrete, detailed, and accurate formalism for reasoning about DNNs. The notion of adding noise to a GP by trimming its Taylor expansion may also resonate with a wider audience. \n\nRegarding presentation, we concede that the delivery of many parts was sub-optimal and emphasized techniques over results. In addition more attention should have been placed on making the definitions clearer. We have therefore made various changes to the presentation: We emphasize the results over the tools whenever appropriate and clarify all definitions. We also compartmentalized the field-theory section to a particular sub-section which can be skipped without compromising the overall message.  \nA more persistent hurdle in effectively communicating our results, is that we use physics tools and methodologies: We make reasonable assumptions which lead to experimentally verifiable/falsifiable theoretical predictions which we then proceed to test. We also use tools like field-theory, which have no axiomatic basis, because past experience in particle physics convinced us that they perform well and similarly important - that they are insightful.

One can see that the ($g^{\\star}_{EK,\\eta}-g$) (the error in the EK results) has a leading power of $O(1/N)$, whereas the $SL$ term has a leading power of $O(1/N^2)$.", "title": "Review Response"}, "r1eXnS1RKH": {"type": "review", "replyto": "SklwGlHFvH", "review": "This paper explores how tools from perturbative field theory can be used to shed light on properties of the generalization error of Gaussian process/kernel regression, particularly on how the error depends on the number of samples N.
