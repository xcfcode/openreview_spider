I am still in favor of the idea -- applying simple, old-school method into a new problem, and I also agree with R1 and R2 that the paper is currently lack of details and experimental results. I will keep my score, but would not fight for the acceptance if R1 and R2 insist.\n----------------------------------------\nSummary\nThis paper presents a new method for 3D shape reconstruction, based on SDF (Signed Distance Function) and PCA. The basic idea is to conduct PCA on all the shapes with SDF as feature, and encode a shape by the eigenvectors from PCA. The authors present experiments on 3D reconstruction from 2D view and point clouds, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. I lean to vote for accepting this paper since the idea is simple but novel, and it achieves good performance.\nStrengths\n- The idea itself is simple and novel. The basic idea of this approach is simple -- keep most information / variance by using PCA, and it is also very novel, since I have not seen papers using PCA to encode 3D shapes.\n- The idea is effective. As the authors demonstrated in section 4, this approach works well, and it outperforms all other methods by a large margin according to Chamfer distance. This is impressive since such a simple method can improve the performance this much.\nWeaknesses\n- More analysis could be provided about how do the authors choose SDF. Choosing SDF here is obviously a reasonable choice, but is it the best? More analysis could be provided, or more experiments could be included.\nPossible Improvements\nAs mentioned above, more analysis about why choosing SDF or more experiments about comparing SDF to other representations under this PCA approach could be provided.", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 3}, "r1lKDzEtjS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJgjGxrFPS", "comment": "Dear Reviewers, Thank you for your comments that help us to revise the manuscript.

Equation (2) refers to the chamfer loss, which we emphasize is only used in our models denoted eigenSDF (finetuned). Typically we just minimize the loss in the latent space of the PCA. \n\n\"In general, I find it's a bit hard to follow when only 2-3 paragraphs are used for describing the proposed approach.

However the concept of proposed eigenSDF is simple: we learn a PCA model for the shape using the SDF representation, obtaining a simple latent shape representation. For downstream tasks (e.g. 2D image -> 3D shape) we simply minimize the MSE in the latent space, saving completely the decoding step during training, and having a very light decoder for inference. \n\nWe can also finetune this entire model using the chamfer loss applied at the level of the SDF representation, but note even without this performance is already competitive.  \n\nWe do emphasize this high level view in several places besides the more formal Section 3 (e.g. in the introduction and in Fig 1).\n\n\"Regarding experimental results, (...).

We want to note that Occupancy networks were explicitly trained for the IoU. On the other hand Chamfer distance is a much better metric for this task as mentioned in [1] and [2].\n\nWe also want to note that single instance where LinearSDF is better than EigenSDF was actually due to a typographical error from transferring numbers to the table. This was only for chamfer distance and rifle category. Note that for rifles, the IoU and Normal Consistency measures were better for EigenSDF. We have now fixed this. \n\n\"A few failure case...  of the proposed approach.\"\n\nOne of the issues can be seen when looking at the quantitative table: similar to 3D-R2N2 or Deep Level Sets, eigenSDF is struggling with reconstructing thin objects such as examples from lamp category.\n\nA possible improvement can be the following:\n    1) pre-processing SDFs by adding a small epsilon to make the SDFs \u201cfatter\u201d\n    2) Training eigenSDF to learn \u201cfat\u201d version of examples\n    3) Switch the L2 loss to chamfer loss and the ground truth to original, thin examples.\n\nNote that levelset methods are often susceptible to good initialization procedure.\n\n\"Compare against DeepSDF\"\n\nFirst of all we want to emphasize one of the goals of our work is to show a simple (linear) baseline can be competitive to the current state-of-the-art methods on the standard tasks. Indeed DeepSDF is an interesting and related work. As discussed in the Introduction DeepSDF avoids discretization but can lead to a complex decoder model, for example an 8 layer network is used to fit the SDF.  In our case the representation is given by a simple linear transformation.  Note DeepSDF does not give a task agnostic latent variable model as in our case (aka to represent a specific shape you need to fit a separate deep NN for each shape or do it implicitly conditioned on an image for a given task). In our formulation the shape representation has an explicit small latent code and this thus allows us to perform training in latent space. We also note DeepSDF subsamples 16384 SDF  points. In our case, we capture over 99% of variance of over 2 million points. We noted that the dataset and preprocessing used in DeepSDF is different than in our work and the others we compare to thus it is difficult for us to compare at this time.  Specifically to use SDFs we need watertight meshes. \n\n[1] Sun, Xingyuan, et al. \"Pix3d: Dataset and methods for single-image 3d shape modeling.\" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2018.\n[2] Tatarchenko, Maxim, et al. \"What Do Single-view 3D Reconstruction Networks Learn?.\" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019.\n[3] Michalkiewicz, Mateusz, et al. \"Deep Level Sets: Implicit Surface Representations for 3D Shape Inference.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.06802 (2019).", "title": "Response to review #1"}, "SkgVc1NFsH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B1lQSgTfcS", "comment": "Thank you for your review. \n\nRegarding the motivation of the PCA + SDF.  The goal of our paper was to determine if a simple latent variable model can be used to replace the typically complex decoder. PCA seems a natural choice for this however the representation it is applied to is less obvious. As noted in [1], and in many other papers, there are currently 4 main shape representations: voxels, SDFs, point clouds and meshes. Applying the PCA to voxels is somewhat inappropriate, they are binary while PCA is designed for continuous variables. We do however evaluate this now in Appendix A2, where we show 3D reconstruction with 2048 eigenvectors for a random example of ShapeNetCars using voxel-based representation and SDFs. Voxel-based reconstructions perform so poorly that we did not even consider them for quantitative evaluation.\n\nApplying PCA to point clouds and meshes is not evident. Point clouds do not have a natural ordering thus it is unclear how one can apply it here. Similarly meshes do not have any canonical representation that can be used to represent them.  We have added this discussion to Appendix A2.\n\n[1] Michalkiewicz, Mateusz, et al. \"Deep Level Sets: Implicit Surface Representations for 3D Shape Inference.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.06802 (2019).", "title": "Response to review #3"}, "HkgKmkEKir": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJe5U-qh9r", "comment": "Thank you for your review. \n\n\u201cBeing able to easily scale to higher resolutions is claimed to be one of the main advantages, but I am not convinced that this is useful under this setting. If I understand this correctly, the number of eigenvectors k is fixed, and projecting the SDF field to this space would remove the higher frequency components of the shape. So wouldn't the number of eigenvectors be the bottleneck in representational precision, not the resolution of the output space?\u201d\n\nFirst of all we want to highlight that the number of eigenvectors k needed to capture the data variance are very small relative to the larger resolutions we consider. For example in our experiments with 128^3 resolution  k= 2048 for category ShapeNet-cars.  Plot of captured variance of category ShapeNet-cars for resolution 128^3 can be found in the new version in Appendix A1. \n\nSecondly, we emphasize that the reason the proposal is scalable is that it avoid having a 3D convolutional decoder which will be by construction much slower than just predicting k coefficients, even if k were big in practice, which it isn\u2019t.  \n\n\"What is the chosen k (number of eigenvectors)? It says k was \"chosen to capture 99.5% of the variance within the dataset\", but I could not find how exactly it was chosen and what value of k was used (I apologize if I missed).\"\n\nThe chosen number of eigenvectors ranged from 512 to 2048. Some ShapeNet categories have small number of examples (such as phone, watercraft, or bench - approximately 1 000 examples) while others are substantially bigger (table, car, chair  - close to 8 000 examples). We have added more details regarding this in Appendix A1.\n\n\n\"Also, I think the PCA is category-specific (page 4, section 4.1). Is k dependent on the category or is it the same across all categories?\"\n\nYes, as mentioned before, since ShapeNet categories differ in size (from ~1k phones to ~8k cars), our choice for number of eigenvectors differs as well.\n\n\"Some of the other methods (if not all) used for comparison are not category-specific, so if this is true, I think the comparison may not be entirely fair and it should be made clearer.\"\n\nAmong methods in Section 4.1, only 3D R2N2 explicitly train their network  jointly on all categories. However, our framework can be trivially generalized to a category-agnostic one. The only modification would be a larger number of eigenvectors. \n\nIn Section 4.4, all methods were trained per category.\n\n\"Minor typos\"\n\nThank you for noting the typos we have corrected them in the manuscript.\n\n\"Figure 2 not referred in the main text.\"\n\nIt is referred in the main text as \u201cFigure 4.3\u201d, this was latex referencing error and we have now corrected it.
