Similar to the existing works on \u201creinforcement learning (RL) with demonstration\u201d such as DQfD, DDPGfD, policy optimization with demonstration (POfD) [2], hard exploration conditions (sparse reward, partial observability, high variance in initial states) are assumed, which is difficult to achieve good performance with RL without demonstration in general. Eight tasks in such conditions were devised and used to test the performance of R2D3.\n\nI like the fact that the authors of this work have chosen quite challenging scenarios, but I think the novelty of this submission is a bit weak to be accepted to the conference. I believe \u201cRL with demonstration\u201d becomes meaningful when it beats both RL and IL in some reasonable setting. For example, POfD [2] assumes sparse-reward tasks with *imperfect* demonstrations, which is difficult to achieve good performance by using RL or IL. From such a perspective, I have the following concerns:\n\n- Imitation learning baselines: There has been recent advancement in imitation learning. In the submission, it was mentioned that \u201cGAIL has never been successfully applied to complex partially observable environments that require memory\u201d, but there\u2019s [3] that successfully uses GAIL in such a setting. Also, off-policy imitation learning such as DAC [4] is shown to be highly sample-efficient compared to GAIL in MuJoCo domain. However, the submission only considers behavioral cloning (BC) (which shows poor performance at unseen states due to the covariate shift problem) as a baseline among imitation learning method\n\n- Reinforcement learning baselines: The submission adopted R2D2 as an RL baseline, and it seems to me that the R2D2 agent starts from random initialization. For a fair comparison, however, I believe R2D2 with BC (or Batch RL) initialization should be considered.\n\nIn addition to the above concerns, it seems to me that most of the features in R2D3 simply combines those in either DQfD or R2D2, and I couldn\u2019t find out its own algorithmic novelty except \u201cdemo ratio\u201d parameter. \n\nI\u2019ll increase my score if I made wrong comments or misunderstood the contribution.\n\nReferences\n[1] Kapturowski, Ostrovski, Quan, Munos. and Dabney, \u201cRecurrent experience replay in distributed reinforcement learning,\u201d ICLR 2019.\n[2] Kang, Jie, Feng, \u201cPolicy optimization with demonstrations,\u201d ICML 2018\n[3] Gangwani, Lehman, Liu, Peng, \u201cLearning Belief Representations for Imitation Learning in POMDPs,\u201d UAI 2019\n[4] Kostrikov, Agrawal, Dwibedi, Levine, Jonathan, Tompson, \u201cDiscriminator-Actor-Critic: Addressing Sample Inefficiency and Reward Bias in Adversarial Imitation Learning,\u201d ICLR 2019", "title": "Official Blind Review #4", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 3}, "rkeHw5y9or": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SygKyeHKDH", "comment": "We would like to thank all the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and feedback.

These methods are very powerful, but we did not try them because there is a strong evidence in the literature that standard versions of these algorithms do not work in the following settings: 1) POMDPs [a], 2) from pixels [b, c], 3) off policy [d] and 4) with variable initial conditions [e]. Our setting combines all of these. Each IL by IRL extension cited above is nontrivial and combining them may present challenges which are beyond the scope of this work.\n\nWe are hoping that our release of the Hard-Eight tasks will enable other researchers to try IL by IRL on more complicated tasks.\n\n[a] Learning Belief Representations for Imitation Learning in POMDPs. 2019.\n[b] InfoGAIL: Interpretable Imitation Learning from Visual Demonstrations. 2017.\n[c] Visual Imitation with a Minimal Adversary. 2018.\n[d] Discriminator-Actor-Critic: Addressing Sample Inefficiency and Reward Bias in Adversarial Imitation Learning. 2019.\n[e] Task-Relevant Adversarial Imitation Learning. 2019.\n\n>  The demo-ratio seems to be the key parameter to make this approach work (and the performance is proven very sensitive to its value). Instead of keeping it fixed across the entire learning process, have you tried to start with a high value and then decay according to a proper schedule? Intuitively, I would expect the benefits of expert demonstrations to be more valuable during the first learning episodes (where they make the agent explore better) and less during the successive phases (where the policy gets closer and closer to optimal).\n\nWe agree with this proposal, annealing the demo ratio can be an interesting experiment to try. Our experiments are already compute intensive and doing hyperparameter search for the annealing hyperparameters would require even more compute. As a result, we decided to just fix the demo-ratio throughout the training. As a future work, it would be interesting to evaluate different annealing methods with R2D3.\n\n> The way recurrent states are handled with zero-initialization is probably one of the limitations and seems to play an important role in some experiments. Have you tried, at least in simpler domains, to replay whole episodes and see whether that helps?\n\nGood point. We have tried two variations: 1) replaying the whole episode as you described, and 2) using stale lstm states as described in R2D2. Both of these variations seem to help to some extent on the the hardest memory task, remember sensor [a], but they do not help on the other tasks. We didn't focus on these variations because they introduce additional complexity [b] and do not change performance on most tasks.\n\n[a] the agent seems more reward, but still fails to solve the task 100% of the time\n[b] 1) multi-gpu training to allow for full unrolls over the whole episode while still maintaining large batch size, and 2) additional \"demo\" actors that pulled the current policy parameters and used them to calculate relatively fresh lstm states on the demonstrations.\n", "title": "Reply to Official Review #2"}, "Skgbqt19ir": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HkgqZVuaYS", "comment": "> What would be the present-day approximate retail cost for reproducing the experiments in this paper?\n\nWe used 256 actors and a single GPU learner. We trained R2D3 approximately for a week on each Hard-Eight task. Based on the numbers provided in Figure 8 of [a] ($0.0475 per cpu per hour, 1.46 per GPU per hour), training R2D3 on a single Hard-Eight task would cost 2288.16 USD. \n\n[a] Seed RL: Scalable and Efficient Deep-RL with Accelerated Central Inference\n\n> At the action-rate experienced by the human demonstrators (30fps?), how much wall-clock time represented by actor steps? (40 years?) Is this \"making efficient use\"?\n\nYes, it would take approximately 64 years. In our problem setting, one can consider efficiency with respect to demonstrations and/or environment interactions. We claim that our method can make efficient use of demonstrations but at the cost of a large number of interactions with the environment. However, we still need significantly fewer interactions with the environment than pure RL approaches which have seen no reward in the same 64 year period.\n\nWe are hopeful advances in off-policy RL and model based RL will improve the interaction efficiency of RL from demonstrations in the future.\n\n> Does having highly variable initial conditions really force generalization over environmental configurations or is this wishful thinking / mysticism? To make a direct claim about this, the authors should consider an experimental design where certain classes of initial conditions (e.g. starting on the left side of the map) are withheld during training and evaluated only during testing.\n\nSorry for any confusion. There are two types of generalization we can discuss in this setting: Type 1) generalizing from a small number of demonstrations to all initial conditions in the training task and Type 2) generalizing from initial conditions in the training tasks to the initial conditions in a hold out tasks. Type 1, which is not commonly considered, is the type of generalization we are focused on in this work. We agree that Type 2 is quite interesting but we haven't tested it thoroughly in this work.\n\n> The finding of small demo ratios as being stronger is exciting, but this result seems to be tied to the specific quantity and quality of demonstrations gathered. Could a more general picture of the role of demonstrations be had by ablating the diversity of representations? The 100 demos in the full case might be degraded to 50, 25, 10, etc while holding the demo ratio fixed. This might effectively vary the weight that demonstrations take in the optimization independently of how often distinct demos are actually seen.\n\nThis is a good suggestion. We considered this experiment but it is fairly compute intensive to run this. We ran some preliminary experiments on one of the easier tasks (drawbridge), where we varied the number of demonstrations and R2D3 managed to solve drawbridge even with 20 demos. We did not vary the demo ratio (fixed to 1/256), or try the other tasks.\n\nIf you think these experiments would be valuable to include, we can include them in the final version of the paper.\n\n> Can these hard-eight scenarios be parametrically scaled up and down in terms of their exploration effort (possibly by just changing the action granularity / movement speed)? With performance on the new benchmark almost saturated in the first paper based on it, there isn't much room to grow here. In the same way that Montezuma's Revenge was found by scanning the culturally-impactful library of Atari games, perhaps more appropriate and lasting challenges can be found by looking one or more generations forward in the history of commercial console games. Can we play Star Fox? What about SimCity?\n\nRegarding scaling exploration difficulty: Yes the levels could be modified in simple ways to make them more difficult. The action repeats or speed as you suggested, or by modifying the levels for example by making the rooms larger. Thanks for the suggestion, we may do this when we release the environments.\n\nRegarding saturating performance: R2D3 achieves the max possible reward for 5 tasks out of 8. However, there are still three tasks that are not completely solved yet. In addition, as was previously noted, these tasks are quite compute / exploration intensive to solve. We believe that the Hard-Eight tasks can be an interesting domain to improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. It is also an interesting domain for improved exploration methods.\n\nRegarding lasting challenges: It is quite interesting to use commercial games as a benchmark to test agents. We are aware of the efforts on Starcraft 2, DOTA, and others. However, those games can be even more compute intensive to run. The Hard-Eight tasks present a middle-ground between the current RL benchmark environments and commercial games in terms of compute required to solve with the existing algorithms and difficulty.\n", "title": "Reply to Official Review #3"}, "Bkx4SKkqsH": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJl2wiVt9S", "comment": "> (Novelty related concerns) \u2026 I like the fact that the authors of this work have chosen quite challenging scenarios, but I think the novelty of this submission is a bit weak to be accepted to the conference.\n\nWe understand that this work can be seen as incremental from the algorithmic point of view. In that sense, we showed that it is possible to achieve significant improvements on hard tasks with a novel combination of well-known techniques. We believe that this fits well with the acceptance criteria for ICLR. The reviewer guidelines suggests that papers that present SOTA results on well-studied problems should be given consideration, if they address problems that are of interest to the community.\n\nWe believe that our work is interesting to the community, because it shows that these challenging tasks can be solved with only a small number of demonstrations.\n\n> (Concern on the imperfect demos) ... For example, POfD [2] assumes sparse-reward tasks with *imperfect* demonstrations, which is difficult to achieve good performance by using RL or IL. \n\nAgreed, RL with demos is very interesting in the imperfect demo setting. Our work also falls into this setting (see the average reward of the demonstrations in Table 1). We clearly demonstrate that RL from demonstrations has beaten both RL and IL in this setting.

We would like to point out that standard GAIL does not work in the following settings: 1) POMDPs [3], 2) from pixels [a, b], 3) off policy [4] and 4) with variable initial conditions [c]. Let us note that [3] only addresses partially observable environments for GAILs. Our setting combines all of these.
