Considering the expressive power from the concept of universal representations, the authors introduced the concept of separability and combine the separable representation with MLP to achieve the universal representation for graphs. They then developed a coloring scheme to improve the MPNN, and obtained superior performance on benchmark graph classification datasets as well as in the graph property testing experiments. In general, I like the paper, but I have the following concerns:\n\nAlthough we can easily get the idea that universal representation is more expressive, however, I did feel a small conceptual gap between isomorphism test and universal representation. For example, in Section 4.2, when the authors talked about the fact that MPNN is not expressive to construct isomorphism tests for a k-regular graph, it is expected to have a more explicit explanation of how universal representations can solve this and how it is connected to isomorphism test. It seems that there is no such explanation in the paper. \n\nI am not very clear about how 1-CLIP gets the randomness. To my understanding, 1-CLIP uses one color, so the identical node attributes still have the same node attributes after coloring, and it is essentially equivalent to just concatenating extra node features to an MPNN? It also does not change the expressive power of MPNN.\n\nIntuitively k-CLIP should be better than p-CLIP if k>p, and it is also demonstrated in the graph property testing experiment. However, why do the authors use k as a hyperparameter to select the best results in classical benchmark datasets? Does it say sometimes the smaller k can also get a better result? Why not also just show the results of 1-CLIP and 16-CLIP?\n\nIt seems $k$ has different meanings in different places of the paper. For example, $k$ in $C_k$ is different the $k$ in Eq. (4). Maybe it is better to use a different variable to avoid confusion.\n", "title": "Official Blind Review #3", "rating": "6: Weak Accept", "confidence": 3}, "SygeSfGuoB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJxt0JHKvS", "comment": "Dear reviewers, as discussed in our answers to your comments, we have updated the submission with the following main changes:\n\n1.

We will update the paper in the next few days to address your concerns.\n\n1. In this work, we aim to give a complete and thorough study of universality in the context of GNNs. Hence the theoretical framework that allows a precise definition of CLIP is needed, also for pedagogical reasons. However, in the coming revised version we will give a better balanced version between the generalities and the clear description of our proposed algorithm. \n\n2. There are 3 steps in order to compute the graph representation from the node representations. Firstly, for each color $c$ among the $k$ colorings of the graph we compute a color dependent graph representation (which correspond to the sums, given $c$, in Eq. (5)). Secondly, to be color independent, we compute a vector from the $k$ previous ones by taking the coefficient-wise maximum among them. Finally, we use an MLP $\\psi$ that outputs the final graph representation $x_G$. We will make that clearer in the paper.\nConcerning your second remark, indeed, as you correctly understood when $k=1$, the max operator becomes an identity and we append a random coloring to the node attributes vector. That does not mean that we add a random color to every node attribute, but that we assign only once a different color randomly for the nodes with identical attributes.\n\n3. We apologies for the strong claim of novelty in Section 6, and agree that most of the ideas of NeighborNet are already present in the literature. We thus decided to replace this section by a comment in Section 5 that shows that the universality of this known architecture for permutation invariant sets is a straightforward consequence of Corollary 1.\nConcerning your second comment, $\\psi(x,y)$ indeed stands for the application of the function $\\psi$ to the concatenation of $x$ and $y$.\n\n4. We only kept one of the state of the art MPNN variants which is Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) [2]. It has superior performance among other standard variants of MPNNs.\nLooking at the experiments, the large variances are not specific to our algorithm. However, our algorithm is the only one consistent across all datasets and, contrary to GIN, we are statistically better than WL on 2 out of 3 datasets (none for the state of the art MPNN can achieve this).\n\n5. Thank you very much for pointing out this missing reference we were not aware of (it will be published at NeurIPS 2019). This work shares some similarities with ours and we are definitely going to cite and discuss it in our article.\nThey introduce Ring-GNN wich is an equivariant neural network method based on [3]. While Ring-GNN has more expressive power than WL-1, one cannot make it straightforwardly a universal GNN.\nNote that CLIP also only uses 2-tensors (and inf-CLIP reaches universality).\n\nWe will add the benchmark on Circular Skip Links to compare with our method as it is done in [4,5]. Looking at their reported experiments, early results show that CLIP significantly outperforms both RP-GIN and Ring-GNN. We will introduce this benchmark in the soon revised version of our paper.\n\n6. k-CLIP has universal representation theoretically for k large enough. In section 5.3 we give a precise bound.\n\n7. Thank you very much for pointing out these unclear notations.\nIndeed in 5.1 there may be some confusion as we first use 'c' in an example before using it more generally in Eq. (4). The chosen set of color $C = \\{c_1, ..., c_n\\}$ is ordered in all possible ways for the purpose of CLIP as stated in Eq. (4).\nIn Eq. (8), $x$ is a vector and S a set of vectors. In the case of CLIP, x will be a feature vector of a node and S the set of feature vectors of its neighbors.\n\n[2] How powerful are graph neural networks, Xu et al., ICLR 2019, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00826.pdf\n[3] Invariant and Equivariant Graph Networks, Haggai Maron, Heli Ben-Hamu, Nadav Shamir, Yaron Lipman, ICLR 2019, https://openreview.net/forum?id=Syx72jC9tm\n[4] Chen, Z., Villar, S., Chen, L. and Bruna, J., 2019.

We will update the paper in the next few days to address your concerns.\n\n1. The universal representation and isomorphism problem are indeed closely related (Reviewer #1 pointed out [1] which may be of interest for you). More precisely, as stated in Proposition 1, a universal representation of a graph G is able to separate points in the domain space (here a space of graphs). K-regular graphs are a simple example of a class of graphs that cannot be distinguished using classical MPNNs (there are many non-isomorphic k-regular graphs, see e.g. [2]). The property testing example from Section 7.2 highlights this point.\nOur paper shows in particular that inf-CLIP is able to separate, i.e. distinguish, all graphs up to a permutation (i.e. non-isomorphic) and so is our relaxed 1-CLIP algorithm in expectation.\n\n2. The source of randomness of 1-CLIP comes from the fact that we add a single color to every node, the color being chosen randomly. It is thus similar to the addition of noise to every node attribute of the graph. Theorem 3 states that 1-CLIP is universal in expectation, although its variance may be large in practice. However, our experiments in Section 7 indicate that the variance remains relatively small, while being more expressive than classical MPNNs (see Section 7.2 and the property testing task).\n\n3. In our experiments on real datasets, we think that the variance of the 10-fold cross validation accuracy is probably larger than the improvement due to an increase in colors. There was thus no visible improvement to using more colors, and we decided not to display these results in the paper to gain a little extra space. We will add the results of 0-CLIP (without any coloring), 1-CLIP and 16-CLIP to the appendix.\n\n4.

We will update the paper in the next few days to address your concerns.\n\n1. While k-CLIP is indeed not, strictly speaking, permutation invariant due to its randomness, note that its probability distribution is permutation invariant. Hence, k-CLIP can be seen as a permutation invariant representation with added (unbiased) noise. A discussed in Remark 1, the variance of k-CLIP may be reduced (and thus come closer to a deterministic representation) by averaging over multiple independent samples of the representation. Of course, this incurs an additional computation cost, and experimental evaluations suggest that the noise of k-CLIP remains sufficiently small in practice.\nThe difficult question of finding deterministic representations that are both computationally tractable and provably universal is very interesting and left for future work. However, we discuss at the end of Section 5.4 the fact that such a universal and tractable graph representation may not exist, as it would also solve the graph isomorphism problem in polynomial time: a notoriously difficult problem in graph theory.\n\n2. In the experiments on real graph classification datasets, the number of colors did not have a large impact on the accuracy (as for other competitors such as RP-GIN), and we thus decided not to report these results to gain a little extra space.

The main novelty of this paper is to provide a theoretical analysis of universality for graph neural networks. The proposed algorithm in Section 5 is a direct application of the theory of separable neural networks (a novel concept defined in Section 3.3) that we develop in Section 3 and 4 as well as in the supplementary material. We give another use case of our theoretical framework in Section 6 for permutation invariant sets (this section will be removed). To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 2 with this level of generality is a novel result and does not appear in the GNN literature (as well as the following propositions and corollaries).\nOur experiments on graph classification and property testing benchmarks show that, unlike most deep learning SOTA algorithms, our method is able to reach state of the art results in these two relatively different tasks.\n\n4.

Also, the notation in Eq. (8) is not rigorous, what do you exactly mean by psi(x, y) as an MLP? Do you mean concatenating x and y as an input to MLP?\n\n4, The experimental results on the benchmark datasets are less impressive as the mean performances are close to the WL-test results and the variances are considerably large.
