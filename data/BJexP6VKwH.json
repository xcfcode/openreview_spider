We propose a covariate and label distribution CO-ALignment (COAL) model to tackle this problem.

Where and how did you estimate the target label distribution?\nThe target label distribution is estimated with our self-training process. As we have trained the classifier with class-balanced source samples, we believe the output labeling results of this classifier on the target domain can better reflect the target label distribution. Then, if we use the target samples of this label distribution to train our classifier, as the empirical risk can better reflect the target classification risk, we can alleviate the problem caused by label distribution difference.\n\nQ2.

The shift assumption does not solve the \"Covariate Shift\" and \"Label Shift\" simultaneously.\nSame as in our response to reviewer #1, we would like to first clarify the terms in our paper. We agree that we should not use the term \"Covariate Shift\" and \"Label Shift\" in our paper, which have different meanings with the wider range of literature. In our paper, what we really meant is \"the shift in feature distribution\" ($p(x) \\not= q(x)$) and \"the shift in label distribution\" ($p(y) \\not= q(y)$). We've revised these terms in our updated version.\n\nOther than this, we agree with your explanation that we are trying to minimize the differences of the joint distribution in an anticasual direction.\n\nQ2. The novelty of the method is limited.\nFirst of all, as we mentioned in the Introduction, there indeed have been several works towards this problem [1][2][3]. While these papers provide a solid theoretical analysis of this problem under additional constraints on distributions p and q, no practical algorithm which can solve real-world cross-domain problems has been proposed ([1] and [2] are not computationally feasible for large-scale data; [3] empirically does not work well in our experiments, shown in Section 4.2). We therefore make the claim that we provided the first practical solution to this problem.\n\nSecondly, we agree the prototypical-based conditional distribution alignment used the architecture in [4]. However, we would like to emphasize that this algorithm design has a clear motivation--to align the conditional feature distribution,--and is also empirically demonstrated in Section 4 to be effective.\n\nQ3. Minimax entropy domain adaptation in the unsupervised setting is problematic.\nFirst of all, we agree that it is challenging to estimate the class prototypes in the target domain in an unsupervised setting. However, this is not unique to our paper and affects *all* unsupervised domain adaptation methods that aim to align the conditional feature distributions. We believe that in order to ensure the robustness of the conditional distribution alignment, additional assumptions (like the one in [3]) are needed.\nSecondly, we agree that under our proposed setting, using a shared feature function and the classifier cannot produce a single classifier that has a minimum risk on both the source and target domain,  since the source and target labels are distributed differently. To explicitly address this problem, inspired by works in label shift ([5][6]), we tried to train the classifier with weighted ERM, where importance is computed by the ratio of marginal label distributions in target and source domain ($w_i = \\frac{q(y_i)}{p(y_i)}$ for each label $i$). We hoped in this way, the classifier can be optimized to better reduce the real empirical risk on the target domain. We tried to use three kinds of label distribution ratios: (1) the ratio computed by our pseudo labels; (2) the ground-truth (GT) ratio; (3) the ratio computed by the method in [5]. However, we empirically found even with the GT ratio we did not see significant benefit of this process. On the other hand, our proposed approach worked well empirically.\n\nQ4. The authors should provide more explanation on how balanced sampling and self-training could help diminish the effect of label shift.\nWe agree that use of balanced sampling ignores the original distribution of the source domain but does not affect the label distribution of the target domain. However, it also helps us to learn an unbiased classifier that is used for self-training. Therefore, we tend to believe that the output results of this classifier on the target domain can better reflect the label distribution of the target domain (which is called the estimation of target label distribution in our paper). Furthermore, ideally, if we can estimate the target label distribution well, the classifier trained with the target samples with this distribution could better fit the target label distribution, as the empirical risk can better reflect the target classification risk. As discussed in the last question, we tried to explicitly use the estimated target label distribution to compute the importance weight for classifier training as in [5][6], but we did not empirically observe any benefit.\n\nQ5.

The terms \"Covariate Shift\" and \"Label Shift\" are confusing.\nThank you for pointing out that the terms \"Covariate Shift\" and \"Label Shift\" as used in our paper have a different meaning from the wider range of literature. In our paper, what we really mean is that we have a \"shift in the feature distribution\" ($p(x) \\not= q(x)$) and a \"shift in the label distribution\" ($p(y) \\not= q(y)$). To avoid confusion, we've revised these terms in our updated paper (both in the title and in content), our new title is:\n\u201cDomain Adaptation with Feature and Label Distribution Co-Alignment\u201d\n\nQ2. The proposed problem is just \"Covariate Shift\".\nThanks for pointing out that in our paper, we did not specify an important component of our \"Covariate Shift\" assumption: $p(y|x) = q(y|x)$. Our proposed setting could actually be seen as a special situation of \"Covariate Shift\" where we also emphasize the difference between the marginal label distributions in the source and target domain. In this way, our proposed method is a more generalized version of traditional methods solving the \"Covariate Shift\" problem which mostly focus on the change in $p(x)$. Most methods developed for unsupervised deep domain adaptation mostly assume that $p(y)$ does not change: even though they may not state this assumption explicitly, the empirical evaluation is done on datasets that are nearly label-balanced. One of our main contributions is to show that *if* the distribution over labels does change, it can severely affect existing methods\u2019 performance. We have updated the draft to include the $p(y|x) = q(y|x)$ assumption to clarify these points.\nThe reason why we define our experiment setting as \u201cGeneralized Domain Adaptation\u201d is based on the fact that most conventional unsupervised deep domain adaptation approaches deal with feature distributions but ignore the shift in the label distributions, which limits their generalizability to domain adaptation in real applications. This is theoretically analyzed in [1] and [2] and empirically shown by our experiments. In our setting, a model should cope *both* with the situation where only a shift of feature distribution exists *as well as* the situation where shifts in feature and label distributions occur simultaneously. In this work we try to emphasize how important it is for Domain Adaptation methods to generalize to the applications where $p(x) \\not= q(x)$ while $p(y) \\not= q(y)$, which are abundant in the real world. In this sense, our proposed setting is actually a more general situation than the problem that previous unsupervised deep domain adaptation methods really focused on.\n\nQ3. What is the benefit of the similarity-based classifier?\nBy using the similarity-based classifier, we can encourage the representation of each sample to be closer to its corresponding weight vector, which explicitly reduces the intra-class variance in the embedding space. Therefore, we regard the weight vector for each category as the prototype of the samples of this class, which facilitates our subsequent prototype-based conditional distribution alignment. \n\nQ4. The theory of Shai Ben David is misattributed to Zhao et al. 2019.\nAs Zhao clarifies (https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJexP6VKwH&noteId=HkgBK9A1sr), Eq.5 in our paper is different from the one in Ben-David et al. 2010. Furthermore, the motivation of having this theory here is to illustrate the limitation of learning domain-invariant representations, which is in line with Johannson et al. 2019 [1] and Wu et al. 2019 [2].\n\nQ5. There are some wrong descriptions in the paper.\nThank you for pointing out this problem. We have rewritten all the related sections in the updated paper to solve this problem.\n\nThank you again for your helpful comments.

We truly appreciate your recognition of the strength of our paper. \n\nHere, we address your comments as below:\n\nQ1. How is your label shift different to concept drift in supervised learning?\nThe label shift mentioned in our paper refers to the fact that the label distributions of the source and target domains are different ($p(y) \\not= q(y)$). Concept drift on the other hand focuses on the problem that $p(y|x) \\not= q(y|x)$.\n\nQ2. Why the experiments are conducted only on image data?\nThank you for your suggestions. Currently, our problem and approach are targeted at visual domain adaptation, therefore, we did not provide experiments on non-image datasets. However, we think it's worth trying other non-image datasets with a shift in feature distribution and label distribution simultaneously. We leave the exploration of non-image dataset using our model as future work. \n\nQ3. How do you make sure the result of self-training remains valid?\n To make this process more robust, we use the confidence score to select the most reliable pseudo labels. We empirically found this process is effective in multiple domain pairs and across multiple domain adaptation datasets, which encourages us to incorporate it into our method. Improving the robustness of self-training in our context could be a very interesting and important path to enhance our method.\n\nQ4. How to make sure the performance is not the fact of cheating the result to a local optimum with the optimized cost function?\nOur loss function is composed of the self-training classification loss for aligning label distributions and the minimax entropy loss for aligning conditional feature distributions. How to deal with the competition of these two losses during optimization is a long-lasting problem in deep learning research, which is beyond the scope of this paper. As we empirically demonstrated, most of the previous unsupervised deep domain adaptation methods fail to work on the proposed Generalized Domain Adaptation problem. Therefore, the goal of our method is to effectively tackle the domain adaptation with the shift in feature distribution and label distribution simultaneously, not to study the strategy to optimize the proposed loss functions to a global optimum.

In detail, the prototype-based conditional alignment and self-training based label distribution estimation is utilized. Empirically evaluation is conducted on three datasets to show the superiority of the proposed method. However, the work suffers the following weaknesses:\n \n1). The main concern of this work is its shift assumption. In the language of dataset shift, the joint distribution p(x, y) can decompose into two different manners, which are p(y|x)p(x) and p(x|y)p(y). Covariate shift is defined as p(x) not equals to q(x), while the conditional output distribution is invariant p(x|y) = q(x|y), where p(.) and q(.) are distribution for source and target domains. Label shift is defined as p(y) not equals to q(y), while the conditional input distribution p(y|x) = q(y|x). The work assumes that p(x|y) not equals to q(x|y) meanwhile p(x) not equals to q(y). It means to minimize the joint distribution p(x, y), which is well motivated. However, it does not solve the two abovementioned shifts simultaneously here. Instead, it aims to minimize the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in the anticausal direction. See more definitions in the papers \u201cWhen training and test sets are different: characterizing learning transfer\u201d and \u201cOn causal and anticausal learning.\u201d\n \n2). The novelty of the paper is limited. While the authors claim that it is the first time to approach it in the proposed manner, the problem of both p(y) and p(x|y) change is not new. For instance, in the paper \u201cDomain adaptation under the target and conditional shift,\u201d the case of distribution shift correction also does not assume the same conditional distribution and marginal distribution for the source domain and the target domain. Also, the fulfill of conditional alignment is used the formulation and architecture of the work \u201cSemi-supervised Domain Adaptation via Minimax Entropy,\u201d except that there is no labeled target data in the target domain (see Eq.(1)). Besides, the notation f in Fig. 2 is missing the description of Section 3.           \n \n3).  Although the prototype-based method does help in minimizing the problem of p(x|y) not equals to q(x|y), using the minimax entropy domain adaptation in an unsupervised setting is problematic. Without a few labeled target data points, it is challenging to learn the discriminative features for the target domain. If positives and negatives (suppose it is a binary classification) are severely overlapped in the target domain,  the learned prototypes could be not consistent with those in the source domain. In other words, the prototypes might not indicate the same classes for source and target. Another issue is that the proposed model cannot solve the problem given in the assumption. In detail, the assumption is p(x, y) not equals to q(x, y), using the shared feature function F(.) and classifier C(.) for the source and the target cannot obtain domain-invariant feature and adaptive target predictor at the same time.\n \n4). There is an issue in the label distribution by self-training. As the authors claimed, balanced sampling could diminish the effect of the label shift. However, there is no substantial theoretical evidence on this. Intuitively, the balanced sampling only ignores the original marginal distribution of the target domain. The authors should provide more explanation on it. Meanwhile, the sampling couldn\u2019t work when there is a large number of categories. For self-training, it seems no mechanism to alleviate the label shift. Besides, the iterative learning manner heavily depends on the initialization of self-training, i.e., the top-k samples might not represent the marginal distribution.\n \n5). For the theoretical insights, first of all, Eq.(5) is given in \u201cA theory of learning from different domains,\u201d Shai Ben-David et al., Machine Learning, 2010. Second, there is a mistake in Eq.(6). The second term on the right of the inequality is not JS divergence of distributions over x. Instead, it is JS divergence of those after transformation of x, z (see the subsection An information-theoretic lower bound, Zhao et al. 2019b).
