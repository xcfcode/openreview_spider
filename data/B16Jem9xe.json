Here, we develop  our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models---models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data---and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding  in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.", "keywords": ["Unsupervised Learning"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Invite to Workshop Track", "comment": "This paper provides a unifying review of various forms of generative model.

There is no issue optimizing this with respect to r. The issue is the optimization with respect to q --- this is not possible due to the log q term which is not available for implicit models.\n\nBalaji\n\nPS: Our paper wasn't accepted to the conference btw.", "title": "Response"}, "SJjEwvLIg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkBDDOofe", "comment": "\u201cWhich method should I choose when I want to learn an implicit model?

And the answer is,  (perhaps not surprisingly) it really depends on the problem. We don\u2019t yet have a clear understanding of if and when one method is necessarily theoretically superior to another for all possible models (and the family of implicit models is huge!). There are some practical differences, e.g. a classifier as a discriminator is more amenable to minibatch training as opposed to moment matching which could affected by minibatch noise; hence, if the dataset is large, classifier approach might be preferable to moment matching. One could also think of combining multiple discriminator losses; this could help avoid the generator overfitting to any particular discriminator.

We aim to cite it as much as possible, citing the book as our key source (rather than individual papers and specific names such as KLIEP and LSIE). It is important to keep in mind that estimating the density ratio is only part of the problem when learning in GANs and implicit generative models, and why our discussion has taken the form it has.\n\n\u201cI think it would be interesting to think about how this function is related to the witness function commonly used in MMD and what the properties of this function are compared to the witness function - perhaps showing the two things for simple distributions.\u201d \nSriperumbudur et al showed in the paper \u201cOn the empirical estimation of integral probability metrics\u201d 2012 that f-divergences and integral probability metrics (MMD, Wasserstein) intersect only at the total variation distance. See also Arthur Gretton\u2019s slides at the NIPS adversarial training workshop:  http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/papers/testing_workshop.pdf\n\nFor likelihood ratio estimation, we do not want to estimate the convex function of the ratio directly, since this will not allow us to exploit the duality properties of the divergence.\n\nThe importance of hypothesis testing is perhaps a philosophical one. Recognising the role of hypothesis testing (to test if two distributions are equal) helps to ask the question of why we should compute the density ratio or density difference, which is otherwise vague and unclear. Once this is recognised, the path to using the myriad of methods for comparing two hypotheses such as two-sample tests, density ratios, density-differences, and classical tests such as Wald and likelihood ratio test, are all valid tools for learning implicit models. This view has been recognised by other authors as well, e.g., Lopez-Paz and Oquab (2016). \n\n\n", "title": "Response to AnonReviewer1"}, "SyFr4v8Lx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B16Jem9xe", "comment": "The reviewers have two common concerns (1) relevance of this paper to ICLR, and (2) its novelty. We address the common concerns here and address other questions individually.\n\nThe aim of our paper is to review different approaches for learning in implicit generative models; GANs are a special case of implicit generative models and our work helps understand connections between GAN variants as well as understand how GANs are related to the wider statistical literature. We are not aware of any other work in the GAN literature which discusses the connections to approximate Bayesian computation, moment-matching and two sample-testing, unsupervised-as-supervised learning, optimal transport, likelihood free inference, or non-maximum likelihood estimation, even though these methods are clearly related. We believe these connections would be interesting to ICLR community for at least two reasons: (1) we can borrow tools from the related literature to improve optimisation and analyse convergence and (2) we can use GAN-like techniques to train differentiable simulators in other application domains (e.g high energy physics, economics, ecology), thereby opening up exciting research directions. AnonReviewer4 writes \u201cI believe this work is significant - it provides a bridge for language and methods used in multiple parts of statistics and machine learning. This has the potential to accelerate progress.\u201d And AnonReviewer1 writes \u201cIt is well written and a good read, and one I would recommend to people who would like to get involved in GANs.\u201d This was our aim, and why this paper is of relevance to ICLR.\n\nNovelty: The view of hypothesis testing gives an insight about the learning principle used in likelihood free / implicit models. This view also helps understand connections between variants of GANs; for instance, methods that use the density ratio (e.g. the original GAN paper, f-GAN and b-GAN) or the density difference (e.g. generative moment matching networks). To the best of our knowledge, this unifying view through hypothesis testing is novel (see also the concurrent submissions by Lopez-paz and Oquab (2016) and Uehara et al. (2016)). To quote AnonReviewer4, \u201cthe individual pieces are not novel, and yet the exposition of all of them in the same space with clear outline of the connections between them is novel.\u201d \nThe unifying view opens up lots of interesting research directions, e.g., since our initial arxiv submission, Kareletsos (2016) has published \u201cAdversarial Message Passing For Graphical Models\u201d https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05048.pdf where he proposes GAN-like techniques for minimising divergence for message passing in graphical models.
