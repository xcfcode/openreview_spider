It consists of many different components that are not conceptually intuitive. Contrary to some of the recent approaches for modeling visual relations (i.e. Non-Local Networks or Space-Time Video Graphs), the proposed model is much more difficult to understand. In my opinion, this is a big disadvantage because the models that are most useful to the community are usually conceptually (and technically) simple, yet effective.\n- The authors assume that the input features to the TOQ net are hand-engineered, and thus, are not learnable. This is very different to most modern approaches, which typically try to learn all the features from raw pixels end-to-end. Very few recent methods (to the best of my knowledge) rely on hand-engineered features for video modeling/action recognition. This begs the question how applicable the proposed approach is to modern computer vision community.\n- The biggest weakness of the paper is its experimental evaluation. The authors evaluate their approach on 2 small-scale artificial video datasets. Thus, it is not clear whether the proposed approach would generalize to real datasets such as Kinetics, Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, etc. Most current action recognition methods evaluate their model on these large-scale real-world datasets. Thus, I think it is imperative that the authors would conduct thorough experiments not only on their small artificial datasets but also on the datasets that are most often used by the action recognition community. In particular, datasets like Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, or Charades require spatiotemporal relation modeling as demonstrated by prior work (i.e. Space-Time Video Graphs). \n- The comparison with the pixel-level baselines (i.e. Non-Local Networks, or Space-Time Video Graphs) might not be exactly fair. The authors adapt these baselines to the dataset/task specific scenarios. Compared to their own model, the authors don't have as many incentives to tune these baseline models for their specific tasks. Thus, I believe that the experiments on the real-world large scale datasets such as Kinetics, Something-Something and Charades are essential for validating that the proposed approach is better than these prior methods.\n- Missing relevant work: Wang et al., \"Something-Else: Compositional Action Recognition with Spatial-Temporal Interaction Networks.\" (CVPR 2020).\n\nRebuttal Requests:\n- The authors should include thorough experiments on the real-world large-scale datasets such as Kinetics, Something-Something, and Charades. The currently used datasets are not sufficient to verify the generalizability and usefulness of the proposed approach.\n\n==Post Rebuttal Response:\n\nI read the rebuttal, and unfortunately it didn't address most of my pressing concerns. I appreciate the authors' efforts to add new experiments on other datasets. However, in my opinion these new datasets are not very relevant for the action recognition community, i.e. they are small, and they are rarely used to compare the effectiveness of a particular model. In my initial review, I listed a few datasets that are most commonly used for action recognition comparisons. In my view, without comparisons on these more popular datasets it is very difficult to tell the real value of the proposed approach. If the authors could demonstrate close to state-of-the-art performance on those datasets I would be more convinced that the proposed approach is effective. Currently, most of the comparison are done w.r.t baselines that are implemented by the authors which is insufficient in my opinion. Therefore, I stand by my original recommendation of rejecting the paper.", "title": "The paper proposes Temporal and Object Quantification Nets (TOQ-Nets), which can be used for learning composable action concepts from time sequences that describe the properties and relations of multiple entities.

For now, we kindly refer the reviewer to the overview paragraphs in Section 3, for a holistic view of the proposed model. The first remark in Section 3 also discusses the representational power of TOQ-Nets. \n\nTOQ-Net makes a clear, simple, meaningful contribution: using object and temporal quantification operations from first-order logic and linear temporal logic to model the relational and temporal relationships between entities and events.   These representational structures have been demonstrated to be useful for characterizing complex temporal events in a variety of domains [1, 2].\n\nAlthough we demonstrate it on some tasks that seem related to computer vision, the TOQ-Net is  task-agnostic, is fundamentally different from action recognition models in computer vision, and has unique advantages such as strong generalization to scenarios where there are more agents and objects than were present during training. The learned relational and temporal representations are also robust with respect to temporally warped sequences, and easily transfer to other prediction tasks in a similar domain.\n\nIn our model, the input transformation layer can be seen as defining basic predicates and relations that will be useful for defining more complex concepts. The relational reasoning layers can build quantified first-order logic (FOL) expressions over these basic properties and relations, and can construct expressions that could be interpretable as \u201cthe player is close to the ball.\u201d The temporal reasoning layer can represent temporal operations applied to these complex expressions, such as \u201cthe player is close to the ball until the ball moves with high speed,\u201d inspired by linear temporal logic (LTL). The quantification operations in these two types of layers realize FOL and LTL quantifiers: for example, the existential quantifier in the sentence \u201cthere is a player such that the player is close to the ball,\u201d and the until quantifier in the sentence \u201cthe player is close to the ball until the ball moves with high speed.\u201d\n\nThe closest structure to the TOQ-Net that can be achieved with traditional NN structures would be to make GNN\u2019s with one node per entity per time step and then stack them into a fairly deep structure, and this is the idea of the Space-Time graph [3]. We have made comparisons to their approach and TOQ-Net outperforms it.\n\n\n\n\n**Q2: Hand-engineered features.**\n\nA2: All of the input features used in our experiments are physical features such as positions and velocities that are part of the state representation in the physics engines we use. These features are not specifically designed for our domains, but are general across sports analysis and robotic manipulation. We also kindly refer the reviewer to our additional results on the application of TOQ-Net on real-world datasets, including the Toyota Smarthome and the volleyball dataset, which use human positions and skeletons as features.\n\n\n\n**Q3: Evaluation on real-world datasets.**\n\nA3: Please refer to our general response (Q2).\n\n\n\n**Q4: Relevant work: Wang et al.**\n\nA4: We have cited and discussed the suggested paper in the revision.

This paper has proposed a hierarchical deep temporal network that integrates a person-level and a group-level feature extractor. The high-level idea is to use RNNs to encode per-person features across the video and use another RNN to combine features of individual persons into a group feature for every frame.

We agree that these models are conceptually similar to each other, and we will clarify our contribution along the following lines.\n1. Our relational reasoning layer is a direct application of NLM. It is similar to applying GNNs per-frame, except that it handles high-order edges (hyperedges) and uses logic-inspired quantification operations. It can provably realize first-order Horn clauses, up to the model complexity (e.g., the number of layers and the hidden dimensions).\n2. Temporal quantification is fundamentally different from existential or universal quantification in first-order logic. Intuitively, first-order quantifications are permutation-invariant, but temporal quantification needs to take the order of events into consideration. Thus, we draw inspiration from linear temporal logic (LTL) and introduce temporal quantification layers to match the model theory of LTL.\n3. Our model is substantially different from other existing work on applying GNNs to spatial-temporal modeling. For example, in STGCN, temporal information is captured with temporal convolutions. In Space-Time Graphs, the same entities from adjacent frames are connected with edges. This fundamentally limits the generalization of such networks because convolutional kernels are not scale-invariant. The authors used graph convolution on the derived graph for modeling input sequences. We have compared our work to both approaches and show advantages over them, especially in generalization to situations with a different number of entities or to time-warped sequences.\n\n\n\n\n**Q2: Graph net/relation net with high-order interaction terms.**\n\nA2: Please refer to our general response (Q1).\n\n\n\n**Q3: References.**\n\nA3: Thanks for the great suggestions.

We have included additional experiments for a more comprehensive comparison between TOQ-Net and STGCN. Adding binary inputs such as the distance between each pair of agents (namely, STGCN-2D) slightly improves the model performance on the standard 9-way classification test.

[1]\n\n  Toyota Smarthome is a dataset that contains videos of daily living activities such as \u201cwalk\u201d, \u201ctake pills\u201d, and \u201cuse laptop\u201d. It also comes with 3D-skeleton detections. There are around 16.1k videos in the dataset, including 19 activity classes. The videos\u2019 length varies between a few seconds to 3 minutes and we subsample 30 frames for each video. We split them into training (9.9k), validation (2.5k), and testing (3.6k). Similar to the soccer event dataset, we treat human joints  as entities, and use the physical feature extracted from the 3D-skeletons as the input. The input consists of the position of joints, the velocity of joints, the distance between pairs of joints, and joint angles. We evaluated our model and STGCN on the 19-way classification task. We also test model performance on time-warped sequences (2x quick motion).\n\n  \n  |         | 19-way classification | Time warp (QuickMo 2x) |\n  | ------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |\n  | TOQ-Net | $42.0$                | $\\mathbf{41.2}$                 |\n  | STGCN   | $\\mathbf{43.0}$                | $32.3$                 |\n  \n  Our model achieves a comparable accuracy to STGCN on the standard classification task. Importantly, on the generalization test to time-warped sequences, our model encounters only a 0.8 performance drop where STGCN drops 10.7, which indicates that the learned temporal structures by our model improve model generalization to varying time courses.\n  \n- The Volleyball dataset. [2]\n\n  The volleyball dataset contains 4830 video clips collected from 55 youtube volleyball videos. They are labeled with 8 group activities such as \u201cleft spike\u201d and \u201cright pass\u201d. Each video contains 20 frames with the labeled group activity performed at the 10-th frame. The dataset also includes manual annotations for players at each frame, which consists of the bounding box, the indicator of whether the player is involved in the group activity, and the individual action such as \u201csetting\u201d, \u201cdigging\u201d, and \u201cspiking\u201d. We use manual annotations, processed by an MLP as the input feature for each player. We train models to classify the video into one of the eight group activities. In our experiment, we adapt the train/val/test split in [2], i.e., 24, 15, and 16 of 55 videos are used for training, validation, and testing, respectively.\n\n  \n  |         | 8-way classification | Time warp (Shift) | Time warp (QuickMo 2x) |\n  | ------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |\n  | TOQ-Net | $73.3$               | $\\mathbf{70.3}$            | $\\mathbf{70.7}$                 |\n  | STGCN   | $\\mathbf{73.6}$               | $39.5$            | $48.6$                 |\n\n  On the standard classification task, TOQ-Net achieves a comparable performance with STGCN. When we perform time warping on the input sequences, STGCN\u2019s performance drops by >25.0% while our model drops only 3%. This further suggests the generalization ability of TOQ-Net w.r.t. varying time courses.\n\n\n\n```\n[1] Toyota Smarthome: Real-World Activities of Daily Living.
