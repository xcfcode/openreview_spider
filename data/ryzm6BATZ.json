Our approach expands on the Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN) by outlining some of the short-comings of the original energy and loss functions. We address these short-comings by incorporating an l1 score, the Gradient Magnitude Similarity score, and a chrominance score into the new energy function. We then provide a set of systematic experiments that explore its hyper-parameters. We show that each of the energy function's components is able to represent a slightly different set of features, which require their own evaluation criteria to assess whether they have been adequately learned. We show that models using the new energy function are able to produce better image representations than the BEGAN model in predicted ways.", "keywords": ["generative adversarial networks", "gans", "deep learning", "image modeling", "image generation", "energy based models"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "The paper received borderline-negative scores (6,5,5) with R1 and R2 having significant difficulty with the clarity of the paper.

Mostly it is hard to estimate what is the contribution of the model and how the results differ from baseline models.\n\nClarity:\nI would say this is one of the weak points of the paper - the paper is not well motivated and the results are not clearly presented. \n\nOriginality:\nSeems original.\n\nPros:\n* Interesting energy formulation and variation over BEGAN\n\nCons:\n* Not a clear paper\n* results are only partially motivated and analyzed", "title": "A very technical paper with unclear significance.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "HJZIu0Kef": {"type": "review", "replyto": "ryzm6BATZ", "review": "This paper proposed some new energy function in the BEGAN (boundary equilibrium GAN framework), including l_1 score, Gradient magnitude similarity score, and chrominance score, which are motivated and borrowed from the image quality assessment techniques. These energy component in the objective function allows learning of different set of features and determination on whether the features are adequately represented. experiments on the using different hyper-parameters of the energy function, as well as visual inspections on the quality of the learned images, are presented. \n\nIt appears to me that the novelty of the paper is limited, in that the main approach is built on the existing BEGAN framework with certain modifications. For example, the new energy function in equation (4) larges achieves similar goal as the original energy (1) proposed by Zhao et. al (2016), except that the margin loss in (1) is changed to a re-weighted linear loss, where the dynamic weighting scheme of k_t is borrowed  from the work of Berthelot et. al (2017). It is not very clear why making such changes in the energy would supposedly make the results better, and no further discussions are provided.  On the other hand, the several energy component introduced are simply choices of the similarity measures as motivated from the image quality assessment, and there are probably a lot more in the literature whose application can not be deemed as a significant contribution to either theories or algorithm designs in GAN.\n\nMany results from the experimental section rely on visual evaluations, such as in Figure~4 or 5; from these figures, it is difficult to clearly pick out the winning images.

In particular, the authors propose to change the energy function associated with the auto-encoder, from an L2 norm (a single number) to an energy function with multiple components. Their energy function is inspired by the structured similarity index (SSIM), and the three components they use are the L1 score, the gradient magnitude similarity score, and the chromium score. Using this energy function, the authors hypothesize, that it will force the generator to generate realistic images. They test their hypothesis on a single dataset, namely, the CelebA dataset. \n\nReview: \nWhile the idea proposed in the paper is somewhat novel and there is nothing obviously wrong about the proposed approach, I thought the paper is somewhat incremental. As a result I kind of question the impact of this result. My suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the experimental section is extremely weak. In particular the authors test their model on a single relatively straightforward dataset. Any reason why the authors did not try on other datasets involving natural images? As a result I feel that the title and the claims in the paper are somewhat misleading and premature: that the proposed techniques improves the training and evaluation of energy based gans. \n\nOver all the paper is clearly written and easy to understand. \n\nBased on its incremental nature and weak experiments, I'm on the margin with regards to its acceptance. Happy to change my opinion if other reviewers strongly think otherwise with good reason and are convinced about its impact.

We explicitly state in section 2.1 that:\n\n\"It is not particularly surprising that these modifications to Equation 2 show improvements. Zhao et al. (2016) devote an appendix section to the correct selection of m and explicitly mention that the \u201cbalance between... real and fake samples[s]\u201d (italics theirs) is crucial to the correct selection of m. Unsurprisingly, a dynamically updated parameter that accounts for this balance is likely to be the best instantiation of the authors\u2019 intuitions and visual inspection of the resulting output supports this (see Berthelot et al., 2017).\"\n\nWhat kind of discussion would you have liked to see? If you're looking for a formal analysis, we would suggest reviewing Berthelot et al., (2017) and Arjovsky, Chintala, and Bottou (2017) for their discussions of the advantages of the Wasserstein distance over the alternatives. Section 5 bullet 3 in the latter explicitly addresses the differences between the original EBGAN margin loss and the Wasserstein distance, if you are interested. Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the former address the equilibrium hyper-parameters of the BEGAN model (e.g., gamma, k_t).\n\nCould you also unpack what you mean by, \"there are probably a lot more [similarity measures] in the [IQA] literature whose application can not be deemed as a significant contribution to either theories or algorithm designs in GAN\"? We assume that you are not saying that the mere existence of other methods is damning to the scientific study of some subset of those methods. Please clarify how our modification of the energy-based formulation of GANs to emphasize a more important role for the energy function (generally assumed to be an l1 or l2 norm across many studies) is not a significant contribution to GAN research?\n\nCould you also unpack what you mean by, \"human model\"? We would like to clarify that the function of Figure 5 is to illustrate how image diversity has not been lost when using the new evaluation. It is not trying to show how one set of images are better than another.", "title": "Clarifications"}, "SJfxhQ7WG": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "H1NEs7Clz", "comment": "Thank you for your review and comments.\n\nWe have been working on extending our research to include other datasets. The primary challenge is that the stock BEGAN model does rather poorly on datasets that do not have a lot of regular structure like the CelebA dataset. Consequently, we have preliminary results that are suggestive for MNIST and the msceleb dataset, but we've been unable to show any interesting results on Imagenet or the LSUN bedrooms dataset. \n\nOur suspicion is that these are issues with the stock network design/structure. We are currently working with an EBM-based modification of the model from \"Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation\" (this conference), which seems to replicate our results on other datasets. Our research is still very preliminary, though.\n\nWe are curious what the 'correct' number of datasets is for a conference proceedings paper (which is extremely short). The original BEGAN paper only uses one, custom dataset. The EBGAN paper has 4 (if you count MNIST). The WGAN-GP paper has 2 plus some artificial datasets.
