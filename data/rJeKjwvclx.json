How- ever, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointer decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.", "keywords": ["Natural language processing", "Deep learning", "Applications"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The program committee appreciates the authors' response to concerns raised in the reviews.

In order to gain insights into how much each additional iteration in the decoder help, I would like to see the following -- for every iteration report the mean F1 for questions that converged in that iteration along with the number of questions that converged in that iteration.\n\nWe do not have strong support (number of examples) for high iteration (e.g. 3-4 iterations) examples. We did find in our ablation study that allowing the model multiple iterations, as opposed to forcing it to a single iteration, improves performance.\n\nBelow, we show the 4-iteration model\u2019s performance across iterations needed to converge. \n----------  ------------------           ---------\niterations   mean f1                            frequency\n1                 0.7660381405761181     9935\n2                0.5698158862824868   527\n3                0.5464594744971136    50\n4                0.6213130048723088    58\n----------  ------------------           ---------\n\n>>>>2.

In order to estimate how much modeling of attention in the encoder helps, it would be good if authors could report the performance of the model when attention is not modeled at all in the encoder (neither over question, nor over document).\n\nWe attempted a model without attention, in which the encoder first ingests the question then the document. The decoder then points over the document encoding as usual. The best validation performance we obtained for this model is 41.9% F1 and 33.3% exact match.\n\n>>>>4. I would like to see the variation in the performance of the proposed model for questions that require different types of reasoning (table 3 in SQuAD paper). This would provide insights into what are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model w.r.t the type reasoning required.\n\nI emphasize with your position that we analyze the model with respect to the reasoning required to gain more insights into what it is doing. In particular, I would be very interested in seeing how each top model submitted to SQuAD differs in this regard. That said, we contacted Rajpurkar et al, the original authors of the SQuAD paper, who declined to share the 200 sampled used to estimate the statistics in Table 3 of the SQuAD paper. In particular, Pranav offered that releasing the 192 examples would have very little value of information of tuning and comparing models. That said, they are considering including in the next iteration of the dataset a more thorough analysis for the purposes of analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each model. We will update our results when the dataset is updated.\n\n>>>>5. In Wang and Jiang (2016), the attention is predicted over question for each word in the document. But in table 2, when performing ablation study to make the proposed model similar to Wang and Jiang, C^D is set to C^Q. But isn\u2019t C^Q attention over document for each word in the question? So, how is this similar to Wang and Jiang\u2019s attention? I think QA^D will be similar to Wang and Jiang's attention since QA^D is attention over question for each word in the document. Please clarify.\n\nYou are correct, this is indeed a typo (it\u2019s suppose to be QA^D as opposed to C^Q).\n\n>>>>6.

Is there a clear trend? \n\nYes, the model consistently performs better with with more iterations, with diminishing returns as the number of iteration increases. With more iterations, the model performs better on examples in which there exists multiple potential answers (e.g. multiple people for a \"who question\").\n\n>>>>As future work, authors might try to analyze qualitative advantages of different choices in the proposed model. What type of questions are correctly answered because of co-attention mechanism instead of attention in a single direction, when using Maxout Highway Network instead of a simple MLP, etc?\n\nWe agree, we will analyze the advantages of different choices in the proposed model across different question types.

Namely, allowing the model a maximum of four passes as opposed to forcing it to a single pass increased our development F1 by 1.6%, thereby achieving the state of the art result.\n\nRegarding your point that given the model needs several iterations to localize, why must the iterations occur in the decoder?

We chose to use the same encoder module for the question and the document to avoid overfitting on the limited amount of rather short training questions. However, since the grammatical structure of question sentence is different from the structure of sentences in the document, we would like to allow for some variations between the representation space of the hidden state of questions and the space of documents. Therefore, we add nonlinear transformation at the output of the hidden state of questions. Empirically we found that it yields 0.5%~1% F1 improvement on the development set. \u2028\n\n2. As shown in our ablation study, allowing for iterations in the dynamic encoder increases our development F1 by 1.6%, thereby achieving the state of the art result.\u2028 In our ablation study in Table 2 (page 8), we show the same model but with the decoder forced to a single iteration.\n\n\n3. Different from statistical QA model, our model is a end-to-end system without any hand-crafted features, which is a key part in statistical QA models. \u2028\u2028Similar to neural QA models, we use an attention mechanism in the encoder module and feed the encoder representation to decoder for answer output. The whole framework is an attention-based encoder-decoder neural framework. But different from prior work, we propose a new co-attention encoder which compute the attention maps both from document to question and from question to document, and use the two directional attention maps to learn a co-dependent representation of the question and documen (e.g. the coattention context). We also proposed a novel dynamic decoder which allow for several iterations to locate the final answer, because given a question, there may exist several intuitive answer spans within the document, each corresponding to a local maxima. This iterative procedure provides opportunity for the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answer spans. There are some qualitative results shown in Figure 5.

Please fix it.\n\nReview Summary: The paper presents a novel and interesting model for the task of question answering on SQuAD dataset and shows that the model outperforms existing models. However, to gain more insights into the functioning of the model, I would like see more analyses of the results and one more ablation study (see weaknesses section above).\n", "title": "Objective Function", "rating": "8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "rJoWW-5Gl": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HygmEhvMg", "comment": "Hi Sahil,\n\nIn practice there are much less than 2.2 million words in SQuAD. We use GloVe embeddings for all words that exists in both SQuAD and in Common Crawl. For words that are in SQuAD and are not in Common Crawl, we use zero embeddings. You can also interpret this as replacing it with an <UNKNOWN> token that has zero embedding.", "title": "RE: A few questions about vocabulary size"}, "HygmEhvMg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJeKjwvclx", "comment": "Hi,\n\nA sentence from Section 4 reads: \"We limit the vocabulary to words that are present in the Common Crawl corpus and set embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words to zero.\" Suppose GloVe vectors' vocabulary size is k (k ~ 2.2 million). Does this mean that the vocabulary size used in this paper is exactly 1 more than GloVe's vocabulary size (k+1)? Does this mean that effectively every out of vocabulary word is replaced with an <UNKNOWN> token which has an all-zeros embedding?\n\nThanks!

However, I find it really difficult to see where the actual benefits come from compared to related architectures like the work of Wang et al. 2016, which was also submitted to ICLR. I believe much of the improvements stem from the dynamic pointer decoder which itself contains various sub-architectures. For the sake of comparability, I would be interested to see how performances would change when:\n\n- not using co-attention but only attention on the question for each context token, similar to Wang et al.\n- exchanging the rather large Highway Maxout Network by something simpler, e.g. omitting m1 and m2 completely to get directly to the output, lowering pool-sizes because they seem rather large as well or using a simple MLP instead of the HMN. The intuition behind using Maxout sounds appealing but it has not been verified in the paper.\n- allowing only one iteration for the pointer decoder (i.e., direct prediction)\n\nThanks for considering these suggestions.", "title": "Ablation study needed"}}}
