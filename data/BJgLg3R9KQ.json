According to the authors; the networks learn where to focus through a weak form of supervision based on image class labels. This paper introduces a data set that complements ImageNet with circa 500,000 human-derived attention maps, obtained through a large-scale online experiment called ClickMe. These attention maps can be used in conjunction with DCNs to add a human-in-the-loop feature that significantly improves accuracy.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThis paper is clearly within scope of the ICLR conference and addresses a relevant and challenging problem: that of directing the learning process in visual recognition tasks to focus on interesting or useful regions. This is achieved by leveraging a human-in-the-loop approach.\n\nThe paper does a fair job in motivating the research problem and describing what has been done so far in the literature to address the problem. The proposed architecture and the data collection online experiment are also described to a sufficient extent.\n\nIn my view, the main issue with this paper is the reporting of the experiment design and the analysis of the results. Many of the design choices of the experiments are simply listed and not motivated at all. The reader has to accept the design choices without any justification. The results for accuracy are simply listed in a table and some results are indicated as \u201cp<0.01\u201d but the statistical analysis is never described. Interpretability is highlighted in the abstract and introduction as an important feature of the proposed approach but the evaluation of interpretability is limited to a few anecdotes from the authors\u2019 review of the results. The paper does not present a procedure or measure for evaluating interpretability.\n\nOTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n- The verb \u201cattend\u201d is used in many places where \u201cfocus\u201d seems to be more appropriate.\n\n- \u201cwe ran a rapid experiment\u201d: what does rapid mean in this context?\n\n- \u201cthe proposed GALA architecture is grounded in visual neuroscience\u201d : this and many other statements are only elaborated upon in the appendix. I understand that page limit is always an issue but I think it is important to prioritise this and similar motivations and put at least a basic description in the main body\n\nUPDATE\n\nMy most serious concerns have been addressed in the revised version.\n", "title": "An interesting and relevant paper with poor justification for study design and analysis", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "H1gDHhddR7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HyeS0BduCm", "comment": "We have uploaded two versions of the revision.

As we mention in Section 4.4, GALA trained with ClickMe is significantly more interpretable by this metric than GALA trained without ClickMe (significance testing done with randomization tests, as is now described in the manuscript). We have also included Appendix Figure 8, which shows examples of the visual features favored by each model: the difference between the two models is dramatic. In total, we now have quantitative and qualitative evidence that GALA attention is more interpretable when it is co-trained with ClickMe on the ClickMe dataset (it explains a greater fraction of human ClickMe map variability) and on Microsoft COCO (more interpretable attention according to this new analysis). \n\nWe believe this version of the manuscript is greatly improved and we thank you all for your comments.

Below are our responses to your suggestions on improving the paper.\n\n1. We are overhauling Sections 3 and 4 to fix notation issues, improve readability, and clarify the figure. Along these lines and as you suggested, we will include a brief description of the GALA at the beginning of Section 3. The W_expand and W_shrink operations are borrowed from the manuscript of the original Squeeze-and-Excitation [1] module. We will revamp our description of these, which will also incorporate more of the neuroscience motivation. \n\n2. The regularization term forces attention maps in the network to be similar to human feature importance maps. We agree that this is why the maps for different layers in Fig. 4 look similar vs. the attention maps from a GALA trained without such constraints, which are distinct. We felt that the improved interpretability, performance, and similarity to human feature maps that fell out of using this attention supervision justified its use at each layer. We also agree that the right pairing of properly supervised attention with a much shallower network could yield a far more parsimonious architecture for problems like object recognition than the very deep and very powerful ResNets.\n\n3. We agree that the image dataset we used to compare ClickMe with Clicktionary maps is far from ideal, and we will note this in the manuscript. However, these were the only images available for such an analysis. Although it is underpowered, this analysis is also consistent with the other results we report about how the feature importance maps derived from these games are highly consistent and stereotyped between participants (section 2).\n\nAlso, you raise a good point about the split-half comparison we use to demonstrate that participants do not learn CNN strategies in ClickMe. However, such a strategy would amount to a sensitivity analysis of the CNN without knowing how much of the image it was looking at: expanded versions of the bubbles placed by human players were used to unveil those regions to the CNN. The average CNN performance of 53.64% in the first half vs. 53.61% in the second half of participants' trials also does not suggest an effective sensitivity analysis. We will perform another analysis of participant performance to see if learning took place within the first tens of trials, and report this in the manuscript.\n\n4. This is a good point.

We would like to note, however, that this is another flavor of an analysis that we present in the paper that we believe is an even more direct way of measuring interpretability: the similarity between attention masks and ClickMe maps, which describe visual features important to human observers.

We will also improve our justification for the experimental design, including a definition and more context for rapid visual recognition experiments. This experimental design has been used extensively in visual neuroscience (e.g., [2-3]), and we apologize for presenting it without appropriate context and motivation for why we chose it and the kinds of constraints that it places on participants to make visual decisions.

This randomization procedure is a common tool in biological sciences [1].\n\nA similar procedure was used to derive p-values for the correlations between model features and ClickMe maps. As we mention in the manuscript in our description of calculating the null inter-participant reliability of ClickMe maps: \u201cWe also derived a null inter-participant reliability by calculating the correlation of ClickMe maps between two randomly selected players on two randomly selected images. Across 10,000 randomly paired images, the average null correlation was $\\rho_r=0.18$, reinforcing the strength of the observed reliability.\u201d The p-values of correlations between model features and ClickMe maps are the proportion of per-image correlation coefficients that are less than this value.\n\n[1] Edgington, E.

The main contribution is three fold: i) a publicly available dataset that many researchers can use, ii) a network module to incorporate this human information that might be inserted into many networks to improve performance, and iii) some insights on the effect of such human supervision and the relation between features that humans deem important to those that neural nets deem important. \n\nSome suggestions on how to improve the paper:\n1. I find Sections 3 & 4 hard to track - some missing details and notation issues. Several variables are introduced without detailing the proper dimensions, e.g., the global feature attention vector g (which is shown in the figure actually). The relation between U and u_k isn't clear. Also, it will help to put a one-sentence summary of what this module does at the beginning of Section 3, like the last half-sentence in the caption of Figure 3. I was quite lost until I see that. Some more intuition is needed, on W_expand and W_shrink; maybe moving some of the \"neuroscience motivation\" paragraph up into the main text will help. Bold letters are used to denote many different things - in  Section 4 as a set of layers, in other places a matrix/tensor, and even an operation (F). \n\n2. Is there any explanation on why you add the regularization term to every layer in a network? This setup seems to make it easy to explain what happens in Figure 4. One interesting observation is that after your regularization, the GALA features with ClickMe maps exhibit minimal variation across layers (those shown). But without this supervision the features are highly different. What does this mean? Is this caused entirely by the regularization? Or there's something else going on, e.g., this is evidence suggesting that with proper supervision like human attention regions, one might be able to use a much shallower network to achieve the same performance as a very deep one?\n\n3. Using a set of 10 images to compute the correlation between ClickMe and Clicktionary maps isn't ideal - this is even less than the number of categories among the images. I'm also not entirely convinced that \"game outcomes from the first and second half are roughly equal\" says much about humans not using a neural net-specific strategy, since you can't rule out the case that they learned to play the game very quickly (in the first 10 of the total 380 rounds). \n\n4.
