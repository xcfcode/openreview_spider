However, MAML is notorious for being hard to train because of the existence of two learning rates. Therefore, in this paper, we derive the conditions that inner learning rate $\\alpha$ and meta-learning rate $\\beta$ must satisfy for MAML to converge to minima with some simplifications. We find that the upper bound of $\\beta$ depends on $ \\alpha$, in contrast to the case of using the normal gradient descent method. Moreover, we show that the threshold of $\\beta$ increases as $\\alpha$ approaches its own upper bound. This result is verified by experiments on various few-shot tasks and architectures; specifically, we perform sinusoid regression and classification of Omniglot and MiniImagenet datasets with a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional neural network. Based on this outcome, we present a guideline for determining the learning rates: first, search for the largest possible $\\alpha$; next, tune $\\beta$ based on the chosen value of $\\alpha$.", "keywords": ["meta-learning", "convergence"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper theoretically and empirically studies the inner and outer learning rate of the MAML algorithm and their role in convergence.

Admitting that both works concern about the stability of MAML training, we think that our work is a different type of study from Behl et al. (2019). Although contribution of Behl et al.

A guideline we suggested \u201cIdentifying the large \\alpha first and then tuning \\beta\u201d is a guideline to search the learning rates for stable training as long as  you use fixed scalar learning rates. Learning rates identified following the guideline are maximum possible fixed learning rates. Therefore, if we compare the training of the learning rates with that of Behl et al.

Our response to your reviews are as follows:\n\n\n> In Section 3.1.1, the authors ignored Tg based on an observation that Tg is small. However, even in the Appendix, the authors did not explicate the experimental setting where they reach such a conclusion. Will Tg be always small then, in any task and any dataset?\n\nWe specified that the experimental setting is the same as that of Section 5.2 except that particular learning rates are used and the total number of iterations is larger in the Appendix of the new manuscript. We confirmed that at least Tg is small under that setting where we conducted the sinusoid regression. Although we did not check the Omniglot and MiniImagenet classification, we believe that the presumption is valid enough for predicting the experimental result since the result of our theory is applicable even for these datasets and tasks.\n\n\n> Practically, we often train MAML in 5 or 10 steps instead of only one step. Will the conclusion apply to such setups? Or will the model itself diverge during the inner loop as more steps are taken, provided with a larger value of \\alpha?\n\nAlthough we do not investigate the multi-step cases, we think that our conclusion has an implication for these cases as well. Ignoring higher-order terms and assuming that our assumptions hold, the regularization term of the simplified meta-objective will be from the squared norm of the gradient to the inner product of gradient of the loss at step 0 and sum of the gradient at each step, as we mentioned in Appendix A.2 : \\tilde L(\\theta)  = L(\\theta) - \\alpha / 2 g^T g \u2014> \\tilde L(\\theta) = L(\\theta) - \\alpha / 2 \\sum_i g_k^T g_i. Intuitively, if all gradients are orthogonal each other, a multi-steps case is not that different from a one-step case. On the contrary, if all of them are in the same direction, the gradient norm will be multiplied by the number of steps, making the largest possible \\alpha will be divided by the number of steps. In the real setting, cosine similarity of gradients will be between 0 and 1, the maximum possible \\alpha is expected to be a little bit smaller.\n\n\n> Practically, we merely use vanilla SGD. The figure in the Appendix shows that the main conclusion actually does not apply to Adam, which disempower the practicability of the theoretical guideline.\n\nThank you for your feedback. We acknowledge that it would have been better if our conclusion applied to Adam as well for practicability. Because the effective learning rate of Adam is defined parameter-wise and changes during training, it was not suitable to predict the experimental result based on the conclusion from the theory about a fixed scalar learning rate. One of our contributions is suggesting to regard MAML as optimization with the negative gradient penalty and this formulation itself, of course, can be used for analyzing the adaptive optimizer too, though the procedure of the analysis will not be the same as what we did in this study. Comparing the result with ours may reveal why we seem to get a different result between gradient descent and Adam. Even though our result may not be immediately applicable to Adam, we think that our theory still has the value as the first step to analyze the case including optimizer like Adam.\n\n\n> How can we search the \u201clargest possible\u201d inner loop learning rate? Should we still use grid-search or heuristic search? In that case, what is the implication/shortcut that this proposed guideline brings?\n\nThe key takeaway of our work is that you do not have to find the \u201coptimal pair of \\alpha and \\beta\u201d, which is unknown, to tune the learning rates. Rather, it is enough to \u201cidentify the largest possible \\alpha\u201d for MAML to converge. Since you just need to find a particular \\alpha, you can find the maximum possible \\alpha with the binary search algorithm which runs only in logarithmic time even in the worst case, for example. This does not take that much time because you do not have to wait until convergence to find the largest possible \\alpha.\n\n", "title": "Response 1"}, "SJeuGWtLjS": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "rJx4PXPnFr", "comment": "Dear Reviewer 3,\n\nThank you for your review. we would like to address your concern below.\n\n\n> It doesn\u2019t help that the criteria relies on the spectrum of the Hessian evaluated at a critical point, which of course is not known before convergence in non quadratic setting.

We also modified our manuscript in consideration of your other comments. We appreciate your insightful feedback. Though we modified our theory, we think that the implication from our theory itself is still useful and is not reduced by the modifications. We would like to respond to your comment one by one.\n\n\n> The paper assumes that training set is equal to test set and these sets do not change over iterations, which is essentially equivalent to assuming full gradient access; this is different from the stochastic setting of MAML.\n\nAs you point out, we do not consider the stochasticity of the data sampling from the same task, though task during training can be different from that for fine-tuning, or course. We discuss the averaged behavior of a simplified MAML throughout the training in the manuscript. Admitting that stochasticity of the data from the same task matters and it would be better to consider it to derive the condition for a more realistic case, looking at the average case still often tells us important implications as our theory predict the result of the experiment regardless of such a simplification. We believe that our research is a good first step to analyze the relationship between the inner learning rate \\alpha and the meta-learning rate \\beta further. As to the variability between tasks, we will respond later.\n\n\n> The \"necessary condition\" is derived in the case where there is only one task, and there is no discussion on generalizing to some other tasks. This means that the setting is too simplified so that it is not even a meta-learning setup.\n\nAs we mentioned, it was inaccurate to say that we derived the necessary condition for MAML to converge to minima and we changed the expression. We admit that the one-task setting is too simple to call MAML. As you comment, it is not any more multi-task learning. Yet, this simplification allows us to find the relationship between the inner learning rate and meta-learning rate and in the sense, this simplification is useful for researchers to acquire an intuitive understanding of how MAML works.\n\n\n> In the extension to multiple tasks, the paper derives \"sufficient conditions\" to a set of \"necessary conditions\" for convergence of MAML to local minima. This means that, if we consider the sets of events A = {convergence of MAML to local min}, B = {necessary conditions for A}, and C = {sufficient conditions for B}, A is a subset of B and C is a subset of B and nothing can be specified between A and C. In the extreme case, A and C may be even disjoint subsets of B. Thus, at least in theory, the conditions for multiple tasks do not tell us anything about convergence.\n\nWe admit that in the extreme case, A and C may be disjoint. Considering your point out, we altered A = {convergence of MAML to local min} to A\u2019 = {local convergence of a simplified MAML to local min from any point in the vicinity of local minimum}. Therefore, the \u201cnecessary condition\u201d we originally derived is the necessary and sufficient condition and the condition of multi-task setting is now the sufficient condition of A\u2019. Also, since we can talk about multi-task setting thanks to this modification, we are able to consider the variability between different tasks. We think that this grasps the essence of MAML as the conclusion of our theory is consistent with the experimental result.

It is more accurate to call our condition \u201ccondition of a simplified MAML\u201d in consideration of the approximation you pointed out as well.
