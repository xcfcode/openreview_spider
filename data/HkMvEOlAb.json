Specifically, we randomly assign a pseudo parent-class label to each observation which is then modified by applying the domain specific transformation associated with the assigned label. Generated pseudo observation-label pairs are subsequently used to train a neural network with Auto-clustering Output Layer (ACOL) that introduces multiple softmax nodes for each pseudo parent-class. Due to the unsupervised objective based on Graph-based Activity Regularization (GAR) terms, softmax duplicates of each parent-class are specialized as the hidden information captured through the help of domain specific transformations is propagated during training. Ultimately we obtain a k-means friendly latent representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the chosen transformation type impacts performance and helps propagate the latent information that is useful in revealing unknown clusters. Our results show state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised clustering tasks on MNIST, SVHN and USPS datasets, with the highest accuracies reported to date in the literature.", "keywords": ["representation learning", "unsupervised clustering", "pseudo supervision", "graph-based activity regularization", "auto-clustering output layer"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The reviewers concerns regarding novelty and the experimental evaluation have been resolved accordingly and all recommend acceptance.

Existing approaches perform the clustering on the extracted features from these datasets. However, this approach doesn\u2019t fit the proposed clustering technique in this paper, because transformations generating the pseudo classes are domain-specific and so they are directly applied on the input space. Therefore, generalizing the proposed clustering technique to these datasets requires an orthogonal challenge which we already identified as future work to study how to apply these domain-specific transformations that will present rich information for the clustering task at hand. \n\nIn response to the comments about novelty: \n\nWe don\u2019t think this comment \u2013 quote \u201cThis is not clear what is novel here since ACOL and GAR already exist. The novelty seems to be in the adaptation to GAR from the semi-supervised to the unsupervised setting with labels indicating if data have been transformed or not\u201d  reflects the reality as both methods ACOL and GAR are completely novel and this paper, if chosen for publication, will be the very first time they appear in peer-reviewed literature (a major reason why we chose ICLR).

MNIST and USPS datasets (hand-written digits) might be seen as simple datasets since the existing methods in the literature of clustering have already achieved very good performances on these two datasets. However, unlike for semi-supervised and supervised settings, SVHN (street view house numbers - more realistic) is still a difficult and unsolved problem for the clustering task. This difficulty might be hard to observe in the first version of our paper as we couldn't find a method reporting clustering performance on SVHN to compare our approach at the time of submission for ICLR 2018.\n\nIMSAT[1] is the previous state-of-art approach for clustering on  SVHN, which was very recently published on ICML 2017 (the reason we missed this method in the first version).

We just want to note that not using the Reuters dataset for the comparison is not due to its complexity or largeness but due to the requirement for a future work for generalizing our approach to other domains such as text categorization.

That is, 98.4 (0.4) for IMSAT vs. 98.32%(\u00b10.08) for our approach. But the SVHN dataset provides a more solid basis of comparison. While IMSAT achieves 57.3 (3.9) clustering accuracy on SVHN, our approach outperforms IMSAT by achieving 76.80%(\u00b11.30). I think it's also worth noting the mechanical differences between these two approaches. For example, while IMSAT uses 960-dimensional GIST features for SVHN, our approach employs raw pixels (32x32x3). Besides, IMSAT uses VAT based (or RPT based) regularization while we adopt graph-based regularization.\n\nI think citing this work will further be helpful for the evaluation of our approach, as it also provides the performances of other approaches (like DEC) on the SVHN dataset.\n\nThank you very much for your feedback.\n", "title": "Citing IMSAT and comparison"}}}
