The authors also show why the assumptions on the permissible functions can not be relaxed.\n\nQuality: the paper seems to be technically correct. However, the authors do not discuss any consequence of their result. Why was it important to prove it? What does it tell us about the networks? While the proof may be of interest to the authors of [14] to correct their (possible) mistakes, I think the paper will go under the radar for most people and thus encourage the authors to heavily revise the paper.\n\nClarity: the writing is clear in general. The proofs sometimes jump over non-trivial things and explain easy steps, but that maybe subjective. The paper spends no effort explaining the contribution and its consequences.\n\nOriginality: the proven statements are novel and extend/fix the claims of [14]\n\nSignificance: as said above, I believe that in the current form the paper will have little to no impact. The importance of proving the main statement under more general conditions on activation functions is doubtful and the authors do not comment on that.\n\nMinor comments:\n* when introducing T{i,:,:} the <> notation is not clear. I could guess it from the later usage of the symbol, but these brackets can mean a lot of things, e.g. bracket mean (Section 2.1)\n* it would be beneficial to define the main objects, wide-network limits, in a more formal way (Section 2.3)\n* how the wide regime (large N) is interesting for studying deep NNs? [14] discusses that to some extent, but this should be explained here as well\n* q_0 is never defined\n* it's good practice to add numbers to all equations\n* I believe the claim in the appendix of [14] was meant to be conditionally independent (see also the reviews of [14]). It's clear that preactivations should not be independent and, while technically interesting, spending a page of theorem 10 and on plots seems unnecessary. Even in the paper's example preactivations are uncorrelated in the limit of large N.\n* I don't see the point of having experiments in this paper. The authors have already proven the fact. Also, it is not clear how to read the plots (no axes, little description) and come to the statements from page 9.\n\n********************\nAfter the authors' response:\nIf the main motivation of the paper is to fix the mistakes in [14], then the paper should clearly state so, in addition to explaining why fixing is necessary. While I believe that pointing out other paper's mistakes and correcting them is important, the current state of the paper leads me to keeping my initial score and recommending to reject the paper.", "title": "Technically correct, not well-written", "rating": "4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "BJxmsF5kp7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HyeYsYKPh7", "comment": "We thank this reviewer for the valuable detailed suggestions regarding presentation.  Thanks also for pointing out the need to define q_0 before the statement of Theorem 2;  q_0 = 1.\n\nRegarding motivation, as we pointed out to Reviewer 1, the length map studied in our paper, itself published in NIPS\u201916, has been repeatedly applied in a long series of papers published in NIPS, ICLR and ICML; we provide a list in the fourth paragraph of our paper.  It is therefore noteworthy that the logic supporting this length map published in [14] is not valid, and the claim made about it in that paper is incorrect.  This then motivates the question of what similar statement is correct. \n\nWe have spoken to two of the authors of [14] about our findings, and neither of them claimed that they meant \u201cconditionally independent\u201d when they wrote \u201cindependent\u201d.  While, on a first reading, this claim in their paper struck us as highly implausible, we felt that it was necessary to prove our claim that their claim was incorrect.   The experiments illustrate the strength of some of the effects analyzed in our paper.\n\nYou are correct that, as N gets large, the dependence between pairs of preactivation values becomes weaker.  But then, when analyzing the next layer, there are competing effects: as N gets larger, the dependence between individual pairs of hidden nodes is approaching zero but the number of such interferences is approaching infinity, but the improved stability obtained by averaging more cases is improving.

Theorem 2, which is the main theoretical contribution of the paper, hinges on fixing the inputs of the neural network with weights sampled randomly from a Gaussian distribution. It is difficult to connect this with practice. This is not unreasonable and indeed common in mean-field analyses.
