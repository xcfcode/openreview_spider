They propose to decompose factors contributing to the risk into two, context bias and object error. Based on this interpretation, an algorithm is designed to 'greedily correct bias' while employing adversarial training (or robustness training) for 'local refinement'. The method achieves high accuracy on two synthetic visual tasks, digits and traffic sign classification, when a model is trained using one sample per class from the source domain and tested on an unseen target domain.\n\n+) Theorem 3.1 provides a new view on risk. Risk is decomposed into two factors, context bias and object error. I think this gives new insight to consider the effect of context bias and object modeling on risk separately.\n\n+) The experimental results are impressive because the model is trained using a very limited number of samples (one sample per class from the source domain) but showed high generalization performance on an unseen domain. The proposed method achieves promising performance on two synthetic classification tasks compared to other existing methods for few-shot learning and domain adaptation, which requires more labeled or unlabeled data during training.\n\n-) Their underlying assumption for greedy bias correction is that a classifier learns a strong bias on recent training inputs when taken as contexts.

Please let us know if there are any points that require further elaboration.\n\n>  The proposed method has a strict restriction: The training sets must have a single synthetic image for each object class with no additional information about the target domain. This may limit the training of the model in some hard conditions.\n\nIn fact, the only requirements for applying greedy bias correction are 1) a decomposition of the input space into object and context spaces, and 2) the ability to sample from the object and context spaces independently. In our heuristic, we suggest drawing samples from the object space uniformly at random; thus, it is straightforward to apply our techniques when there are multiple images (not necessarily synthetic) for each object class. Likewise, there is no restriction on using information from the target domain, though practically speaking, we argue that the ability of our approach to generalize even in absence of any target information is a significant strength of our approach.\n\n> The quality of the paper will be upgraded if the authors further investigate more data augmentation or style transfer methods in related work and ablation study. Since the context and object concepts are similar with the style and content in some GANs and transferring works\n\nThank you for the suggestion! Style transfer does seem conceptually related, though GANs still require a large amount of images to learn, so we don't think they can be applied in the setting of our experiments. Note that we already cite several GAN-based approaches for domain adaptation--if there are any specific suggestions we would be happy to include them in the discussion.\n\n> The experiments seem a little bit weak. The experiments are only conducted on two simple datasets, i.e. GTSRB and MINST.\n\nOur results actually include a third dataset, Omniglot, which is a standard dataset for few-shot learning. This task differs from MNIST in that there are 1623 character classes, each of which is drawn by the same 20 people; the general idea is that Omniglot is about learning many characters over a small set of handwritings, whereas MNIST is about learning a small set of characters over many different handwritings.\n\nThe datasets used for our experiments were selected because they very cleanly satisfy the theoretical assumptions of context-agnostic learning. In particular, we needed to be able to (1) produce uniform samples from the entire object space for training, and (2) have ground-truth segmentation of the object from the context for testing. These characteristics allow us to provide the results and ablation studies showing that, among other results:\n- classifiers trained using our method on synthetic datasets achieve both context-agnostic performance as well as generalization to the corresponding real datasets (Table 1)\n- classifiers trained using vanilla SGD on realistic datasets do not achieve context-agnostic performance (Figure 3)\n\nWe would to emphasize that this second point is the second main contribution of this work, independent of the proposed Greedy Bias Correction. Specifically, we formalize the objective for context agnostic learning (and prove Theorem 3.1 as motivation for our setting). We believe this view on risk delivers a theoretically rigorous framework for analyzing the extent to which classifiers depend on background signals. Indeed, our ablation results show that image classifiers trained using vanilla SGD on real-world images are very brittle to small changes in the background. We note that the images generated when measuring the context agnostic performance are, qualitatively, extremely reasonable (see Figure 7 in Appendix E.2). This is not a trivial result, and we believe our datasets are a good setting for our theoretical contributions.\n\n> The comparison with existing methods is insufficient.

Theorem 3.1 justifies our chosen formalisms by drawing a link between our setting and the standard notion of risk using the context bias. This permits us to reason about ways to achieve this learning objective, and design experiments to evaluate algorithms for this objective.\n\n> ... and how this setting can benefit the application in the real world? \n\nFor instance, the ablation studies show that classifiers trained using vanilla SGD on realistic datasets are surprisingly brittle to background signals (Table 3). This evaluation is well-defined, because we can measure against the objective of context-agnostic learning. We note that the images generated when measuring the context agnostic performance are, qualitatively, extremely reasonable (see Figure 7 in Appendix E.2).

For example, 7% lower than GCR on Omniglot. Can the authors explain the benefits of the proposed model please? \n\nThere are several benefits to our approach. The first is that we use significantly less data: only one sample of each class. For instance, our dataset for GTSRB consists of 43 images in total (whereas the standard training set contains 39,209 images). For Omniglot, we train using only the 20 (or 5) images in the test set. To the best of our knowledge, no other approach can be applied to this setting: both domain adaptation and few-shot learning (including GAN-based approaches) still require large amounts of training data. Thus, while a handful of other approaches achieve better test performance, our results are not directly comparable as the baseline approaches do so using significantly more data. \n\nSecond, we note in the ablation studies that our models exhibit much higher resilience to background signals than models trained using standard supervised methods (Figure 3). As the existing baselines for few-shot learning and domain adaptation are not trained for the context agnostic objective, we believe they would suffer similarly.\n\n> Also, I notice the authors mainly use two simple types datasets, traffic signs and hand-written characters, while I am expecting to see the performance on more realistic datasets, such as ImageNet. Can the authors explain why they choose these two types of datasets?\n\nWe selected datasets for which we could produce \"ground truth\" samples from the object space. This allows us a clean setting for both training our models, as well as measuring the context-agnostic performance. Note that none of the experiments in the paper use foregrounds separated from pre-existing training data; rather, we start with a single synthetic example of each class (e.g., for MNIST, we use a digit font; for GTSRB, we use the official, high-resolution images of each sign). \n\n> Are they easier to separate the context / background ?\n\nAs far as we know, automatic segmentation is an open problem and current approaches still suffer from inaccuracies and artifacts.

However, if stochastic gradient descent is used for optimization, I think it is unlikely because the model changes continuously. Therefore, it is uncertain how effective this greedy selection strategy can sample contexts with large bias.\n\nThe greedy bias correction heuristic aims to solve an optimization objective which is computational intractable in general, namely, identifying the context with the highest bias. We do not claim that our heuristic successfully identifies contexts with the \"largest\" bias, but we believe our experimental results support that our heuristic identifies contexts of \"sufficiently large\" bias. First, as noted we achieve good performance on real-world datasets, and the ablation studies show our heuristic gives much better generalization than randomly sampling from the context space. Second, in Figure 3 we validate the empirical context bias of various classifiers by fixing the foreground and varying the background. In particular, initialization using our bias heuristic gives a much stronger attack than a random initialization, even when the attack is unbounded, suggesting that the contexts returned by the bias heuristic are indeed closer to the optimum. \n\nRegarding the interaction of our heuristic with SGD, the contexts are continuously updated along with the model, so we're not sure why SGD should present a particular challenge (perhaps the reviewer can clarify this point?)\n\n> Relating to the above point, I also have a concern about the experimental validation.

We do not think this is a significant weakness however, as many types of noise manifest additively in the signal, particularly noise which arises from natural observations (e.g., the background of images, noise in audio clips, measurement noise for sensors, etc.). For instance, the Kalman filter is another example of a model that assumes additive noise, but this has not prevented it from being widely used (perhaps most famously in the navigation systems of manned missions to the moon).\n\n> Also, all the experiments are performed for a relatively small number of classes (up to 50), and synthetic images are small iconic images with objects in the center.

In my understanding, context bias is corrected by forcing a model trained using the opposite (or other) object class in the same context in the next training iteration. If it is correct, how can the bias be corrected just by training with other objects? Does it affect to reduce ||B(h,c)|| in Definition 3.3? Please clarify it.\n\nThe rationale behind our approach is covered at the end of Section 3.1. The naive method for controlling the bias with respect to Theorem 3.1 would be: for each training sample use the context of the current maximum bias, i.e., argmax_c ||B(h,c)||. Unfortunately, as we note, this optimization problem is computationally intractable in general. Our heuristic is based on the observation that the most recent training sample can be repurposed as a context of large bias for the next training sample. \n\nWe believe our experiments support this heuristic. First, we are able to generalize from synthetic to several real-world datasets, and our ablation studies show that this heuristic contributes significantly to achieving such performance (Figure 1).
