They free the network designers from the activation selection process and increase the test prediction accuracy.", "abstract": "The performance of deep network learning strongly depends on the choice of the non-linear activation function associated with each neuron. However, deciding on the best activation is non-trivial and the choice depends on the architecture, hyper-parameters, and even on the dataset. Typically these activations are fixed by hand before training. Here, we demonstrate how to eliminate the reliance on first picking fixed activation functions by using flexible parametric rational functions instead. The resulting Pad\u00e9 Activation Units (PAUs) can both approximate common activation functions and also learn new ones while providing compact representations. Our empirical evidence shows that end-to-end learning deep networks with PAUs can increase the predictive performance. Moreover, PAUs pave the way to approximations with provable robustness.", "keywords": []}, "meta": {"decision": "Accept (Poster)", "comment": "The paper proposed a new learnable activation function called Pad\u00e9 Activation Unit (PAU) based on parameterization of rational function.

The numerator and denominator of the learnable activation function are polynomials of m and n, respectively. The authors name them Pad\u00e9 activation units (PAUs).

The authors show, at best, marginal improvements over a variety of baselines including MNIST, fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, and Imagenet. The authors also show that pruning neurons with PAU units results in slightly better accuracy that pruning neurons with ReLU units.\n\nThe improvements over baselines shown were marginal and I do not think they warrant publication at this conference.

However, PAU matches the assumption  of Kidger et al.  [1] proof. More precisely. Kidger et al. show that under certain size constraints, networks using non-affine continuous functions, with a continuous nonzero derivative at some point are also universal approximators. We will include this in the camera-ready version.\n\nMoreover, (i)-(v) are covered by PAU. For (i) we refer to the universal approximator discussion above as well as in the paper. Since PAU is seemingless integrated with the differentiable learning stack, standard methods for avoiding vanishing gradients can be used, hence, (ii) is covered. To cover (iii), we introduce safe PAUs and refer also to [1]. (iv) is covered since we only have a small overhead of parameters. Moreover, due to Telgarsky (2017) and  other recent results on ResNets one can actually expect to require less parameters, but this is future work. Finally (v) is covered as demonstrated by our empirical results. We will put these arguments into the camera-ready version.

Although we intend to test PAUs on other tasks/architectures, we consider the comparisons to the baselines we have (including the experiments proposed by reviewer #3) as a good introduction for PAUs into the community.\n\nYou are right in that we do not have a proof for the safe version of PAUs presented in the paper, but we are equally interested in this topic, too. Consequently, we now tested another \u201csafe\u201d version of the form P(X)/(eps + |Q(X)|). This version can be proven to be a universal approximator via similar arguments as the general PAU. However, empirically this version turned out to be very unstable. Unfortunately, the existence and form of safe PAUs, does not necessarily tell us about the stability and optimization characteristics. Fortunately, there is an indirect way around this and we redirect you to our reply to reviewer #2 for a further discussion. \n\nThank you once again for your review.\n", "title": "Safe PAUs"}, "BkxfeQYBor": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "SkxMQumTKB", "comment": "We thank you for the time and comments.\n\nWe have a different, rather very positive perspective. We are proposing an activation function that helps practitioners to avoid the search for activation functions as done in [1], and replaces this by learning.  PAU can match the performance of or sometimes outperform even the best baselines, in some cases up to 2% better than common activation functions. For instance we are  boosting the performance of MobileNetV2, a CVPR 2018 state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, in contrast to previous work, PAU directly paves the way to provably robust deep learning (Croce et al., 2019). Nevertheless, we fully agree with the reviewer that the paper would be even stronger by comparing to more learnable activation functions such as SReLUs and APLs, so we implemented and ran some more experiments: \n\n\n                  MNIST_VGG        MNIST_LeNet\nSReLUs    $99.15 \\pm0.03$    $99.13 \\pm0.14$\nAPLs        $99.18 \\pm0.10$    $99.35 \\pm0.11$ \nPAU        $99.30 \\pm0.05$    $99.21 \\pm0.04$ \n\n                  FMNIST_VGG        FMNIST_LeNet\nSReLUs    $89.65 \\pm0.42$    $89.83 \\pm0.30$\nAPLs        $91.41 \\pm0.48$    $89.72 \\pm0.30$ \nPAU        $91.25 \\pm0.18$    $90.30 \\pm0.15$ \n\n\n                  CIFAR10_VGG        CIFAR10_MVNet      CIFAR10_RNet\nSReLUs    $92.66 \\pm0.27$    $94.03 \\pm0.11$    $95.24 \\pm0.13$\nAPLs        $91.63 \\pm0.13$    $93.62 \\pm0.64$     $94.12 \\pm0.36$\nRPAU        $92.50 \\pm0.09$    $94.82 \\pm0.21$     $95.34 \\pm0.13$ \n    \n\nAgain, of the 7 new experiments, PAU is better than APL in 5 of them, and better than SReLU in 6 of them. More experiments on DenseNet and ImageNet, are running, and we expect to have them before the rebuttal deadline is over. Hence, PAU\u2019s perspective on robust deep learning via rationalization gets even more interesting. Thanks for pushing us to run more experiments. We believe the experiments show that PAUs are indeed competitive and have a place among the learnable activation functions.\n\nWe will keep you posted.\n\n[1] P. Ramachandran, B. Zoph, and Q. V. Le.

Pade is a rational function, which is a ratio of two polynomials, and which can very well approximate any of the usually used activation functions while having only a few parameters that can be learned from data. Moreover, the authors identify five properties that an activation function should have, and either prove or empirically show that PAUs satisfy all of them, unlike some of the baselines. Additionally, since Pade approximation can have poles and be unstable, this work introduces safe PAUs, where the polynomial in the denominator is constrained to attain values greater than or equal to one. Since one of the suggested properties is that a function using a given activation function be a universal function approximator, the authors provide a sketch of a proof that PAUs do allow that. This proof applies only to the unsafe version of the PAU, and it is unclear whether it extends to the safe PAU---an issue that is not mentioned by the authors.\nFurthermore, the authors propose a stochastic version of PAU with noise injected into parameters, which allows regularization. The empirical evaluation is quite extensive, and the PAU is compared against nine baselines on five different architectures (LeNet, VGG, DenseNet, ResNet, MobileNet) on four different datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIfar10, ImageNet) for the classification task. The evaluation confirms that PAUs can match the performance of or sometimes outperform even the best baselines while the attained learning curves show that PAUs also lead to faster convergence of trained models. Finally, the authors demonstrate that (and provide intuition why) using PAUs allow for high-performing pruned models.\n\nI recommend ACCEPTing this paper as it is well written, extensively evaluated, and provides performance improvements or at least matches the performance of the best baseline across several datasets and model architectures.\n\nMy only two suggestions for improvement are a) make the universal approximation proof tighter by making sure that it extends to the safe PAU version, and b) evaluate the proposed activation function on tasks other than just classification.", "title": "Official Blind Review #1", "rating": "8: Accept", "confidence": 2}}}
