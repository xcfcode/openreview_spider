The NLP literature is abundant with interesting work on label noise and should obviously be considered related work.

Specifically, Song et al. train a residual network with a large learning rate and use the resulting losses to separate the clean examples from mislabeled ones, based on some identifying examples that exceed a threshold. Our work, in contrast, does not attempt to separate clean labels from noisy ones but instead simply trains the network on the noisy examples. \n\nFunction of learning rates: In order to address this, we performed additional experiments on ResNet18 with smaller and larger learning rates, relative to the learning rate we choose initially. Initially, we choose the default learning rate/schedule which starts at 0.1 and decays every 30 epochs. We did experiments starting from 0.05 and 0.02 and found that it changes the rate at which the training set is fitted, but not the general behavior of the curves, performance, or necessity of early stopping.\n\nRegarding under what conditions early stopping prevents memorizing bad labels: Our numerical results show that standard neural networks such as ResNet, Shake-Shake, VGG, DenseNet, and others do not memorize the data if trained for a few epochs (see Fig. 2, showing that after a few epochs only the clean labels are fitted, but not the noisy ones). We do, however, not have formal conditions stating under which conditions data is not memorized, and we are also not aware of such conditions in the literature. \n\nRegarding whether the claims hold beyond classification, e.g., for object detection or segmentation: We do not know the extent to which this claim continues to holds, but suspect that the general insight that the network imposes sufficient structure to learn from noisy labels continues to hold for other domains/problems. A concrete example where this is true is image denoising: As first shown by Ulyanov et al. ``  `  deep image prior'', a convolutional network fits a natural image faster than noise and thus enables denoising by early stopping. This is conceptually similar to what we find albeit for a different problem (image denoising) vs. learning from noisy labels.\n", "title": "Response to review 3"}, "rkxPGAL2jB": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HyxyyOuBqr", "comment": "Thanks for the review and for acknowledging that the connection between early stopping and fitting true label distributions before noisy ones is of potential impact. In our revision, we provide experiments on another dataset in order to further justify our findings and to address the reviewers concerns.\n\nRegarding context/references:\n- We fully agree that noisily collected labels are common for many problems other than image classification. However, the focus of our paper is image classification, and we thus concentrate on classification problems related to the widely popular CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification problems. For the CIFAR-10 classification problem, it has not shown before that learning from candidate examples only is possible.\n- Thanks for bringing the paper by Plank, Hovy, and Sogaard to our attention. While a very interesting work, we do not see a connection to our work since Plank, Hovy, and Sogaard focus on NLP and incorporating measured inter-annotator agreement in the loss function. In contrast, we consider image classification and leverage the inductive bias of neural networks to learn from noisy candidate labels by early stopping. There is no mention of fitting examples slow or fast in the Plank, Hovy, and Sogaard paper.\n- Yes, we have also performed experiments with l2 regularization, but without early stopping cannot replicate our results with simply L2 regularization. Please note that our results rely on convolutional networks fitting clean labels faster than noisy ones, so early stopping is a natural way to exploit this property, while L2 regularization is not.\n- On cost-sensitive learning of systematic disagreements: This is a topic of the Plank, Howey, and Sogaard paper but not of our paper, since in our paper we do have noisy data, but no disagreements between labelers (because our data is not labeled by explicit labelers).\n- The observation that clean examples are fitted faster than noise is not related to active learning.\n\nExperimental details:\n- We fully agree with the downsides of using a search engine to collect labels pointed out by the reviewer. However, both the collection of CIFAR and ImageNet, the arguably most accepted datasets for image classification, are based on using search engines for data collection. The reproducibility of our results is not compromised by using the TinyImages dataset, because this dataset is publicly available and because we made our code available.\nRegarding reporting results only for a single dataset: In order to show that our findings extend to other datasets, we have performed an additional experiment on a subset of ImageNet and a candidate dataset that we have collected on Flickr. The results, reported in our revised paper, confirm our finding that early stopping enables learning from a candidate data set.\n- Regarding error analysis: we have added a section in the appendix showing the accuracy per class for both i) training on the candidate dataset and ii) the original CIFAR training set. The results show that the model trained on the candidate examples has a higher accuracy for every single class compared to the model trained on the original CIFAR-10 training set. \n- We did perform an experiment on a synthetic noisy dataset that directly evaluates the hypothesis that true labels are fitted faster than noise, please see Figure 4, right panel. There, we have flipped about half of the labels and the results show that the clean labels are fitted faster than the noisy ones (otherwise the test accuracy would not go first up and then drop significantly). We would also like to point out that our objective is to skip the expensive labeling step by directly training on the candidate labels. The real noise is a natural bi-product of such constructed datasets. \n- Please note that we cannot present confusion matrices as in the aforementioned paper by Plank, Hovy, and Sogaard, since we have a different setup and error mode: Our error mode is that an image does not belong to the class it is labeled with, but also not to one of the other classes (see Section 5 where we explain this).\n", "title": "Response to review 4"}, "H1x3TdB6Fr": {"type": "review", "replyto": "HJeIX6EKvr", "review": "Summary\n\nThe paper exploits the training dynamics of deep nets: gradient descent fits clean labels much faster than the noisy ones, therefore early stopping resembles training on the clean labels. The paper shows that early stopping the training on datasets with noisy labels can achieve classification performance higher than when training on clean labels (on condition that the total number of clean labels in the noisy training set is sufficiently large).\n\nThe paper also makes the point that noise introduced during data collection are different from artificially generated noise through randomly flipping the labels of a clean dataset. The latter is often done in the literature. The \u201creal\u201d noise is more structured and therefore it is easier to fit and less harmful to the classification performance.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe paper is well written. The results are very interesting even though they are very intuitive and simple.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe idea seems to be known.

As shown by the above paper, it is also a function of the learning rate. Please comment on what happens in the case of small learning rate and early stopping.\n\nIt would have been great to prove the theorem for deep learning. The result is limited to linear models with large number of random features.\n\nThe paper does not make it clear under what conditions early stopping prevents the model from memorizing bad labels.\n\nThe paper focuses on classification.
