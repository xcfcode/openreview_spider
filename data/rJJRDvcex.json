Baseline-CNN added containing only convolutional layers.\n\nThe following are the response to all reviewers on the common points:\n\n---- All the reviewers comment on the very good paper by Bell et al. We address those points here.\n\nReviewer 1:\n* Idea somewhat incremental (e.g. can be seen as derivative from Bell 2016).\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Regarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016). There are a few technical differences (e.g. cascading versus applying in parallel the recurrent layers), but in my understanding these are minor changes. The idea of initializing the recurrent network with the CNN is reasonable but is at the level of improving one wrong choice in the original work of Bell, rather than really proposing something novel.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* Contributions relative to, e.g. Bell et al., are minor.\n\nResponse:\nIn our paper, the proposed L-RNN module aims to be general; it can be inserted at any stage in the architectures for capturing contextual information at multiple levels.\n\nTo be clear on the differences:\n\n1. Interleaving CNN with L-RNN modules:\nIn Bell et al., the spatial RNNs are applied on top of CNN features (VGG-net) to learn contextual information at the final stage. A similar idea was also proposed in ReSeg (Visin et al. 2016).\nOur paper goes further than Bell et al. or Visin et al. by interleaving the CNN and LRNN modules at multiple levels of the network.\nIn consequence, the network is capable of learning representations from both local and larger context at every layer, alleviating the limitations of a fixed kernel size.\n \n2. How L-RNNs are inserted and initialized:\nUnder the scenario when the amount of data is limited, e.g. detection in Bell et al, semantic segmentation in our case.\nIn Bell et al., the authors take pre-trained CNN networks (VGG-16 up to conv5), and then train spatial RNNs on top of the pre-computed features.\nIn contrast, we show that a L-RNN can be directly inserted and trained within existing convolutional layers. This means that we increase the representational power of the pre-trained model directly. All layers in the pre-trained networks can therefore be adapted efficiently.\n\nIn our case, we re-purpose several layers in the pre-trained network as L-RNN modules at multiple levels, e.g. after pool3, pool4, and the final fully connected layers. As a result, we get a performance boost of 5% (mean IOU).\n \n3. Choice of RNNs.\nIn Bell et al., to avoid computational cost, the authors choose to use ReLU-based vanilla RNN (rather than GRU or LSTM).\nIn our paper, we validate this choice by showing that vanilla RNN with Layer Normalization (Ba et al. 2016) achieves similar performance to GRU.\n \n4. Separable Convolutions:\nIn Bell et al., 4 bidirectional spatial RNNs are applied to learn the global context. While in our paper, we propose to use 2, each bidirectional spatial RNNs is learning to approximate 1D convolutions, this idea comes from separable convolution.\n\n---- Comments on CIFAR classification experiments.\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Furthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16) report  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant). \nSo, the authors answer: \"Wide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth). Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information. In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.\"\n \n* So, we agree that WRN do not need recurrence - and can still do better.\nThe point of my question has practically been whether using a recurrent layer is really necessary; I can understand the answer as being \"yes, if you want to keep your network shallow\".  I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* One additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN. It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much. In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.\n \nResponse:\nHere is a short summary of the discussion part of the CIFAR experiments (now included in  the updated paper).\n\nThe L-RNN module is a general computational module; it is not our intention to replace the deep networks (e.g. residual variants). \n\n1. Why only use shallow networks?\nIt is well known that deep networks can generally achieve better results than shallow ones. Thus, in our experiments, we use relatively shallow networks to avoid the possibility that the performance gain is due to network depth. Our experiments confirm that increasing the network depth by only adding low-level CNN modules below a L-RNN improves the results (Table 2, Network A to D)\n\n2. Interleaving L-RNN with CNN modules.\nWe show a comparison between a Baseline-CNN and Network-E in Table 2. Baseline-CNN is composed of 7 convolutional layers with 1.56M parameters, it achieves 8.48% top1 error. While the Network-E interleaved with CNN and L-RNN modules contains 0.97M parameters, achieving 5.96% top1 error. The difference between them is the added LRNN modules.\nMoreover, by adding more layers, Network F(5.39% top1 error) achieves comparable performance to ResNet-164 (5.46%). \n\n---- Questions related to ImageNet.\n\nReviewer 2:\n* Regarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept.\n* Probably an evaluation on imageNet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* Classification experiments are not convincing.\n* I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too). The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks. ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks. Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features. However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other tasks (e.g., detection).\n \nResponse:\nFurther experiments on ImageNet are definitely on the top list of our future work.\n\n---- Comments on Training Details.\n \nReviewer 1:\n* Section 5.2.1 (and appendix A), how is the learning rate increased and decreased? Manually ? This is an important detail that should be made explicit. Is the learning rate schedule the same in all experiments of each table? If there is a human in the loop, what is the variance in results between \u201ctwo human schedulers\u201d?\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Appendix A: this is very mysterious. Did you try other learning rate schedules? (e.g. polynomial)\n \nResponse:\nThe important message here is that restarting the learning rate several times can help the networks to escape saddle points or local minima.\nWe only experiment with the stepwise decay (no polynomial), and change the learning rate every 40, 60 or 80 epochs, we did not find much difference on this detail.\nWe only provide the intuitive explanation because it is not the main focus of this paper, it is just a training trick. If the readers are interested in this, we found two other related papers in this ICLR submission.\n\nhttps://openreview.net/forum?id=Skq89Scxx\nhttps://openreview.net/forum?id=BJYwwY9ll", "title": "Response to All Reviewers on Common Points"}, "SJgo0F68x": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "B13xt9b4x", "comment": "Thank you very much for your comments, we have updated the paper and posted a common clarification.\n\nThe clarification and updated paper should solve the questions mentioned here.\n", "title": "Response"}, "rkCC6FaUg": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "ryeRthbEl", "comment": "We have posted a common clarification for all the reviewers.

As shown in the Table 3, the FCN-8s with 4096 channels(no L-RNN) in the fully connected layer has a similar number of parameters to the FCN-8s with 2048 channels(LRNN added). The comparison of performance is 64.4% vs. 69.1% on the validation set. Clearly, the performance gain is from the recurrence, not from the increased number of parameters.\n\n2. As shown in the CIFAR-10 classification experiments, Network-E (0.97M parameters) achieves much better performance than the Baseline-CNN (1.56M parameters).\n \n** Another thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that \"when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. \"\nThis is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)\n \nResponse: \nWhat we mean here is that even without inserting L-RNN, the receptive field for the fully connected layer in FCN-32s is already over 200 pixels. Given such a big receptive field already, inserting L-RNN modules to these fully connected layers does not help much (less context can be contributed here).\nTherefore, we add L-RNN modules to the low-level features (pool3 and pool4) in FCN-8s, hoping to capture bigger contextual information in the low-level layers, and we do see performance improvements (64.1 to 69.1 mean IOU).\n \nWe have added discussion on this in the updated paper.", "title": "Response to Specific Comments"}, "B12QOTe4g": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "Hkz_xck7x", "comment": "Thank you very much for your comments. \n\nWe are glad that the reviewers recognize the two principal contributions of the paper: (i) that L-RNN modules can be interleaved with CNN modules to increase the receptive field without a significant increase in parameters, and trained end-to-end from scratch (and we demonstrate this for classification); and (ii) that L-RNNs can be inserted into a pre-trained CNN and then trained to improve performance (and we demonstrate this for a FCN (VGG-type) for segmentation).\n\n1. Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16)\nreport  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant) - can you comment?\n\nWide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth). Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information. In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.\n\n2 . Is the boost you are obtaining due to something special to the recurrent layer, or is simply because one is adding extra parameters on top of a pre-trained network? (I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)\n\nThere are two cases: (i)  For CIFAR-10 classification, we are not using any pre-trained networks, we train the whole network end-to-end with L-RNN built on top of CNNs - so the boost is only because of the L-RNN, and the something special is global context. (ii) For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences.\n\n3. The results on PASCAL look really promising - but it would also be good to know what is the boost one can expect to get for semantic segmentation when using a strong baseline, such as Deeplab V2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915) where the performance is reaching 80% on VOC.\nIt would also be interesting to compare the recurrent processing layer's complementarity to the Atrous SPP context aggregation proposed there. \n\nYes, we agree that is an investigation we should do. In this paper, we chose to insert L-RNNs directly into a pre-trained VGG-type network, aiming to provide an initial insight on how the learnt contextual information can improve the baseline VGG-type network. Then, our future work, will be to insert these modules into other state-of-the-art networks, including the ResNets variants.\n\n4. Finally, regarding the recurrent part, this seems to me similar to the network of Bell 2016; if the difference consists in cascading the L-R/T-D flows, rather than doing them in parallel, could you comment on whether this is better or worse performance-wise?\n(I understand that these are now being used as Residual Layers, which was not the case before).\n\nOur motivation is similar to the work by Bell 2016, to model contextual features with Recurrent Neural Networks in a flexible way. However, several distinguishing points are worth noting.\n-- To model the contextual information reaching whole image level, cascading the L-R/ T-D flows should be enough. Comparing with doing them in parallel, ours use fewer parameters.\n-- We treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of modern architectures, such as a residual module.\n-- Instead of using the identity recurrence matrix, we train them.\n-- We treat CNNs as a special case of Spatial Recurrent Neural Networks. Our observation is that standard RNNs compute responses based on two terms, a local term and a recurrence term. CNNs can be formalized as exactly the RNNs without the recurrence term. CNNs were designed with fixed receptive fields at each spatial position within a layer, while the added recurrence is able to model contextual information. Since CNNs have already proved to work very well on various tasks, we can always keep the CNN weights unchanged, and treat them as the local term in RNNs, then insert the recurrence term directly and train this. This formulation and method of training were not apparent in Bell et al.\n", "title": "regarding recurrent layer"}, "Hkz_xck7x": {"type": "review", "replyto": "rJJRDvcex", "review": "One general question relates to the necessity of the recurrent processing. \n\nWide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16)\nreport  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant) - can you comment?\nIs the boost you are obtaining due to something special to the recurrent layer, or is simply because one is adding extra parameters on top of a pre-trained network?

(I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)\"\nThe answer was:\n\"...For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences\"\nI could not find one such experiment in the paper ('more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers'); I understand that you have 2048 x 2048 connections for the recurrence, it would be interesting to see what you get by spreading them over (non-recurrent) residual layers.\nClearly, this is not going to be my criterion for rejection/acceptance, since one can easily make it fail - but I was mostly asking for some sanity check \n\nFurthermore, it is a bit misleading to put in Table 3 FCN-8s and FCN8s-LRNN, since this gives the impression that the LRNN gives a  boost by 10%. In practice the \"FCN8s\" prefix of \"FCN8s-LRNN\" is that of the authors, and not of Long et al (as indicated in Table 2, 8s original is quite worse than 8s here). \n\nAnother thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that \"when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. \"\nThis is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)\n\nA few additional points: \nIt seems like Fig 2b and Fig2c never made it into the pdf. \n\nFigure 4 is unstructured and throws some 30 boxes to the reader - I would be surprised if anyone is able to get some information out of this (why not have a table?) \n\nAppendix A: this is very mysterious. Did you try other learning rate schedules? (e.g. polynomial)\nWhat is the performance if you apply a standard training schedule? (e.g. step). \nAppendix C: \"maps .. is\" -> \"maps ... are\"\n\n\n", "title": "regarding recurrent layer", "rating": "6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "H1aJApzMx": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "HySyOhyMx", "comment": "1.
