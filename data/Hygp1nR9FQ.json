Many effective algorithms exist to craft these adversarial examples, but performant defenses seem to be far away. In this work,  we explore the use of edge-aware bilateral filtering as a projection back to the space of natural images. We show that bilateral filtering is an effective defense in multiple attack settings, where the strength of the adversary gradually increases. In the case of adversary who has no knowledge of the defense, bilateral filtering can remove more than 90% of adversarial examples from a variety of different attacks. To evaluate against an adversary with complete knowledge of our defense, we adapt the bilateral filter as a trainable layer in a neural network and show that adding this layer makes ImageNet images significantly more robust to attacks. When trained under a framework of adversarial training, we show that the resulting model is hard to fool with even the best attack methods.

We would like to reiterate that BFNet is still significantly better than the ImageNet filtering defense [2], tested in [1]. Using the L2 normalization in [2], the numbers in our Table 7 translate to (0.091, 0.091), and  (0.055, 0.062) for Inception V3 and InceptionResNet V2 respectively. Which is significantly better than the considered filtering defenses, which failed under a perturbation of 0.01 against a BPDA adversary. Our approximate L-BFGS uses a finite-difference method to provide the gradient, which is a BPDA strategy to attack BFNet. Hence we are at least 5x - 6x more robust than the other analyzed ImageNet defenses. We will clarify this and provide the comparison using comparable numbers in the final version.\n\nFrom that result and our performances in adversarial training, we believe we are clearly better than state-of-the-art, which we believe should be achieving the standard for a paper to be published.\n\n[1] Athalye, Anish, Nicholas Carlini, and David Wagner. \"Obfuscated gradients give a false sense of security: Circumventing defenses to adversarial examples.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.00420 (2018).\n\n[2] Guo, C., Rana, M., Cisse, M., and van der Maaten, L.

We have made revisions to our manuscript, and we will answer outstanding questions here. \n\nQuestion: Epsilon values from Table 4 are way too high and the paper should consider finite-difference based attacks such as SPSA and other black box attacks. \n\nAnswer: We appreciate the point brought forward by the BPDA paper, that gradient masking is often the cause of a defense that looks good on the outside yet is easily broken, and we agree with the reviewer that those experiments are needed. \n\nTo this end, we performed two black box tests on the non-adversarially trained ImageNet models InceptionResNet-V2 and Inception-V3 (corresponding to Table 4). We report the results in the updated appendix of the paper. For both attacks, we used the implementation given in the Foolbox toolbox. The results are found in table 7. \n\nFirst, we used the Boundary attack from [1]: a decision-based attack that begins with a large adversarial perturbation, then reduces the magnitude of the perturbation while retaining an adversarial label. This attack has been shown to be effective and scale to high dimensional inputs. \nSecond, we used an approximate L-BFGS attack where the gradients are computed numerically. Using a numerical gradient avoids the instabilities in iterative attacks which occur in gradient-masking defenses. \n\nFrom the results given, we can see the BFNet does well against both the decision-based attack and the approximate L-BFGS, showing that it is indeed resistant to such kind of attacks as well. \n\nQuestion: How is adversarial training adapted to BFNet (Sec. 3.4)? Is it applied to the image after applying the bilateral filter?\nAnswer: Adversarial training is performed on the entire BFNet, including the bilateral filtering layer, which means the gradient goes through the bilateral filter and goes to the original image before the bilateral filtering layer. We have cleared the notations in the paper.\n\nQuestion: Adaptive filtering is a weak defense and should be removed\n We used adaptive filtering as a motivation to BFNet -- showing that a plain BF with parameter selection can defeat many adversarial examples, but insufficient because it reduces accuracy and can be brittle. It is indeed less capable than the manual filtering, or BFNet. We are open to explicitly mention that or removing this part from the paper if there is a consensus that it\u2019s not needed.\n\nQuestion: In Table 6, what is the performance of BFNet without adversarial training?\n- Without adversarial training, we can only fine-tune the parameters of the vanilla network to adapt to the bilateral filter. - At first, the accuracy is quite poor. But with fine tuning with 10 epochs, BFNet with both classifiers (InceptionResNet-V2 and Inception-V3) lose only 5% accuracy on the ImageNet test set. We will include this metric in the final paper. \n\nQuestion: Why are ImageNet results significantly better than MNIST and CIFAR?\nWe believe the answer to this question is that bilateral filtering is a much more sound approach in high-resolution images such as ImageNet than low-resolution ones such as MNIST and CIFAR. In the 32x32 resolution in MNIST and CIFAR, a bilateral filter can only be very narrow to perform well, otherwise, it would easily distort the image significantly to kill the signal on the original class. On the other hand, with the high resolution in ImageNet, we can perform a significant amount of bilateral filtering (in terms of both the width and range) without destroying the content of the image, hence the defense effect would be significantly higher than in low-resolution images.\n\n[1] Brendel, Wieland, Jonas Rauber, and Matthias Bethge. \"Decision-based adversarial attacks: Reliable attacks against black-box machine learning models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.04248 (2017).\n", "title": "Reply"}, "H1ego31qC7": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "r1lkHf8U37", "comment": "We appreciate the point brought forward by the BPDA paper, that gradient masking is often the cause of a defense that looks good on the outside yet is easily broken and agree with the reviewer that those experiments are needed. \n\nTo this end, we performed two black box tests on the non-adversarially trained ImageNet models InceptionResNet-V2 and Inception-V3 (corresponding to Table 4).

We wish to address them below, as well as in the revision of our paper. \n\nQuestion 1: The numbers in Table 1 should be compared with the %-age of examples that were actually fooled.\n- 100% of the adversarial examples considered in Table 1 fooled the network. We have already excluded failed adversarial attacks beforehand. We have made this more clear in the revision.\n\nQuestion 2: Are the results in the column titled 'clean' pertaining to when natural (unperturbed images) are filtered and tested? If not, then what are the accuracy values in that case.\n- In table 3, the column labeled \u201cclean\u201d refers to the top1 and top5 accuracy of the networks with adaptive filtering, where each incoming image (including natural unperturbed ones) is filtered with the predicted parameters. \n\n\nQuestion 3-5: In Table 2-3 why does diversion to a new category make sense? What are the relationships between Table 2 and 3?\n- In table 2, we considered the threat model where an attacker wants an ML system to give a specific output. In this case, it is enough to destroy the targeted perturbations created by the attack to foil the attacker. In other cases (like autonomous vehicles) we are interested in the correct label above all else, we report results for recovering the correct label in table 3. \n\n\nQuestion 6: With adaptive filtering, the accuracy of natural/clean images consistently and significantly drops, why?\n- The accuracy drop for using adaptive filtering is due to adaptive filtering not being a powerful enough method to detect adversarial examples. It can reliably assign filtering parameters which may improve robustness, but this comes at a cost of potentially destroying discriminant features. The fact that adaptive filtering does not have the classification accuracy we expect is partially what leads us to a more end-to-end solution like BFNet.\n\n\nQuestion 7: How are larger perturbations less adversarial \u2013 especially when a human can still correctly classify the perturbed images?\n- We agree that notions of \u2018adversarialness\u2019 being tied to human perception are vague. We have removed these comments from the manuscript. It is although a common standard in most papers to measure adversarial examples based on the L_2 or L_infty norm of the perturbations, which we adopt as well.\n\nQuestion 8: The numbers of Table 5 is fooling rate which is inconsistent with every other table.\n- We have converted the natural column from error rate % to accuracy in the manuscript. \n", "title": "Reply"}, "S1lSIkGThQ": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Hygp1nR9FQ", "review": "The paper proposes the use of bilateral filtering as a defense to adversarial examples (AE). Bilateral Filtering (BF) is a smoothening technique that averages pixels that are close to each other both in position and value. As a result BF preserves sharp edges and the denoised images appear to be of higher quality than those produces via simple Gaussian smoothing.\nFirst, the method is evaluated on black-box attacks by constructing AE for the undefended network and then applying the defense. The method is then tested on white-box attacks which attack the defended system end-to-end with first order methods. Finally, the authors propose combining their defense with adversarial training.\n\nOverall, I find the main idea of the paper interesting. BF seems like a natural approach to remove low-magnitude perturbations from the image while preserving the salient characteristics of the image. Thus, if it did not hurt classification accuracy significantly it might be considered as part of a cheap preprocessing pipeline that protects the model from simple attacks. However, as shown in Table 3 and 6, BF reduces the accuracy of the original model by at least 5% on ImageNet and CIFAR10.\n\nMy main objection about the paper is that BF is proposed as a defense that is extremely robust against even the best attacks. However, the evaluation is clearly incomplete for such a claim and fails to pass simple sanity checks.\n\n*Epsilon values used to claim robustness are way too high*. Table 4 reports an L_infinity bound of 0.793 (almost 40% the image range) and L_2 of 187 (again roughly a quarter of the L2 radius of the image domain). One can change the class of the image completely (even for humans) with a smaller epsilon bound. This is a very clear indication that the attacks used are not sufficient to properly evaluate the robustness of the defense. Even in the images produced by the authors (Figure 2) it is clear that these perturbations are sufficient in terms of magnitude to completely distort the image.\n\n*Only first-order attacks are considered*. From the point about epsilon values above, it is fairly clear that the defense is not easy to attack with first-order methods. This is understandable since BF, even if \"fully differentiable\", will lead to vanishing gradients for certain pixels. I think it is necessary that the authors to evaluate their defense on other attacks such as a) a straight-through approximation of BF (see BPDA from https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00420), b) a finite-differences-based attack (see SPSA from https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05666). As a sanity check, I would even recommend evaluating using the nearest neighbor of each image from a wrong class. It is clear that this attack will always succeed and the L_p distance will be smaller than those reported here.\n\nI believe that these are fundamental issues about the paper that need to be addressed before even considering the paper for acceptance and I thus recommend rejection at this time.\n\nOther comments and concerns:\n--Table 6: what is the performance of BFNet without adversarial training? This is a necessary baseline to understand the results of the table.\n\n-- I am confused by the adaptation of adversarial training to BFNet (last equation of section 3.4). The equations themselves are confusing since x is used twice (as a parameter to f and sampled from D). My first guess would be that the method is performing end-to-end adversarial training from the loss to the input x (before BF). It appears however that adversarial training is performed with respect to the image *after* applying the BF filter. If this is the case, it goes against the fundamental principles of adversarial training.\n\n-- I do not see the point of adaptive filtering (AF) as a defense. BF is attractive because it is simple. Adding a classifier to figure out the right parameters seems dubious at best. The idea seems fundamentally flawed given that the classifier is only trained on known attacks and might thus not capture new, different attacks. Lastly, since the classifier is a ML model, it will clearly be susceptible to adversarial perturbations. So the adversary can choose an attack that fools the original model and forces the classifier to choose bad BF parameters. I would suggest that the authors completely remove AF from future versions of their paper.\n\n-- The performance on ImageNet is significantly better than the performance on MNIST and CIFAR10. This is counter-intuitive since a much harder dataset both from a standard and adversarial point of view.\n\nMinor comments to authors:\n-- A JPEG compression-based defense can be bypassed (https://machine-learning-and-security.github.io/papers/mlsec17_paper_54.pdf).\n-- Last paragraph of page 3 is too informal (\"less holes for adversarials to maneuver on\").\n-- Top of page 4: you seem to confuse \"iterative methods\" with \"small magnitude\" attacks. One can use iterative attacks to create large adversarial perturbations (e.g. PGD).\n-- I would suggest normalizing to the more common [0, 1] range as the current numbers can be confusing.\n-- I am confused by Tables 2, 3. First row of Table 2 shows that on 95% of the clean inputs the label is not changed after BF. But table 3 shows that the accuracy drop from 78.8% to 71.7%. What is going on here?\n-- Last part of first paragraph of 4.2 is hard to understand.\n-- End of page 8, \"the higher dimensionality of CIFAR10 makes it harder than MNIST\".

The numbers in Table 1 should be compared with the %-age of examples that were actually fooled to begin with by using each adversarial attack scheme under study. Only then can the recovery performance of the hand-tuned bilateral filtering be put into perspective.\n2. In case of the adaptive filtering method, the parameters for bilateral filtering are predicted by a standalone classifier. For the experiments to be fair, any incoming image, whether adversarially perturbed or not, must be filtered using the parameters predicted by the classifier. Thus, are the results in the column titled 'clean' pertaining to when natural (unperturbed images) are filtered and tested? If not, then what are the accuracy values in that case.\n3. Also in Table 2, the case (B) measures the ability of the adaptive filtering to change the predicted label from the adversarial label to a 'new' one.  In this case, it is important to measure/verify whether the 'new' label is benign or malignant (which may well depend on the specific task of classification and the semantic associations of the output classes). Without this analysis for the 'new' class, it seems irrelevant and even misleading to quote this measure.\n4. It is unclear what the relation between the results in Table 2 and Table 3 is. How are the values in the two tables linked, if at all?\n5. In Table 3., once again, what does 'clean' column report? Are the natural images adaptively filtered and then tested for accuracy? If not, then do also report those numbers in a separate column. \n6. It is really evident in Table 3 that as the adaptive filtering is applied and the robustness seems to improve (as measured in terms of the accuracy figures for the various attack schemes), the accuracy for natural/clean images consistently and significantly drops. There has not been discussed anywhere in the paper. What does this imply? It should be highlighted in text and maybe even graphically, plotting the tradeoff between robustness gain (on adversarial images) and accuracy loss (on clean images). \n7. Some claims in the paper are unsubstantiated: (a) 2nd para, pg 7 - an adversarial detector or a human eye would be able to detect those attacks. Do the authors have any quantitative figures to share on how well a detector or human subjects would fare at this task? (b) Larger perturbations are visually discernible and thus less adversarial? Again, from the images in row 2, fig2, one can notice that there is a higher quotient of noise but this doesn't in any way interfere with the recognisability of those images by a human. How are they less adversarial when humans are not affected by the perturbations as concerns the classification task?\n8. What does the column title 'natural' in Table 5 correspond to, especially as it is a subcolumn of an attack scheme? Also, the numbers in Table 5 seem to be the fooling rates. This is inconsistent with the remaining tables where accuracies are being presented. Do you think it would be better to convert these to accuracy figures too?\n\nI am interested in knowing the authors' responses on the above points before I can propose my final rating.", "title": "The paper is well written, however some experimental results are incomplete/unclear and discussion is lacking", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"}, "r1lkHf8U37": {"type": "review", "replyto": "Hygp1nR9FQ", "review": "The paper addresses the robustness of deep neural networks to adversarial example attacks.
