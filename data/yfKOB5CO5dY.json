The proposed approach doesn't follow the episodic training, so there exists a clear difference from advanced MAML approaches, which update the task-specific parameters in the episodic training.

Conceptually, this approach is very similar to previous ones:\n* Meta-learning with latent embedding optimization, ICLR\u201919.\n* Gradient-Based Meta-Learning with Learned Layerwise Metric and Subspace, ICML\u201918.\n\nBoth propose data-dependent parameter generative processes, in which a subset of parameters is used to solve the input task. But, the proposed approach has not been compared to them.\n\nThe proposed method has been validated in very limited few-shot classification scenarios (only 5-way 50-shot tasks). It\u2019s necessary to consider more standard experiments settings. I guess 1-shot / 5-shot on miniImagenet and tieredImagenet tasks should be included in experiments. Otherwise, it\u2019s very difficult to see that this approach works well in general settings. \n\nFor few-shot classification tasks, there exist many attempts to improve the performance. But, none of these approaches has not been compared to the proposed method. More empirical justification is needed.", "title": "This paper naturally extends PAC-Bayesian analysis to construct a task-adaptive hyperprior, but its empirical justification is not strong.", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"}, "5eiSF3WID3j": {"type": "review", "replyto": "yfKOB5CO5dY", "review": "----------Updates after rebuttal------------\n\nThe author did not provide a revised version and additional experiments to address my questions. \n\nI keep my original score.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nSummary: \n\nThis paper proposed a new localized prior PAC-Bayes meta-learning. Specifically, they adopted local coordinate coding (LCC) to replace the previous global hyper-posterior predictive distribution.  Empirical results on few-shot tasks verified its practical benefits.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall review \n\nPros:\n\n[1] This problem is well-motivated. I think such a direction is meaningful. \n\n[2] The high level of proof is technically sound.\n\nCons:\n\n[1] The paper organization indeed requires a better refinement. I can follow the main proof but too many non-important details make the paper rather difficult to follow. \n\n[2] (main concern) The theoretical and practical benefits are not significant. It seems like a plug-in approach for LCC.\n\n[3] Some technical details need better justifications and discussions.\n\nBased on these, I recommend a weak rejection but encourage a major revision for resubmission.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nDetailed explanations\n\n[1] Paper organization\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is Theorem 2 (and an improved Theorem 1). I think more intuitions/insights/discussions about these are expected. In contrast, the definition of Lipschitz and Smooth and Lemma 1,2 are not critical in understanding your main idea. \n\nThis is particularly important in Sec 3, where the main contributions occur. But it is quite difficult to follow the insights in this part. And this also influences the significance of the paper.\n\n[2] The significance of the results\n\nTheoretical perspective:\n\n[a] The author claimed they reach a tighter bound with $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{m})$ (Line 259). I respectfully disagree with this claim. In fact, the author chooses a specific function (smooth property) for deriving a tighter bound. But in the deep network due to the non-linear activation function, this condition can hardly be achieved in practice. Therefore the reason for improving the performance is not the proposed good theory.\n\n[b] I cannot understand why using LCC in meta-Pac-Bayes.  Why not using other clustering-based approaches to set anchor points such as the core-set approach? If there is a **particular** benefit to use LCC rather than other localized approaches, the explanations are highly expected. \n\nSince the whole proof idea is quite similar to Amit (2018) and Pentina (2014) with two-level Pac-Bayes theorems except the LCC part. From the current version, it seems a simple LCC plug-in approach, which hurts its significance.  \n\nPractical Perspective:\n\n[c] The empirical results indicate LCC based PAC-Bayes heavily depend on the number of anchor numbers. i.e if we do not choose the best anchor number, the results can be even worse than the simple baseline ML_AM. \n\n[d] The computational complexity of LML is not reported. I think it can be much higher than ML_AM/ML_PL, which restricts its practical utility.\n\n[e] The analysis of the result can be much better improved. For example, the author claimed better local information extraction. I would like to see clear evidence/analysis  (e.g. TSNE, visualization of anchor points, the relation of different tasks) rather than prediction accuracy curves. This also enhances the significance of LCC.\n\n\n[3] Other minor details\n\n[a] The loss in PAC-Bayes in $[0,1]$, the cross-entropy is surely not.\n\n[b] The Catoni bound (eq 25) the $\\pi$ must not depend on $x_1,\\dots x_n$. This may contradict your data-dependent bound?\n\n[c] Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 are straightforward. I do not think it does not provide strong practical insights into the proposed approach.  \n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSuggestions \n\nI suggest a major revision on Sec 3, theoretical discussions, and empirical analysis (not only accuracy) on the benefits of LCC.\n", "title": "Review #1", "rating": "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold", "confidence": "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"}, "Qt-GM9w5WWV": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "QWBV_TOaXXC", "comment": "Thank you for your thoughtful review.

We respond to each comment as follows.\n\nQ1:Why using LCC.\n A1: We have explained the properties required for constructing prior predictor in line 166-176. Here we propose an LCC-based prior predictor as an example. Because it provides a means to approximate the high-dimensional non-linear function with a global linear function with theoretical guarantees.\n\nQ2: The framework seems a simple LCC plug-in approach\nA2: We follow the two-level proof framework proposed in Amit (2018) and Pentina (2014), but we respectively disagree that it is a simple LCC plug-in approach. In the original setting, meta-knowledge is formulated as a hyperposterior distribution that generates the prior for each task. In LML, we formulate meta-knowledge as a mapping function from task data distribution to the prior, which makes it not trivial to address. Thus, we propose Lemma 1, 2, and LCC based prior predictor, which is novel in itself.\n\nQ3: The choice of anchor numbers. Computation complexity\nA3: As we claimed in line220-224, if we set anchor numbers to 1, it degenerates to the regular meta-learning framework. If we set it to a quite large number, it will suffer from the overfitting issue. We respectively disagree this flexibility is a flaw of LML.  As we described in line 240-243, we utilize an auto-encoder to extract the semantic information of data and then construct the LCC scheme based on the embeddings.  The extra computation cost scales linearly to anchor numbers and embedding size, which is relatively small compared to the base model parameter.\n\nQ4: The loss in PAC-Bayes in [0,1], the cross-entropy is surely not.\nA4: We discussed it in line 476-478.\n\nQ5: The Catoni bound (eq 25) the \u03c0 must not depend on x1,\u2026xn. This may contradict your data-dependent bound?\nA5: We respectively disagree with it. We discussed it in line191, we choose prior upon the task data distribution. Since it is unknown, we approximate it by its empirical counterpart.

We present the formal definition in line 157-165 and the localized meta-learning is implemented with an LCC-based prior predictor.

We will add and discuss it in our next version.\n\nQ2:\u201d How do local anchor points relate to the standard notion of a basis\u201d\nA2: Thanks for your suggestion. Due to space limitations, we have removed the example for LCC in the current version. We will put it in the appendix in our next version. Here the anchor point and the basis have the same meaning.\n\nQ3: \u201cBoth the prior and are spherical Gaussians with the same variance, i.e., they do not allow the variance to adapt through learning. Isn't this a significant limitation?\nA3: In the current version, we follow the setting in \u201cPAC-Bayes bounds with data-dependent priors.\u201d and formulate the prior predictor as a mapping function from task data distribution to the mean of the base model parameter. We only consider the mean for ease of presentation. It should be noted that our framework can be easily extended to the setting considering both the mean and the variance.\n\nQ4: Catoni's bound\nA4: As we claimed in line 121-122, the proof technique is agnostic to the specific single-task bound.

We agree that some existing meta-learning works follow the similar concept, however, they are not derived from the generalization bound. We discuss these in related work in line395-406. Thanks for pointing out these two works. We will include them in the related work section. We want to emphasize that we do not follow the episodic training to address few-shot learning but to explore the PAC-Bayes meta-learning framework [Amit et al. 2018]. As we discussed in line225, to make a fair comparison with PAC-Bayes baselines, we follow the same joint optimization method as Amit et al. 2018 to ensure that the benefit of LML is not from using an improved optimization method. Thus, we also follow the similar meta-learning environment setting as Amit et al. 2018. That is, the meta-learner observes a limited number of tasks (from 1 to 11) and each task has sufficient samples. In this scarce task setting, conventional meta-learning methods following the episodic training paradigm will suffer from the severe task-overfitting issue. We can observe LML significantly outperforms MAML and MatchingNet in Fig 5 and we explain it in line531-538. Thus, we do not compare any improved meta-learning method that follows the episodic training paradigm.

The algorithm is motivated from the PAC-Bayes theory of generalization, extended in recent years to the meta-learning setup, and provides a new localized approach where the prior used for a novel task is allowed to depend on the data from the new task in addition to all previous tasks. They make use of a previously proposed local learning method (LCC) that leads to extra flexibility and to a tightening of the meta-learning bounds, and provide an algorithm based on these bounds from which a learning algorithm is derived based on minimization of the upper bound. Empirical results are provided demonstrating the efficacy of the method and comparing to other recent approaches.  \n\n\nStrong points The problems of meta-learning is of significant current interest and importance, and the theoretical formulation within the widely used and proven PAC-Bayes framework is well founded. Moreover, the authors go beyond current bounds by introducing a localized approach to data-dependent prior learning, deriving an algorithm directly from theoretical bounds, and demonstrating its utility.  \n\nWeak points The paper is difficult to follow making it hard to assess its true novelty. For example, the notion of 'localized learning' is key to the work, but is never defined clearly. Given its important it warrants a clear definition. For instance, in the caption of image 1 they state ''Instead of using global\nmeta-knowledge for all tasks, we tailor the meta-knowledge for various specific task.\" This is not very helpful. If I understand correctly, the main issue is using the LCC approach for determining a data-dependent prior for the new task. Moreover, given the most work on PAC-Bayes theory specifically requires that the prior be data-independent, and that task-dependent priors have only very recently been introduced and analyzed (e.g., Rivasplata et al., PAC-Bayes analysis beyond the usual bounds, NeurIPS 2020 ), this is a major issue that requires clear elaboration.\n\nSpecific issues\n\nThe definition of coordinate coding and the latent manifold require some further elaboration, perhaps through an example. How do local anchor points relate to the standard notion of a basis? \n\nThe authors assume that both the prior and posterior (lines 128-129) are spherical Gaussians with the same variance, i.e., they do not allow the variance to adapt through learning. Isn't this a significant limitation? The same holds for the distribution of v in line 160. Some discussion of this is called for. \n\nThe authors present a bounds based on Catoni's work claiming, correctly, that it allows for faster convergence at a rate of 1/m rather than 1/\\sqrt{m}. However, they refrain from noting that the empirical error is multiplied by a constant that is larger than 1, as opposed to previous bounds. While this may not be an issue for deep networks that have very low empirical error, this should be clearly stated. \n\nThe form of the task-complexity term in eq. (3) and (9) requires further explanation and elaboration given its pivotal role in the work.\n\nIn Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, it is not clear whether you used the  Latent Manifold assumption (Def 3) , and where does it come into play in the bound and in the analysis?\n\nThe optimization of LCC is not explained sufficiently.  Since it is the main part of the innovation, it should be explained more than is done in Appendix B.  Eq. 12 uses L2 distance on the data points, how effective this is in real data sets?\n\nGiven the multiple definitions required for the algorithm, I would urge the authors to include all necessary definitions and equations in Appendix F that contains the pseudo-code. This will greatly facilitate understanding the exact form of the algorithm. \n\nMinor points\nLine 49 - missing Fig number, Definition 3 - change order to  d_M:=|C|, Line 95 - delete b, Line 96 - any point in M (not in R^d). \n\nConcerns \nThe overall idea of the paper is interesting, and, according to my understanding novel and promising. However, I cannot be certain that I have fully understood the paper, given the concerns raised above about lack of clarity. I believe that a clear re-writing of the paper, highlighting the novel contributions of the work and putting it in context (e.g., re new results by Rivasplata mentioned above) is called for. I believe that such a rewriting, assuming the correctness of the proofs in the appendix that I have not checked, will greatly enhance the paper. \n", "title": "The overall idea of the paper is interesting, and, according to my understanding novel and promising.
