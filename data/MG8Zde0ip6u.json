Although password authentication is the most popular authentication mechanism, it has also several drawbacks. Behavioral Biometrics Authentication has emerged as a complementary risk-based authentication approach which aims at profiling users based on their behavior while interacting with computers/smartphones. In this work we propose a novel Siamese Neural Network to perform a few-shot verification of user's behavior. We develop our approach to identify behavior from either human-computer or human-smartphone interaction. For computer interaction our approach learns from mouse and keyboard dynamics, while for smartphone interaction it learns from holding patterns and touch patterns. We show that our approach has a few-shot classification accuracy of up to 99.8% and 90.8% for mobile and web interactions, respectively. We also test our approach on a database that contains over 100K different web interactions collected in the wild.", "keywords": ["Deep Learning", "Few-shot Learning", "Behavioral Biometrics", "Biometric Authentication"]}, "meta": {"decision": "Reject", "comment": "This paper received 3 reviews with mixed initial ratings: 9,4,5.

However, we are the first to apply this type of architecture on the behavioral biometrics field. Our novelty relies on proposing a methodology that couples previous knowledge related to architecture, losses, sample generation and data structures, producing a well-performing model in a new domain. This behavioral domain presents its own difficulties inherent to the nature of biometric data, different from the challenges present in other tasks such as object tracking and face recognition tasks. Furthermore, we have shown that this approach is applicable and scalable to a real production case with thousands or millions of users, which has never been reported before. \n\n**\u201cComparisons with existing methods in the domain have not been included to the main paper (they are supposed to be in the appendix).\"**\n\nWe proved that a better performance is obtained when using a Siamese NNs with a few-shot interaction in comparison to previously studied approaches (SVM, RF, DT).

Moreover, we propose a solution that overcomes implementation and scalability issues from previous approaches, while maintaining or improving performance in the real case. For instance, using only one model for all the users reduces the memory, training and monitoring requirements. Besides, compared with other approaches, we demand less interaction time per user to train and test. Those advantages arise from the few-shot nature of a Siamese NNs. We also contributed by confirming that, with the features proposed, there is an improvement of performance by using a triplet loss instead of a regular pair loss scheme. We would like to highlight that our main contribution is to show real world insights on the intersection between Siamese NNs and few-shot behavioral biometric authentication.

[...]Please acknowledge the contribution of the paper for an ML venue.\u201d**\nRegarding comments on novelty, even though Siamese architectures have been widely studied, their effectiveness on behavioral data has not been explored yet. Our contributions are focused on a practical study in the intersection of biometric data and Siamese architectures. We built suitable feature representations for human-device interactions from different behavioral sources (mouse, keyboard, mobile sensors), that enable the generation of a latent space effective for biometric authentication. Moreover, our proposed methodology for both web and mobile environments shows interesting insights about how biometric data and ML could be integrated in realistic scenarios, setting a precedent for future ML studies in the field. Furthermore, ICLR also encourages (1) studies showing applications on different fields and (2) research on implementation and scalability issues of current state-of-the art systems. Having said that, our work contributes to ML by proposing a one-shot ML framework for biometric data that has been proved in large scale in-the-wild scenarios and over different behavioral sources.  \nAn additional advantage of testing our approach on a large production dataset is that we were able to evaluate the impact of training with different user sample sizes (25K, 50K, 100K). This resulted in similar model performances even when the sample size was 4 times larger. This finding suggests that, for behavioral biometric data, there could be a limit to the representational power of the data in the latent space, this is an interesting insight for future research on Siamese neural networks applied to structured data. \n\n**\u201cThere are zero baselines (no Siamese) compared.\u201d**\nRegarding a baseline, we showed that our chosen representation of human behavioral traits outperforms previous studies, even those using NN, on both web and mobile environments under practical scenarios with short interaction-time periods. On Appendix A, we compared the advantages of our approach against previously studied techniques found in literature. Notably, we are the only approach scalable to large deployments due to the application of one-shot techniques in behavioral biometrics.

Notably, the behavioral characteristics of users when engaging with these devices, measured in the form of mouse movements or keyboard typing patterns on browsers or touch patterns on mobile phones, serve as a proxy for more direct biomarkers such as face recognition, eye scans, etc. The authors argue that the latter requires more specialised hardware and is thus not easily scalable. Instead, they architect the first NN based solution that serves both modalities, web and mobile phones, while trying to be more accurate and responsive.\n\nReview:\n(a) The study is of good quality. The language is clear and concise. Related work is well covered to the best of my knowledge, making reference to one of the oldest instantiations of such model for signature verification.\n\n(b) The originality of the method viz-a-viz the domain 'of biometric verification' seems to be high. In particular, existing solutions to the problem of behavioral biometric verification have either used different models (SVMs or RDTs) or different features or different formulations (classic supervised recognition setting using one model per user). This disposes them to problems such as limited scalability, lower performance and high latency. Herein, their solution of using a single siamese network, for both modalities, and across different users, adds generality, performance and speed. They have curated experiments with different number of users at training time, and using different metric losses (pairwise and triplet) for representation learning via similarity matching, shedding light on the effectiveness of their approach.\n\n(c) That said, originality in terms of research contribution is limited. Siamese NNs have long been in use and recently revisited for variety of vision tasks such as face recognition[1, 2], object tracking [3], etc. The loss formulation used here is also standard, not going beyond the staple pairwise and triplet. Papers where newer losses or network architectures or training paradigms have led to better analysis and results have made sound research contributions and exhibited suitability for the main track e.g. [1, 2]. In other cases, where tasks are key, and results are good but the approach is largely borrowed, it serves good to go for a workshop track e.g. [3].\n\n(d) Comparisons with existing methods in the domain have not been included to the main paper (they are supposed to be in the appendix). The aim perhaps of this paper is to present a baseline NN-based approach for user verification/ biometrics.

I believe this paper makes a relevant contribution to the field since it addresses a topic which is quite interesting for the audience, it is technically sound, covers different hypotheses and provides very useful insight to practitioners about the use of these approaches in real industry applications. The last point is the most interesting in my opinion, honestly. \nThe paper is well structured, with a clean format, very well written and easy to read.\nProbably its weakest point is the novelty, since it addresses a well-known problem using a long-established NN architecture.

I believe the paper needs at least to state clearly whether the train/test split is done by users (where a group of users are employed to perform inference and the rest as control test) or by sequences (where the data from each user is split into train and test).
