This challenge becomes greater when novel tasks contain very few labelled training samples. Currently, most methods are dedicated to class-incremental learning and rely on sufficient training data to learn additional weights for newly added classes. Those methods cannot be easily extended to incremental regression tasks and could suffer from severe overfitting when learning few-shot novel tasks. In this study, we propose a nonparametric method in deep embedded space to tackle incremental few-shot learning problems. The knowledge about the learned tasks are compressed into a small number of quantized reference vectors. The proposed method learns new tasks sequentially by adding more reference vectors to the model using few-shot samples in each novel task. For classification problems, we employ the nearest neighbor scheme to make classification on sparsely available data and incorporate intra-class variation, less forgetting regularization and calibration of reference vectors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. In addition, the proposed learning vector quantization (LVQ) in deep embedded space can be customized as a kernel smoother to handle incremental few-shot regression tasks.

By compressing the learned tasks into a small number of reference vectors, the method could add more reference vectors to the model for each novel task, which could alleviate catastrophic forgetting and improve the performance of related tasks. Finally, this paper evaluates the proposed method on the classification and regression problem, respectively.\n\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe idea of employing reference vectors to address incremental few-shot learning is novel and interesting.\n\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. The writing of this paper is not clear. The authors do not introduce their motivation clearly. For example, in the Introduction Section, the authors said \"To the best of our knowledge, the majority of incremental learning methodologies focus on classification problems and they cannot be extended to regression problems easily.\" Here, the authors should further interpret the reason for this scenario. Meanwhile, compared with classification, the authors should analyze the challenges for the incremental few-shot regression problem. Besides, the authors should interpret the advantages of employing nonparametric method.\n\n2. The method section is hard to understand. I have no idea of the motivation of the proposed method. The authors should give more interpretations of the proposed method. In Section 4.2, the authors indicate the cross-entropy loss does not guarantee compact intra-class variation in the feature space. The authors should give some visualization analyses to demonstrate their opinion. Meanwhile, the authors should analyze the reason. Eq. (2) and Eq. (4) are two simple loss functions. The authors should give more interpretations of why Eq. (2) and Eq. (4) could guarantee intra-class variation and regularize the drift in the feature space.\n\n3. In Table 1 and 2, for the compared methods, the authors should give detailed citations. Besides, for CUB and miniImagNet dataset, the authors only evaluate their method under the 10-way 5-shot and 5-way 5-shot case. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the authors should evaluate their method on more cases. Based on Table 1 and 2, we are not sure whether the proposed method is effective. Besides, the authors should make a visualization analysis to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method contains some hyper-parameters. The authors should analyze the impact of these hyper-parameters.\n\nOverall, though the idea of employing reference vectors is interesting, the motivation of this paper is not clear. The method section is hard to understand. Meanwhile, the experimental results do not demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method sufficiently. The authors do not make a visualization analysis of the proposed method. Thus, I think this paper is below the acceptance.\n\nEDIT: The authors' rebuttals have solved my concerns partially. However, there still exist some concerns about this paper.\n\n1. In the introduction, the authors indicate that nonparametric methods compute the class centroids for novel classes. However, I am not clear whether computing class centroids is the only mechanism to solve class-incremental learning. Besides, I recommend citing more papers about this interpretation.\n\n2. The category centers are usually affected by the number of samples. When the samples are scarce, the constructed centers are not accurate, which affects the performance. The authors should give more discussions about category centers.\n\n3. For the regression problem, it is better to give more implementation details and ablation analyses. Besides, whether MSE is the only loss to train regression network.\n\nBased on these concerns, I update the score to 5.", "title": "This paper is hard to understand.

Figure 2 shows that the performance increases, but the question is whether it still works better than traditional methods in such cases. If it does not, this would reduce the scope of the method considerably.\n\n**Answer**: We appreciate the reviewer to point out the lack of discussion about the case of different numbers of training samples per class in new tasks. We add the full results of 10-way 10-shot and 10-way 20-shot results on CUB dataset in Table 7 and 8. Based on the result, our method is still very effective when more training samples per class are available. We do not experiment more training samples per class because it is beyond the scope of few-shot scenarios. \n\n**Comment**: My second concern is that the authors seem to completely ignore the recent literature on GMM + neural networks. It is a literature that I myself know little about, but I know that it is substantial. Below are some related references. One should confront the proposed method with this literature and not simply say, as said in section 3.2, that this topic has not attracted much attention in the community.\n\n**Answer**: We appreciate the reviewer to point out the lack of review of recent advances of GMM + NN (Prototype + NN). We include relevant papers in our revised version. We did cite 6 papers in section 3.2 related to prototype + NN and ProtoNet by Snell et al. is reimplemented in the experiment section in our original submission. Due to the limit of 8 pages, we only mention papers that are directly related incremental learning and few-shot learning in the original submission.\n\n**Comment**:  I did not find the experimental validation very convincing, as far as the part on incremental learning is concerned. The proposed method is only slightly better than methods that are not at the state of the art level. In this regard, I also noted that recent incremental learning methods were not cited in the state of the art. I invite the authors to look at the papers.\n\n**Answer**: We appreciate the reviewer to point out some recent state-of-the-art papers in incremental learning. We review additional papers in related methods (Hou et al. 2019CVPR is already reviewed in original submission). In addition, we compare with Hou et al. 2019CVPR in the revised version and report the results in Table 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8.

The authors should analyze the impact of these hyper-parameters.\n\n**Answer**: We added visualizations in Appendix (A5, last page) of the revised version to demonstrate feature spaces generated by our proposed method and the standard neural network. We show the visualization with/without Eq (2). The proposed method leads to compact intra-class variation, which helps class-incremental learning. We add the ablation study for Eq (4) in Table 3.\n\n**Comment**: The authors should analyze the impact of these hyper-parameters.\n\n**Answer**: We add the discussion of hyperparameters in appendix A2. Our method only contains two hyperparameters: weight for intra-class loss and weight for less forgetting loss. Empirically, larger $\\lambda_{intra}$ leads to more compact intra-class variation. However, convergence could be slow if  $\\lambda_{intra}$ is too large. In addition, larger $\\lambda_F$ results in less forgetting in old classes but makes learning novel classes more difficult.\n\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer#1"}, "vVXOu8V6sV8": {"type": "rebuttal", "replyto": "k4Js-Hvop2J", "comment": "We appreciate the reviewer for the insightful and constructive comments, and pointing out our typos in the manuscript.\n\n**Comment**: This paper is very related to the work of Xu et al.

The difference between our paper and Xu et al. is summarized below.\n1.\tIn Xu et al., the prototype learning is based on some predefined rules (e.g. when to add prototypes, how to update existing prototypes). They also maintain the link of prototypes to help define the updating rules. In our paper, we use a differentiable loss function to learn the prototypes. Our method combines prototype learning with deep feature extractor in an end-to-end learning fashion, while the method in Xu et al does not use gradient based learning.\n2.\tIn Xu et al., different classes have different numbers of prototypes and the number of prototypes per class is automatically determined. They automatically assign some prototypes close to the boarder of a class. In our method, we use one reference vector per class. Since each class is well separated from each other and has compact intra-class variation, one reference vector per class is sufficient in our method.\n\nWe use ILVQ from Xu et al. on the features from neural networks, and report the results in Table 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the revised version.\n\n**Comment**: In the classification experiments, the paper only reports the average accuracy for all classes the model has been trained on.

Is there a clear reason?\n\n**Answer**: We hoped to compare our methods with the TOPIC in Tao et al., 2020, but the implementation on their official GitHub was (and still is) incomplete. The core algorithm part is not released due to \u201ccommercial frozen period\u201d based on their post on GitHub. After we re-implement ProtoNet and Weight Imprint, we found ProtoNet and Weight Imprint methods performing much better than the reported results of TOPIC in Tao et al. 2020 under the same experiment settings. We therefore decided to compare against only ProtoNet and Weight Imprint.\n\n**Comment**: The incremental few-shot regression is evaluated on artificial toy problems: Sinusoidal Wave and 3D spatial data\n\n**Answer**: As of today there has not been any existing models nor public data set for incremental few-shot regression. Hence, we have no choice but to create our own data sets for regression task. Note that 3D spatial data, the second case study for regression, are real (that is, not synthetic) albeit small. \n\n**Comment**: Bottom first page, it is not explained why incremental learning strategies cannot be extended to regression problems easily.\n\n**Answer**: We add explanation for the reason why existing methods for class-incremental learning cannot be extended to regression in the bottom of Page 1.  \u201c In class-incremental learning, the model has to expand output dimensions to learn N' novel classes while keeping the knowledge of existing N classes.

In comparison, output dimensions in regression problems do not change in incremental learning as neither additional weights nor class centroids are applicable to regression problems. \u201c\n\n**Comment**: Top second page, it is not clear why over-fitting exacerbate the difficulty of learning new classes.\n\n**Answer**: We realized that the sentences in top second page (original submission) could be confusing. We rephrase it as follows: \n\u201cFirst, the model is biased towards new classes and forgets old classes because the model is fine-tuned on new data only. Meanwhile, the prediction accuracy on novel classes is not good due to over-fitting on few-shot training samples.\u201d\n\n**Comment**: How does the method compare with previous approaches in terms of computational cost?\n\n**Answer**: The total parameter size is very similar to the standard neural networks. The computation cost is very close to iCaRL and SDC, which fine-tunes the entire model. The computation cost of our method is higher than ProtoNet and Imprint, because they only recompute the new parameters in the last layer.\n", "title": "Response to Reviewer#2"}, "QsTrfZh8P6A": {"type": "review", "replyto": "3SV-ZePhnZM", "review": "This paper presents a new non-parametric method for few-shot incremental learning.

The idea is to classify input data by maintaining a population of prototypes and measuring the distance of the examples to be classified from these prototypes. As, each prototype represents a class, an example to be classified is assigned to the class of the closest prototype.  The learning of the neural network transforming input data to the prototype space is learned using 2 loss functions: the first one maximizes the margin between the distance to the prototype of the correct class and the other prototypes, the second one makes the clusters as compact as possible.\n\nThe method is experimentally validated on 2 tasks: an incremental image classification task and an incremental regression task.\n\nThe use of generative methods seems a good thing to limit catastrophic forgetting, by anchoring classes on prototypes.
